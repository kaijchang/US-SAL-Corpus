ARTICLE PREMIER.

ARTICLE 1 .

Union constituted. Scope.

Les pays contractants sont constitués à l'état d'Union pour la protection de la propriété industrielle .
La protection de la propriété industrielle a pour objet les brevets d'invention, les modèles d'utilité, les dessins et modèles industriels , les marques de fabrique ou de commerce, le nom commercial et les indications de provenance ou appellations d'origine, ainsi que la répression de la concurrence déloyale.

The contracting countries constitute themselves into a union for the protection of industrial property .
The scope of the protection of industrial property includes patents, utility models, industrial designs and models, trade-marks , commercial names and indications of origin, or appellations of origin, as well as the repression of unfair competition .

INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY CONVENTION. NOV. 6 , 1925.

1797

La propriété industrielle s'entend dans l'acception la plus large, et s'applique non seulement à l'industrie et au commerce proprement dits, mais également au domaine des industries agricoles (vins, grains, feuilles de tabac, fruits , bestiaux, etc. ) et extractives (minéraux, eaux minérales, etc. ) .
Parmi les brevets d'invention
sont comprises les diverses espèces de brevets industriels admises par les législations des pays contractants, telles que brevets d'importation, brevets de perfectionnement, brevets et certificats d'addition , etc.

Industrial property is to be understood in the broadest meaning and is to be applied not only to industry and commerce as such, but likewise to agricultural industries (wines, grain, tobacco leaves, fruit, cattle, etc. ) and extractive industries (minerals, mineral waters , etc. ) .
The term "patents " includes the various types of industrial patents granted by the laws of the contracting countries, such as patents of importation , improvement patents , patents and certificates of addition, etc.

Terms defined. Industrial property.

ARTICLE 2 .

Les ressortissants de chacun des
pays contractants jouiront dans tous les autres pays de l'Union , en ce qui concerne la protection de la propriété industrielle, des avantages que les lois respectives accordent actuellement ou accorderont par la suite aux nationaux, le tout sans préjudice des droits spécialement prévus par la présente Convention. En consé-
quence , ils auront la même protection que ceux-ci et le mêmerecours légal contre toute atteinte portée à leurs droits , sous réserve de l'accomplissement des conditions et formalités imposées aux nationaux.
Toutefois, aucune condition de domicile ou d'établissement dans le pays où la protection est réclamée ne peut être exigée des ressortissants de l'Union, pour la jouissance d'aucun des droits de propriété industrielle.
Sont expressément réservées les
dispositions de la législation de chacun des pays contractants relatives à la procédure judiciaire et administrative et à la compétence , ainsi qu'à l'élection de domicile ou àà llaa ccoonnssttiittuuttiioonn d'un mandataire, qui seraient requises par les lois sur la propriété industrielle .

regards the protection of industrial property, enjoy the advantages that their respective laws nowgrant, or may hereafter grant, to their own nationals, without any prejudice of the rights specially provided by the present convention . Consequently they shall have the same protection as the latter, and the same legal
remedy against any infringement of their rights, provided they observe the conditions and formalities imposed on subjects or citizens .

b) En conséquence, le dépôt ultérieurement opéré dans l'un des autres pays de l'Union , avant l'expiration de ces délais, ne pourra être invalidé par des faits accomplis dans l'intervalle, soit , notamment, par un autre dépôt, par la publication de l'invention ou son exploitation, par la mise en vente d'exemplaires du dessin ou du modèle, par l'emploi de la marque .
c) Les délais de priorité mentionnés ci-dessus seront de douze mois pour les brevets d'invention et les modèles d'utilité et de six mois pour les dessins et modèles industriels et pour les marques de

fabrique ou de commerce. Ces délais commencent à courir

de la date du dépôt de la première demande dans un pays de l'Union ; le jour du dépot n'est pas compris dans le délai .

Si le dernier jour du délai est

(a ) Any person who has duly applied for a patent, the registration of a utility model, industrial design or model, or trademark in one of the contracting countries, or his legal representative or assignee, shall enjoy, subject to the rights of third parties, for the purposes of registration in other countries, a right of priority during the periods hereinafter stated .
(b) Consequently, subsequent filing in any of the other countries of the Union before the expiration of these periods shall not be invalidated through any acts accomplished in the interval, either, particularly, by another filing, by publication of the invention, or by the working of it, by the sale of copies of the design or model , or by use of the trade-mark.
(c) The above-mentioned periods of priority shall be twelve months for patents and utility models , and six months for industrial designs and models and trademarks .
These periods shall start from the date of filing of the first application in a country of the Union ; the day of filing is not counted in this period.
If the last day of the period is a dies non in the country where protection is claimed , the period shall be extended until the next working day .

Ces indications seront mentionnées dans les publications émanant de l'Administration compétente, notamment sur les brevets et les descriptions y relatives .
Les pays contractants pour-
ront exiger de celui qui fait une déclaration de priorité la production d'une copie de la demande (description, dessins , etc. ) déposée antérieurement . La copie, certifiée conforme par l'Administration qui aura reçu cette demande, sera dispensée de toute légalisation, et elle pourra en tous cas être déposée à n'importe quel moment dans le délai de trois mois à dater du dépôt de la demande ultérieure . On pourra exiger qu'elle soit accompagnée d'un certificat de la date du dépôt émanant de cette Administration et d'une traduction .
D'autres formalités ne pour-
ront être requises pour la déclaration de priorité au moment du dépôt de la demande. Chaque pays contractant déterminera les conséquences de l'omission des formalités prévues par le présent article, sans que ces conséquences puissent excéder la perte du droit de priorité.
Ultérieurement d'autres justifications pourront être demandées .
e) Lorsqu'un dessin ou modèle industriel aura été déposé dans un pays en vertu d'un droit de priorité basé sur le dépôt d'un modèle d'utilité, le délai de priorité ne sera que celui fixé pour les dessins et modèles industriels .
En outre, il est permis de déposer dans un pays un modèle d'utilité en vertu d'un droit de priorité basé sur le dépôt d'une demande de brevet et inversement.

At later stages, further proof in support of the application may be required .
(e) Where an application is ityRemgoidsterla.tion of a utilfiled in a country for the registration of an industrial design or model by virtue of a right of priority based on the registration of a utility model, the period of priority shall not exceed that fixed for industrial designs and models .
Furthermore, it is allowable to deposit in a country a utility model by virtue of rights of priority based on a patent application, and vice versa .

INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY CONVENTION. NOV. 6, 1925.

Division of claims for multiple priority, etc. f) Si une demande de brevet
contient la revendication de priorités multiples, ou si l'examen révèle qu'une demande est complexe, l'Administration devra,
tout au moins, autoriser le demandeur à la diviser dans des
conditions que déterminera la législation intérieure, en conser-
vant comme date de chaque demande divisionnaire la date de la
demande initiale et, s'il y a lieu, le bénéfice du droit de priorité.

(f) If an application for a patent contains claims for multiple priority, or if examination discloses that the application contains more than one invention, the competent authorities must at least allow the applicant to divide it, subject to the conditions of internal legislation , reserving as date of each divisional application the date of the initial application and, if there is occasion for it, the benefits of the right of priority.

Les brevets demandés dans les

différents pays contractants par

des ressortissants de l'Union se-

ront indépendants des brevets

obtenus pour la même invention

dans les autres pays, adhérents ou non à l'Union .

Cette disposition doit s'entendre

d'une façon absolue, notamment en ce sens que les brevets de-

mandés pendant le délai de priorité sont indépendants, tant au

point de vue des causes de nullité et de déchéance, qu'au point de vue de la durée normale.

Elle s'applique à tous les brevets existant au moment de sa mise en vigueur.
Il en sera de même, en cas d'accession de nouveaux pays, pour les brevets existant de part et d'autre au moment de l'accession.

Patents applied for in the various contracting countries by nationals of the Union shall be inde-
pendent of the patents obtained for the same invention in other countries, whether such countries be or be not parties to the Union .
This stipulation must receive a strict interpretation ; inparticular, it shall be understood to mean that patents applied for during the period of priority are independent, both as regards the grounds for refusal and for revocation, and also as regards their normal duration .
This stipulation shall apply to
all patents already existing at the time when it shall come into effect.
The same stipulation shall apply, in the case of the accession of new countries, to patents in existence, either on one side or the other, at the time of accession.

Prevention ofabuses. Toutefois chacun des pays con-
tractants aura la faculté de prende les mesures législatives nécessaires pour prévenir les abus qui pourraient résulter de l'exercice du droit exclusif conféré par le
brevet, par exemple faute d'exploitation.

The introduction by the pat-
entee into the country where the patent has been granted of objects manufactured in any of the countries of the Union shall not entail forfeiture .
Nevertheless , each of the contracting countries shall have the right to take the necessary legislative measures to prevent the abuses which might result from the exercise of the exclusive rights
conferred by the patent ; for example, failure to use.

Ces mesures ne pourront prévoir la déchéance du brevet que si la concession de licenses obligatoires ne suffisait pas pour prévenir ces abus.
En tout cas, le brevet ne pourra
pas faire l'objet de telles mesures avant l'expiration d'au moins 3 années à compter de la date où il a été accordé et si le breveté
justifie d'excuses légitimes. La protection des dessins et
modèles industriels ne peut être atteinte par une déchéance quelconque pour introduction d'objets conformes à ceux quisont protégés .
Aucun signe ou mention d'enregistrement ne sera exigé sur le produit, pour la reconnaissance du droit.

Un délai de grâce, qui devra être au minimum de trois mois, sera accordé pour le payement des taxes prévues pour le maintien des droits de propriété industrielle, moyennant le versement d'une surtaxe, si la législation nationale en impose une.
Pour les brevets d'invention, les pays contractants s'engagent en outre, soit à porter le délai de grâce à six mois au moins, soit à prévoir la restauration du brevet tombé en déchéance par suite de non payement de taxes, ces mesures restant soumises aux conditions prévues par la législation intérieure.

A period of grace of at least Concession for paythree months will be granted for ing taxes, etc. the payment of taxes prescribed for the maintenance of industrialproperty rights, together with a surcharge if the internal legislation of a country so provides.

En aucun cas le renouvellement
de l'enregistrement d'une marque dans le pays d'origine n'entraînera l'obligation de renouveler l'enregistrement dans les autres pays de l'Union où la marque aura été enregistrée .
Le bénéfice de la priorité reste acquis aux dépôts de marques effectués dans le délai de l'art. 4 , même lorsque l'enregistrement dans le pays d'origine n'intervient qu'après l'expiration de ce délai .
La disposition de l'alinéa 1 n'exclut pas le droit d'exiger du déposant un certificat d'enregistrement régulier, délivré par l'autorité compétente du pays d'origine, mais aucune légalisation ne sera requise pour ce certificat .

The requisite extension of the duration of the Treaty of Alliance is provided for by article 1 of the new treaty. In submitting this treaty to the Council, His Majesty's Government declare that so long as it remains in force they will regard as binding the undertakings given by them to the Council in September 1924, and will continue to act in conformity therewith.

such aircraft complies with the airworthiness requirements of each of the states named in said certificate.
The aircraft commander shall at all times hold the certificate in

his custody and shall deliver it for inspection and verification to the authorized representatives of the state which said aircraft visits.

Each contracting state shall communicate to the other states parties to this convention and to the Pan American Union its regulations governing the rating of its aircraft as to airworthiness and

shall similarly communicate any changes made therein. While the states affirm the principle that the aircraft of each con-
tracting state shall have the liberty of engaging in air commerce with the other contracting states without being subjected to the licensing system of any state with which such commerce is carried on, each and every contracting state mentioned in the certificate of

airworthiness reserves the right to refuse to recognize as valid the certificate of airworthiness of any foreign aircraft where inspection by a duly authorized commission of such state shows that the air-

craft is not, at the time of inspection, reasonably airworthy in accordance with the normal requirements of the laws and regulations of such state concerning the public safety.

In such cases said state may refuse to permit further transit by the aircraft through its air space until such time as it, with due regard to the public safety, is satisfied as to the airworthiness of the aircraft, and shall immediately notify the state whose nationality the aircraft possesses and the Pan American Union of the action taken.

ARTICLE XIII

Such certificate or certificates shall set forth that each pilot, in addition to having fulfilled the requirements of the state issuing the same, has passed a satisfactory examination with regard to the traffic rules existing in the other contracting states over which he desires to fly. The requirements of form of said documents shall be uniform throughout all the contracting states and shall be drafted in the language of all of them, and for this purpose the Pan American Union is charged with making the necessary arrangements amongst the contracting states.
Such certificate or certificates shall be held in the possession of the aircraft commander as long as the pilots, engineers and other members of the operating crew concerned continue to be employed on the aircraft. Upon the return of such certificate an authenticated copy thereof shall be retained in the files of the aircraft.

Such certificate or certificates shall be open at all times to the inspection of the duly authorized representatives of any state visited .
Each contracting state shall communicate to the other states parties to this convention and to the Pan American Union its regulations

governing the issuance of such certificates and shall from time to time communicate any changes made therein.

lar cuentas por gastos de tránsito marítimo, relativas al transporte

de correspondencia a que afecten los aludidos contratos .

2. Cada uno de los países

contratantes se compromete a mantener los privilegios que gocen actualmente los barcos de los demás países de la Unión Postal de las Américas y España que transportan gratuitamente la correspondencia, así como a concederles en lo futuro todos los privi-

legios que otorguen a los barcos de cualquier otro país que efectúen dicho servicio .

1. If, at the time when the Convention enters into force, a country cannot concede gratuity of transit because stipulations of existing contracts concluded previously are opposed to it, that country obligates itself to modify such contracts so as to make said
gratuity effective as soon as possible. All contracts which are renewed or those which may be concluded in the future shall as-
sure complete gratuity of transit for correspondence transported in ships which are affected by said contracts, between the various ports of the Americo-Spanish postal territory, as well as between the latter and those of countries
foreign to the Union .
In spite of the existence of those contracts which impede the application of the principle of gratuity of transit, no Postal Administration may present accounts for maritime transit charges relative to the transportation of correspondence affected by the aforesaid contracts .
2. Each of the contracting countries obligates itself to maintain the privileges which the ships of the other countries of the Postal Union of the Americas and Spain transporting correspond-
ence gratuitously are at present enjoying, as well as to concede to them in the future all the privileges which they extend to ships of any other country that perform said service .

II
Transit of advertiseIn view of the fact that adver- ments. tisements constitute a useful and
convenient medium for the spreading of information which
tends to increase the knowledge of the peoples, the Congress is of the opinion that articles of that nature should be transported in the international postal service

English text.

CONVENTION

[Maritime Neutrality]

Governments repreThe Governments of the Republics represented at the Sixth Inter- sented.
national Conference of American States, held in the city of Habana ,
Republic of Cuba, in the year 1928 ; Desiring that, in case war breaks out between two or more states Purposes declared.

the other states may, in the service of peace, offer their good offices or mediation to bring the conflict to an end, without such an action being considered as an unfriendly act ;
Convinced that, in case this aim cannot be attained , neutral states have equal interest in having their rights respected by the belligerents ;
Considering that neutrality is the juridical situation of states which do not take part in the hostilities, and that it creates rights and imposes obligations of impartiality, which should be regulated ;
Recognizing that international solidarity requires that the liberty of commerce should be always respected, avoiding as far as possible unnecessary burdens for the neutrals ;
It being convenient, that as long as this object is not reached , to reduce those burdens as much as possible ; and
In the hope that it will be possible to regulate the matter so that all interests concerned may have every desired guaranty ;
Have resolved to formulate a convention to that effect and have
appointed the following plenipotentiaries : Peru : Jesús Melquiades Salazar, Víctor Maúrtua, Enrique Castro
Oyanguren, Luis Ernesto Denegri .

d'avarie due à la force majeure, telle qu'elle est définie par les jugements de tribunaux ou les prescriptions du pays dans le territoire duquel le fait s'est produit, l'expéditeur ou un autre ayant droit peut prétendre à une indemnité correspondant au montant réel de la perte, de la spoliation ou de l'avarie, d'après la valeur au lieu et à l'époque où la marchandise a été acceptée au transport, lorsqu'un colis avec valeur déclarée a été perdu , spolié ou avarié, à moins que le dommage n'ait été causé par la faute ou la négligence de l'expéditeur, du destinataire ou de leur représentant, ou ne provienne de la nature de l'objet. Toutefois , le montant de l'indemnité ne peut être supérieur à la somme assurée sur laquelle la taxe à la valeur a été perçue dans le pays d'origine ou au maximum de 100 dollars (500 francs-or) . Les deux Administrations peuvent cependant s'entendre , par voie de correspondance, pour fixer une indemnité plus élevée .
3. Aucune des deux Adminis-

4. Lorsqu'un colis avec valeur déclarée provenant d'un pays et destiné à être remis dans l'autre

However, the amount of the indemnity may not be greater than the amount for which insured, on which the insurance fee has been collected in the country of origin, or the maximum amount of $ 100 ( 500 gold francs) . The two Administrations may, however, agree by correspondence to fix a higher indemnity.

4. When an insured parcel ori- a tPhairrcdelcsofuonrtwrayr. ded to ginating in one country and destined to be delivered in the other country is reforwarded from

L'application de cette prescription ne préjudicie aucunement l'action judiciaire qui pourrait être intentée au réclamant, du fait de pareilles indications frauduleuses .
10. En cas de perte , de spoliation ou d'avarie d'un colis avec valeur déclarée, l'Administration d'origine doit payer l'indemnité à l'ayant droit le plus tôt possible et, au plus tard, dans le délai d'un an à compter du lendemain du jour de la réclamation .

Il est recommandé d'insérer un double de l'adresse dans chaque colis, surtout lorsque l'usage d'une étiquette volante est rendu nécessaire par le conditionnement ou par la forme de l'envoi.
Les colis dont l'adresse de
l'expéditeur ou du destinataire consiste en initiales seulement ne sont pas admis , exception faite des désignations commerciales (raisons sociales) composées d'initiales.
Les adresses au crayon ne
sont pas admises . Sont toutefois
acceptées les adresses écrites au crayon-encre, sur un fond préalablement mouillé.
2. Les colis contenant des es-
pèces monnayées, de l'or ou de l'argent en barres, des pierreries ou autres matières précieuses
doivent toujours être expédiés avec déclaration de valeur.
Lorsqu'un colis contenant des objets de l'espèce est expédié sans déclaration de valeur , l'office postal qui remarque l'erreur en

1. The name and address of the sender and of the addressee must be written , legibly and correctly, if possible on the parcel itself, or on a label affixed securely to the parcel .
It is recommended that a duplicate of the address be inclosed in every parcel, especially when the use of a tag is rendered necessary by the packing or form of the parcel .

premier lieu est tenu de le traiter comme colis avec valeur déclarée et d'aprés les dispositions de son pays.
3. Chaque colis doit être emballé de manière que le contenu soit préservé pendant toute la durée du transport. Les colis avec valeur déclarée doivent être
scellés par des cachets à la cire , par des plombs ou par un autre moyen équivalent . Pour les colis ordinaires, un ficelage soigneux suffit comme moyen de fermeture, mais ils peuvent aussi être scellés.
Comme mesure de sécurité, chaque Administration peut exiger qu'une empreinte ou marque spéciale de l'expéditeur figure sur les plombs ou cachets de fermeture des colis avec valeur déclarée .
L'Administration des douanes
du pays de destination est autorisée à ouvrir les colis. A cet effet , les cachets ou toute autre fermeture peuvent être brisés ou rompus. Les envois ouverts par la douane doivent être refermés et , en outre, scellés d'office, si l'expéditeur les avait scellés.
4. Pour les colis avec valeur déclarée , le montant de la valeur déclarée doit figurer tant sur le colis que sur le bulletin d'expédition .
5. Chaque colis avec valeur déclarée doit porter du côté de l'adresse un numéro (insurance number) , et l'indication " insured" , "valeur déclarée " ou "V ".
6. Les étiquettes ou timbresposte apposés sur les colis avec valeur déclarée doivent être espacés afin qu'ils ne puisent servir à cacher des lésions de l'emballage. Ils ne doivent pas, non plus, être repliés sur deux faces de l'emballage, de manière à couvrir la bordure.

3. Each parcel must be packed in such a manner that the contents are protected over the whole route. Insured parcels must be sealed with wax or lead or by some equivalent means. For ordinary parcels, careful tying is sufficient as a mode of closing, but they may also be sealed .
As a protective measure, either Administration may require that a special imprint or mark of the sender appear on the wax or lead seals closing insured parcels .
The Customs Administration of the country of destination is authorized to open the parcels. To that end, the seals or any other fastenings may be broken. Parcels opened by the customs must be refastened and also officially sealed , if the sender has sealed them .
4. For insured parcels, the amount of the insured value shall appear both on the parcel and on the dispatch note.
5. Each insured parcel must bear on the address side an insurance number and the notation " Insured " , "Valeur déclarée" , or "V".
6. The labels or postage stamps affixed to insured parcels must be spaced so that they cannot serve to conceal injuries to the packing. Neither must they be folded over two faces of the wrapping so as to cover the edge.
7. Liquids and easily liquefiable substances must be sent in a double receptacle . Between the first (bottle, flask, box, etc. ) and the second (box of metal , strong wood, or strong carton of fibreboard, or receptacle of equal

Les prisonniers ne seront pas inutilement exposés au danger, en attendant leur évacuation d'une zone de combat.
L'évacuation à pied des prisonniers ne pourra se faire normalement que par étapes de 20 kilomètres par jour, à moins que la nécessité d'atteindre les dépôts d'eau et de nourriture n'exige de plus longues étapes .

Prisoners of war shall be evacu-
ated within the shortest possible period after their capture, to depots located in a region far enough from the zone of combat for them to be out of danger.

Prisoners shall not be needlessly exposed to danger while awaiting their evacuation from the combat zone .
Evacuation of prisoners on foot may normally be effected only by stages of 20 kilometers a day, unless the necessity of reaching water and food depots requires longer stages.

ANNEX TO THE CONVENTION Annex to the ConOF JULY 27, 1929, RELATIVE vention. TO THE TREATMENT OF PRISONERS OF WAR.

ACCORD-TYPE CONCERNANT LE RAPATRIEMENT DIRECT ET L'HOSPITALISATION EN PAYS NEUTRE DES PRISONNIERS DE GUERRE POUR RAISONS DE SANTÉ.

MODEL AGREEMENT CONCERNING DIRECT REPATRIATION AND HOSPITALIZATION IN A NEUTRAL COUNTRY OF PRISONERS OF WAR FOR REASONS OF HEALTH .

I.-Principes directeurs pour le rapatriement direct et l'hos-
pitalisation en pays neutre.

I. Governing Principles for Direct Repatriation and Hospitalization in a Neutral Country.

A. RAPATRIEMENT DIRECT.

A. DIRECT REPATRIATION .

Seront rapatriés directement :
1 ° les malades et blessés dont, d'après les prévisions médicales , la curabilité en une année n'est pas présumable, leur état exigeant un traitement, et leur aptitude intellectuelle ou corporelle paraissant avoir subi une diminution considérable ;
2º les malades et blessés in-
curables dont l'aptitude intellectuelle ou corporelle paraît avoir subi une diminution considérable ;
3º les malades et blessés guéris dont l'aptitude intellectuelle ou corporelle paraît avoir subi une diminution considérable.

There shall be repatriated directly :
1. Sick and wounded who , according to medical opinion , are not likely to recover in one year, their condition requiring treatment and their mental or physical fitness appearing to have suffered considerable diminution ;
2. Incurable sick and wounded
whose mental or physical fitness appears to have suffered considerable diminution ;
3. Cured sick and wounded whose mental or physical fitness appears to have suffered considerable diminution .

B.- HOSPITALISATION EN PAYS B. HOSPITALIZATION IN A NEUTRAL

NEUTRE .

COUNTRY .

Seront hospitalisés :
1 ° les malades et blessés dont la guérison est présumable dans le délai d'un an, cette guérison apparaissant comme plus sûre et plus rapide si les malades et blessés sont mis au bénéfice des ressources qu'offre le pays neutre que si leur captivité proprement dite est prolongée ;

There shall be placed in hospitals :
1. Sick and wounded whose cure within a period of one year is
to be expected , such cure appearing more certain and more rapid if the sick and wounded are given the benefit of the resources offered
by the neutral country than if their captivity properly so-called is prolonged ;

2068 MULTILATERAL CONVENTION-WAR PRISONERS. JULY 27,1929.

Annex-Continued.

2º les prisonniers de guerre dont la santé intellectuelle ou physique paraît, d'après les prévisions médicales, menacées sérieusement par le maintien en captivité, tandis que l'hospitalisation en pays
neutre pourrait probablement les soustraire à ce risque.

2. Prisoners of war whose men-
tal or physical health appears , according to medical opinion, to be seriously menaced by continuance in captivity, while hospitalization in a neutral country would probably remove this danger.

C.-RAPATRIEMENT DES HOSPITALISÉS EN PAYS NEUTRE .

C. REPATRIATION OF THOSE HOSPITALIZED IN A NEUTRAL COUNTRY .

Seront rapatriés les prisonniers de guerre hospitalisés en pays neutre qui appartiennent aux catégories suivantes :
1° ceux dont l'état de santé se
présente comme étant ou devenant tel qu'ils rentrent dans les catégories des rapatriables pour raisons de santé;
2º les guéris dont l'aptitude intellectuelle ou physique paraît avoir subi une diminution considérable .

There shall be repatriated the
prisoners of war hospitalized in a neutral country who belong to the following categories :
1. Those whose state of health
appears to be or to be becoming such that they fall within the categories of persons eligible to repatriation for reasons of health ;
2. The recovered whose mental
or physical fitness seems to have suffered a considerable diminution .

II.-Principes spéciaux pour le rapatriement direct ou l'hos-
pitalisation en pays neutre.

II . Special Principles for Direct Repatriation or Hospitalization in a Neutral Country.

A.- RAPATRIEMENT.

atteints, à la suite de lésions organiques, des altérations suivantes, effectives ou fonction-
nelles : perte de membre, paralysie, altérations articulaires ou autres, pour autant que le défect est d'au moins un pied ou une main, ou qu'il équivaut à la perte d'un pied ou d'une main ;
2° tous les prisonniers de guerre blessés ou lésés dont l'état est tel
qu'il fait d'eux des infirmes dont on ne peut pas, médicalement , prévoir la guérison dans le délai d'un an;
3° tous les malades dont l'état
est tel qu'il fait d'eux des infirmes dont on ne peut pas, médicalement, prévoir la guérison dans le délai d'un an ;

There shall be repatriated : 1. All prisoners of war who, as the result of organic injuries, have the following impairments, actual or functional: loss of a member,
paralysis, articular or other defects, provided that the loss is at least a foot or a hand, or is equivalent to the loss of a foot or a hand ;

B.- HOSPITALISATION .

B. HOSPITALIZATION.

Les prisonniers de guerre doi-
vent être hospitalisés s'ils sont atteints des affections suivantes :
1° toutes les formes de tuber-
culose d'organes quelconques, si, d'après les connaissances médicales actuelles, elles peuvent être guéries , ou du moins considérablement améliorées par les méthodes applicables en pays neutre (altitude, traitement dans les sanatoria, etc. ) ;
2° toutes les formes-nécessitant un traitement d'affections
des organes respiratoires, circulatoires, digestifs, génito -urinaires, nerveux, des organes des sens, des appareils locomoteur et cutané, à condition , toutefois , que

Prisoners of war must be hos-
pitalized if they have the following affections :
1. All forms of tuberculosis of
any organs whatever if, according to present medical knowledge, they may be cured, or at least considerably improved by methods applicable in a neutral country (altitude, treatment in sanatoria, etc. ) ;
2. All forms- necessitating treatment of affections of the respiratory , circulatory, digestive, genito-urinary, and nervous organs, of organs of the senses , of the locomotor and cutaneous apparatus ; provided , however, that

MULTILATERAL CONVENTION-WAR PRISONERS. JULY 27,1929. 2071

ces formes d'affections n'appartiennent pas aux catégories prescrivant le rapatriement direct, ou qu'elles ne soient pas des maladies aiguës proprement dites ayant une tendance à la guérison franche . Les affections envi-
sagées dans ce paragraphe sont celles qui offrent par l'application des moyens de cure disponibles en
pays neutre des chances de guérison réellement meilleures pour le patient que si celui-ci était traité en captivité.
Il y a lieu de considérer tout
spécialement les troubles nerveux dont les causes efficientes ou

the forms of these affections do not belong to the categories requiring direct repatriation , or are not acute diseases properly so-called susceptible to a complete cure . The affections contemplated in this paragraph are those which offer really better chances of cure for the patient by the application of means of treatment available in a neutral country than if he were treated in captivity .
Nervous troubles, the efficient or determinant causes of which are the events of the war or even

Annex-Continued,

déterminantes sont les événements de la guerre ou de la captivité même, comme la psychasthénie des prisonniers de guerre et autres cas analogues .
Tous les cas de ce genre dûment constatés doivent être hospitalisés, pour autant que leur gravité ou leurs caractères constitutionnels n'en font pas des cas de rapatriement direct.
Les cas de psychasthénie des prisonniers de guerre qui ne sont pas guéris après trois mois d'hospitalisation en pays neutre ou qui, après ce délai , ne sont pas manifestement en voie de guérison définitive, devront être rapatriés .
3º tous les cas de blessures, de

of the captivity itself, such as the psychasthenia of prisoners of war and other analogous cases, should be given special consideration .
All duly verified cases of this kind should be hospitalized , provided that the seriousness or constitutional character thereof does not make them cases for direct repatriation .
Cases of psychasthenia of prisoners of war which are not cured after three months of hospitalization in a neutral country or which, after this period has expired , are not obviously on the road to final recovery, should be repatriated .
3. All cases of wounds or lesions

lésions et leurs conséquences qui offrent des chances de guérison meilleures en pays neutre qu'en captivité, à condition que ces cas ne soient pas, ou bien justiciables du rapatriement direct, ou bien insignifiants ;
4º tous les cas de malaria dûment constatés et ne présentant pas d'altérations organiques décelables cliniquement (augmentation de volume chronique du foie, de la rate, cachexie, etc. ) , si le séjour en pays neutre offre des perspectives particulièrement favorables de guérison définitive ;
5º tous les cas d'intoxication

and their consequences which offer better chances of cure in a neutral country than in captivity, provided that these cases are not either eligible for direct repatriation or else are insignificant ;
4. All cases of malaria, duly verified and not presenting organic changes clinically discoverable (chronic enlargement of the liver, of the spleen , cachexia, etc. ) , if the stay in a neutral_country offers particularly favorable prospects of final cure ;
5. All cases of poisoning (par-

(en particulier par les gaz, les métaux, les alcaloides ) pour les quels les perspectives de guérison en pays neutre sont spécialement favorables .

ticularly by gases, metals, alkaloids) for which the prospects of cure in a neutral country are especially favorable.

ARTICLE XX
Consular officers of either High Contracting Party may, within their respective consular districts, address the authorities concerned, National, State, Provincial or Municipal, for the purpose of protecting the nationals of the State by which they are appointed in the enjoyment of their rights accruing by treaty or otherwise . Complaint may be made for the infraction of those rights. Failure upon the part of the proper authorities to grant redress or to accord protection may justify interposition through the diplomatic channel, and in the absence of a diplomatic representative , a consul general or the consular officer stationed at the capital may apply directly to the Government of the country.

MR. SECRETARY OF STATE : During the negotiations relating to the conclusion of the Treaty of
Friendship , Commerce and Consular Rights , which to-day has been signed , I was given to understand that under the present tariff laws of the United States Norwegian Sardines are accorded the same tariff treatment as sardines imported from any other country and that such equality of treatment would be continued under the most favored nation provision of the Treaty. Upon the request of my Government I have the honor to inform Your Excellency that my Government would appreciate very much to receive, if this be found possible, a communication from Your Excellency, stating that the tariff treatment of the Norwegian Sardines is as above mentioned .
Please accept, Mr. Secretary of State, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration .

The Secretary of State (Kellogg) to the Norwegian Minister (Bachke)

DEPARTMENT OF STATE,

SIR :

Washington, June 5, 1928.

In reply I am happy to confirm the correctness of your under-

standing, as above recited , of the equality of treatment which is now accorded under the tariff laws of the United States, and will continue

to be accorded under the most-favored-nation provision of the treaty, to Norwegian sardines .

Accept, Sir, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration. FRANK B. KELLOGG

Desirous of reaffirming their adherence to the policy of submitting to impartial decision all justiciable controversies that may arise between them ; and
Eager by their example not only to demonstrate their condemnation of war as an instrument of national policy in their mutual relations, but also to hasten the time when the perfection of international arrangements for the pacific settlement of international disputes shall have eliminated forever the possibility of war among any of the Powers of the world ;
Have decided to conclude a treaty of arbitration and for that purpose they have appointed as their respective Plenipotentiaries

leur adhésion à la politique consistant à soumettre à une décision impartiale toutes contestations susceptibles de décisions judiciaires qui viendraient à s'élever entre eux ;
Soucieux, par leur exemple, non seulement de manifester que, dans
leurs relations réciproques, ils condamnent la guerre comme instrument de politique nationale, mais encore de hâter le moment où la conclusion d'accords internationaux pour le règlement pacifique des conflits entre les Etats aura écarté pour toujours les possibilités de guerre entre les nations du monde ;

Indemnity.

1. Except in cases of loss or damage through force majeure (causes beyond control ) as that term is defined by the legal decisions or rulings of the country in the service of which the loss or damage occurs, when an insured parcel has been lost, rifled , or damaged, the sender, or other rightful claimant, is entitled to an indemnity corresponding to the actual amount of loss, rifling or damage, based on the actual value at the time and place of mailing of the lost, rifled, or damaged article, unless the loss, rifling, or damage has arisen from the fault or negligence of the sender or the addressee or of the representative of either or from the nature of the article, provided that the indemnity shall not exceed the sum for which the
required insurance fee was paid in the country of origin. While, as stated in the preceding paragraph, the Administrations
are not obligated to pay indemnity in the case of loss or damage due to force majeure, either Administration may, at its option and without recourse to the other Administration, pay indemnity for loss or damage due to force majeure even in the cases where the Administration of the country in the service of which the loss or damage occurred recognizes that the damage was due to force majeure.

Indemnity- Continued .

2. In the absence of special agreement to the contrary between

the countries involved (which agreement may be made through corre-

spondence) no indemnity will be paid by either country for the loss,

rifling, or damage of transit registered or insured parcels originating

in one of the two contracting countries addressed for delivery in

some other country not a party to this Convention or originating in

a third country addressed for delivery to one of the two contracting countries.

3. In case an insured parcel originating in one country and addressed for delivery in the other country is forwarded or returned from the country of original address to a third country, the rightful claimant shall be entitled to only such indemnity, if any, for any

loss, rifling, or damage which occurs subsequent to the redespatch of the parcel in the country of original address, as the country in which the loss, rifling, or damage occurred is willing or obligated to pay under any agreement in force between the countries directly involved
in the forwarding or return. Either country adhering to this Convention which improperly forwards an insured parcel to a third country, shall be responsible therefor to the extent of liability of the country of origin to the sender within the limit of indemnity fixed by this Convention.
4. No application for indemnity will be entertained unless a claim or an initial inquiry, oral or written, shall be filed by claimant or his representative within a year commencing with the day following the posting of the insured parcel.
5. No compensation shall be given for loss, injury, or damage consequential upon , i. e., indirectly arising from, the loss, nonde-
livery, damage, misdelivery, or delay of any insured parcel transmitted under this Convention, nor for parcels seized by the Customs because of false declaration of contents.

6. No indemnity will be paid for insured parcels which contain matter of no intrinsic value nor for perishable matter or matter prohibited transmission in the parcel post mails exchanged between the contracting Administrations, or which did not conform to the stipulations of this Convention, or which were not posted in the manner prescribed , but the country responsible for the loss, rifling, or damage may pay indemnity in respect of such parcels without recourse to the other Administration.

7. Either of the Administrations may at its option reimburse the rightful claimant in the event of complete loss, irreparable damage of entire contents or rifling of entire contents for the amount of postage or special charges borne by an insured parcel, if claimed . The insurance fees are not in any case returned.
8. No responsibility will be admitted for insured parcels which can not be accounted for in consequence of the destruction of official documents through causes beyond control.
9. In case the sender, addressee, or owner of an insured parcel, or his representative, shall at any time knowingly allege the contents to be above their real value, or whenever any false, fictitious, or fraudulent evidence is knowingly and wilfully introduced, the Administration responsible for the indemnity reserves the right without any refund of fee or postage to decline to pay indemnity or to pay such indemnity as may in its discretion be considered equitable in the light of the evidence produced . The enforcement of this rule shall not prejudice any legal proceedings to which such fraudulent evidence may have rendered the claimant liable.

10. When an insured article has been lost, rifled, or damaged , the Administration of origin shall pay indemnity to the rightful claim-

11. However, the Administration of origin may, in the cases indicated in the foregoing section, exceptionally defer payment of indemnity for a longer period than that stipulated if, at the expiration of that period, it has not been able to determine the disposition made of the article in question or the responsibility incurred.
12. Except in cases where payment is exceptionally deferred as provided in the foregoing section, the country of origin is authorized to pay indemnity on behalf of the country of destination if that country has, after being duly informed of the application for indemnity, let nine months pass without settling the matter.
13. The obligation of paying the indemnity shall rest with the country to which the mailing office is subordinate. That country
can make a claim on the country responsible, that is to say, against the Administration on the territory or in the service of which the loss, rifling, or damage took place.
14. The country responsible for the loss, rifling, or damage and on whose account payment is made is bound to repay to the country making payment on its behalf, without delay and within not more than nine months after receiving notice of payment, the amount of indemnity paid.
15. Reimbursements for indemnity from one country to the other shall be made on the gold basis.
16. Repayments are to be made free of cost to the creditor country by means of either a money order or a draft, or in money valid in the creditor country, or by such other means as may be mutually agreed upon by correspondence.
17. Until the contrary is proved, responsibility for an insured parcel rests with the country which, having received the parcel without making any observation and being furnished all necessary particulars for inquiry, is unable to show its proper disposition.
If the loss, abstraction, or damage has occurred in the course of conveyance without its being possible to ascertain in which service the irregularity took place, the Postal Administrations concerned bear the loss in equal shares.
18. Responsibility for loss, rifling, or damage of an insured parcel discovered by the receiving office of exchange at the time of opening the receptacles and duly notified to the despatching office of exchange by bulletin of verification, shall fall upon the Administration to which the despatching office of exchange is subordinate unless it be proved that the loss, rifling, or damage occurred in the service of the receiving Administration.
19. The responsibility of properly enclosing, packing, and sealing insured parcels rests upon the sender, and the postal service of neither country will assume liability for loss, rifling, or damage arising from defects which may not be observed at the time of posting.

PROTOCOL OF EXCHANGE

The undersigned, the Secretary of State of the United States of America and the Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary

Protocol of exchange.

of Greece at Washington, met this day for the purpose of exchanging the ratifications of the extradition treaty between the United States of America and Greece, signed at Athens on May 6 , 1931 .

It being found on a comparison of the respective ratifications that

the words " insurance and other companies," in Article 2 , paragraph Ante, p. 2187.

10 , of the English text of the treaty as contained in the Greek instru-

ment of ratification, are not contained in that article and paragraph as it appears in the English text of the instrument of ratification of

the United States of America , the Secretary of State of the United

States of America declared that it was intended by the Government of the United States to have these words appear in the English text of the United States original of the treaty, as their equivalent appears

in the Greek text thereof, that their omission from the English text

was an inadvertence and that the United States original of the treaty

and the United States ratified exchange copy of the treaty should be

understood as including those words, the same as if they had been

By the convention concluded between the President of the United

States of America and His Britannic Majesty for the purpose of de-

limiting the boundary between the Philippine archipelago on the one hand and the State of North Borneo which is under British protection

on the other hand, the sovereignty over certain islands which have for many years past been administered by the British North Borneo Com-

pany has been definitely recognized as pertaining to the United States of America. These islands which formed the subject of the arrange-

ment effected by an exchange of notes between His Majesty's Government and the United States Government on July 3rd and July 10th, 1907 , are :-

1. Sibaung, Boaan, Lihiman, Langaan, Great Bakkungaan, Taganak, and Baguan in the group of islands known as the Turtle Islands.
2. The Mangsee Islands .

His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom understand that the Government of the United States of America are prepared to conclude an arrangement in regard to these islands, supplementary to the above-mentioned convention , in the following terms :
FIRSTLY. That the said company be left undisturbed in the administration of the islands in question unless or until the United States Government give notice to His Majesty's Government of their desire that the administration of the islands should be transferred to them. The transfer of administration shall be effected within one

THIRDLY. The United States of America shall not be responsible for the value of any buildings which have been or may be erected or other permanent improvements which have been or may be made in any island the administration of which is subject to transfer but any buildings or improvements erected or made by the administrative

authorities prior to the transfer of administration may be removed provided the interests of the United States of America are not thereby injured. In the event, however, of the Island of Taganak being so transferred, the United States Government will give favourable consideration to the question of the compensation to be paid to the said company in respect of the capital expenditure incurred by the company in connection with the lighthouse situated on the island, and the United States Government will provide for the future maintenance of the lighthouse.
FOURTHLY. That such privilege of administration shall not carry with it territorial rights, such as those of making grants or concessions in the islands in question to extend beyond the temporary occupation of the company ; and any grant, concession, or license made by the company shall cease upon the termination of the company's occupation .
The United States Government, however, take note of the desire of His Majesty's Government that the following titles to land in certain of the islands which were in good faith granted by the Government of North Borneo prior to the arrangement of 1907 , be allowed to stand on the terms on which they were issued by that Government.

A PROCLAMATION

WHEREAS a treaty of arbitration between the United States of ChAirnbai.tration with Preamble.

Contracting Powers. The United States of America

Purpose declared.

and the Republic of China, Determined to prevent so far as

in their power lies any inter-

ruption in the peaceful relations

now happily existing between the two nations ;

Desirous of reaffirming their

adherence to the policy of submitting to impartial decision all justiciable controversies that may arise between them ; and

Eager by their example not only to demonstrate their condemnation of war as an instrument of national policy in their mutual relations, but also to hasten the time when the perfection of international arrangements for the pacific settlement of international disputes shall have eliminated forever the pos-
sibility of war among any of the Powers of the world ;

Les Etats-Unis d'Amérique et
la République de Chine, Résolus à prévenir autant qu'il
est en leur pouvoir toute interruption dans les relations pacifiques heureusement existant entre les deux nations ;
Désireux d'affirmer de nouveau
leur adhésion à la politique consistant à soumettre à une décision impartiale toutes contestations
susceptibles de décisions judiciaires qui viendraient à s'élever entre eux ; et
Soucieux, par leur exemple, non seulement de manifester que, dans leurs relations réciproques , ils condamnent la guerre comme instrument de politique nationale, mais encore de hâter le moment où la conclusion d'accords internationaux pour le règlement pacifique des conflits entre les Etats aura écarté pour toujours les possibilités de guerre entre les nations du monde ;

Acceptance. Control.

ARTICLE 15.
Acceptance of Certificates.
International Load Line Certificates issued under the authority of a Contracting Government shall be accepted by the other Contracting Governments as having the same force as the certificates issued by them to ships belonging to their respective countries.
ARTICLE 16 .
Control.

1. A ship to which this Convention applies, when in a port of a country to which it does not belong, is in any case subject to control with respect to load line as follows : An officer duly authorised by the Government of that country may take such steps as may be necessary for the purpose of seeing that there is on board a valid cerCtearitnifeidc.ate to be as International Load Line Certificate. If there is such a certificate on board the ship, such control shall be limited to the purpose of securing-
(a) that the ship is not loaded beyond the limits allowed by the certificate ;
(b) that the position of the load line on the ship corresponds with the certificate ; and
(c) that the ship has not been so materially altered in respect to the matters dealt with in conditions A and B (set out in paragraph 3 of Article 14 ) that the ship is manifestly unfit to proceed to sea without danger to human life .

2. Only officers possessing the necessary technical qualifications shall be authorised to exercise control as aforesaid , and if such control is exercised under (c) above , it shall only be exercised in so far as may be necessary to secure that the ship shall be made fit to proceed to sea without danger to human life.
3. If control under this Article appears likely to result in legal proceedings being taken against the ship , or in the ship being detained, the Consul of the country to which the ship belongs shall be informed as soon as possible of the circumstances of the case.
ARTICLE 17.
Privileges.
Privileges restricted. The privileges of this Convention may not be claimed in favour of
any ship unless it holds a valid International Load Line Certificate.

ARTICLE 15.
Acceptation des Certificats.
Chaque Gouvernement contractant reconnaîtra aux certificats internationaux de franc-bord délivrés par les autres Gouvernements contractants ou sous leur autorité la même valeur qu'aux certificats délivrés par lui à ses navires nationaux.
ARTICLE 16 .
Contrôle.
1. Tout navire auquel la présente Convention s'applique quand il se trouvera dans un port d'un pays auquel il n'appartient pas sera, en tout cas, et en ce qui concerne les lignes de charge, soumis au contrôle suivant : un fonctionnaire dûment autorisé par le Gouvernement dudit pays pourra prendre les mesures qui peuvent être nécessaires à l'effet de constater qu'il existe à bord un certificat international de franc-bord valable. Si un tel certificat existe à bord, le contrôle consistera seulement à vérifier :
(a) que le navire n'est pas chargé au delà des limites permises par le certificat ;
(b) que la position des lignes de charge sur le navire correspond aux indications portées sur le certificat; et
(c) qu'en ce qui concerne les points visés dans les clauses A et B du paragraphe 3 de l'Article 14, le navire n'a pas subi des modifications d'une importance telle qu'il soit manifestement hors d'état de prendre la mer sans danger pour la vie humaine.
2. Seuls les fonctionnaires qui possèdent la compétence technique nécessaire seront autorisés à exercer le contrôle précité et si ce contrôle est exercé en vertu de l'alinéa (c) ci-dessus, il ne le sera que dans la mesure nécessaire pour s'assurer que le navire sera en état de prendre la mer sans danger pour la vie humaine.
3. Au cas où le contrôle exercé en vertu du présent Article semblerait avoir pour conséquence soit d'entraîner des poursuites légales contre le navire, soit d'interdire son départ , le consul du pays auquel il appartient devra être informé aussitôt que possible des circonstances de l'incident .
ARTICLE 17.
Bénéfice de la Convention.
Le bénéfice de la présente Convention ne peut être réclamé en faveur d'un navire que s'il possède un certificat international de franc-bord non périmé.

Definitions. "Steamer".

Rule I.-Definitions.
Steamer.-The term " steamer " includes all ships having sufficient means for mechanical propulsion, except where provided with sufficient sail area for navigation under sails alone.

Ship with insufficient

sails.

A ship fitted with mechanical means of propulsion and with sail

area insufficient for navigation under sails alone may be assigned a

load line under Part III of these Rules .

Towed lighter, etc. "Sailing ship". Flush deck ship. Superstructure. Freeboard .

A lighter, barge or other ship without independent means of propulsion, when towed , is to be assigned a load line under Part III of these Rules .
Sailing Ship.- The term " sailing ship " includes all ships provided with sufficient sail area for navigation under sails alone, whether or not fitted with mechanical means of propulsion.
Flush Deck Ship.-A flush deck ship is one which has no superstructure on the freeboard deck.
Superstructure. -- A superstructure is a decked structure on the freeboard deck extending from side to side of the ship. A raised quarter deck is considered a superstructure.
-- Freeboard. The freeboard assigned is the distance measured vertically downwards at the side of the ship amidships from the upper edge of the deck line to the upper edge of the load line mark.

Freeboard deck.

Freeboard Deck.-The freeboard deck is the deck from which the freeboard is measured, and is the uppermost complete deck having permanent means of closing all openings in weather portions of the deck in accordance with Rules VIII to XVI. It is the upper deck in flush deck ships and ships with detached superstructures.

In ships having discontinuous freeboard decks within superstructures which are not intact, or which are not fitted with Class 1 closing appliances, the lowest line of the deck below the superstructure deck is taken as the freeboard deck.

the length is measured from the foreside of the stem to the axis of the rudder stock. For ships with cruiser sterns, the length is to be taken as 96 per cent. of the total length on the designed summer load waterline or as the length from the fore side of the stem to the axis of the rudder stock if that be the greater.

Breadth.

Rule XXXIII .-Breadth (B) .
The breadth is the maximum breadth in feet amidships to the moulded line of the frame in iron or steel ships, and to the outside of the planking in wood or composite ships.

Moulded depth .

Rule XXXIV .- Moulded Depth.
The moulded depth is the vertical distance in feet, measured amidships, from the top of the keel to the top of the freeboard deck beam at side. In wood and composite ships the distance is measured from the lower edge of the keel rabbet . Where the form at the lower part of the midship section is of a hollow character, or where thick garboards are fitted, the depth is measured from the point where the line of the flat of the bottom continued inwards cuts the side of the keel.

Rule XXXV.- Depth for Freeboard (D) .

Frame. Frame modulus.

Frame.-For the purpose of the frame modulus , the frame is regarded as composed of a frame angle and a reverse angle each of the same size and thickness .
I Frame Modulus .-- The modulus of the midship frame below the
lowest tier of beams is the moment of inertia I of the frame section
about the neutral axis divided by the distance y measured from the neutral axis to the extremity of the frame section, calculated without deduction for rivet and bolt holes . The modulus is measured in inch units .

s (d- t) (f + f2) ,

The required frame modulus is expressed by

1,000

where-

s is the frame spacing in inches . t is the vertical distance in feet measured at amidships from the top of the keel to a point midway between the top of the inner bottom at side and the top of the heel bracket (see Figure 2) ; where there is no double bottom, t is measured to a point midway between the top of the floor at centre and the top of the floor at side .
f, is a coefficient depending on H, which, in ships fitted with double bottoms , is the vertical distance in feet from the middle of the beam bracket of the lowest tier of beams at side to a point midway between the top of the inner bottom at side and the top of the heel bracket (see Figure 2) . Where there is no double bottom, H is measured to a point midway between the top of the floor at centre and the top of the floor at side. Where the frame obtains additional strength from the form of the ship , due allowance is made in the value of f .

Ante, p. 2210. Ante, p. 2312.

(1 ) Where efficient temporary closing appliances are not provided for the middle line deck openings (see Rule XLV) , or the breadth of opening is 80 per cent. or more of the breadth B , of the superstructure deck at the middle of the opening, the ship is considered as having an open well in way of each opening, and freeing ports are to be provided in way of this well. The effective length of superstructure between openings is governed by Rules XLVII , XLIX, and L.

(2) Where efficient temporary closing appliances are provided for middle line deck openings and the breadth of opening is less than .8 B, the effective length is governed by Rules XLVII, XLIX, and L, except that where access
openings in ' tween deck bulkheads are closed by Class 2 closing appliances, they are regarded as being closed by Class 1 closing appliances in determining the effective length . The total effective length is obtained by adding to the length determined by (1 ) the difference between this length and the length of the ship modified in the ratio of--

Lorsqu'il y a une superstructure fermée avec une ou plusieurs ouvertures axiales dans le pont, non pourvues de moyens de fermeture permanents (voir Règles VIII à XVI) , la longueur effective de la superstructure est déterminée comme il suit :
(1 ) Lorsque des dispositifs de fermeture temporaires efficaces ne sont pas prévus pour les ouvertures axiales dans le pont (voir Règle XLV) ou lorsque la largeur de l'ouverture est égale ou supérieure à 80 pour cent de la largeur B, du pont de superstructures du 68 milieu de l'ouverture, le navire est considéré comme ayant un puits ouvert par le travers de chaque ouverture et des sabords de décharge doivent être prévus par le travers de ce puits. La longueur effective d'une superstructure, entre les ouvertures , est déterminée d'après les Règles XLVII, XLIX et L.
(2) Lorsque des dispositifs de fermeture temporaires efficaces sont prévus pour les ouvertures axiales dans le pont et lorsque la largeur des ouvertures est inférieure à 0,8 B1 , la longueur effective est déterminée d'après les Règles XLVII, XLIX et L; toutefois lorsque les ouvertures d'accès dans les cloisons d'entrepont sont fermées par des dispositifs de fermeture de la classe 2 , elles sont considérées , pour le calcul de la longueur effective, comme étant fermées par des dispositifs de la classe 1 .

measure- The sheer is measured from the deck at side to a line of reference drawn parallel to the keel through the sheer line at amidships.

In ships designed to trim by the stern in service, the sheer may be measured in relation to the load line, provided an additional mark is placed at .25 L forward of amidships, to indicate the assigned load line. This mark is to be similar to the load line disc amidships .

Ante, p. 2294.

In flush deck ships and in ships with detached superstructures the sheer is measured at the freeboard deck.
In ships with topsides of unusual form in which there is a step or break in the topsides, the sheer is considered in relation to the equivalent depth amidships (see Rule XXXV) .
In ships with a superstructure of standard height which extends over the whole length of the freeboard deck, the sheer is measured at the superstructure deck ; where the height exceeds the standard, the sheer may be considered in relation to the standard height.
Where a superstructure is intact or access openings in its enclosing bulkheads are fitted with Class 1 closing appliances, and the superstructure deck has at least the same sheer as the exposed freeboard deck, the sheer of the enclosed portion of the freeboard deck is not taken into account.

Tonture.
Règle LIV.-Généralités.
La tonture est mesurée depuis le pont en abord jusqu'à une ligne de référence tracée parallèlement à la quille au milieu du navire et tangente à la ligne de tonture.
Dans les navires prévus pour naviguer avec un tirant d'eau arrière plus grand que le tirant d'eau avant, la tonture peut être mesurée d'après la ligne de charge à condition qu'une marque additionnelle soit placée à 0,25 L en avant du milieu pour indiquer la ligne de charge assignée. Cette marque doit être semblable au disque de franc-bord au milieu du navire.
Dans les navires à pont découvert et dans les navires à superstructures détachées la tonture est mesurée au pont de franc-bord.
Dans les navires dont les parties hautes des murailles sont d'une forme particulière avec un retrait ou une brisure, la tonture est évaluée d'après le creux équivalent au milieu du navire (voir Règle XXXV) .
Dans les navires ayant une superstructure de hauteur réglementaire, s'étendant sur toute la longueur du pont de franc-bord, la tonture est mesurée au pont de la superstructure. Lorsque la hauteur est supérieure à la hauteur réglementaire la tonture peut être évaluée d'après la hauteur réglementaire. Lorsqu'une superstructure est intacte ou lorsque les ouvertures des cloisons qui la limitent sont munies de fermetures de la classe 1 et lorsque le pont
70 de superstructures a au moins la même tonture que le pont de franc-bord exposé, il n'est pas tenu compte de la tonture dans la partie couverte du pont de franc-bord.

2322 Variations.

INTERNATIONAL LOAD LINE CONVENTION. JULY 5, 1930.
Rule LVI.- Measurement of Variations from Standard Sheer Profile.
Where the sheer profile differs from the standard , the seven ordinates of each profile are multiplied by the appropriate factors given in the table of ordinates. The difference between the sums of the respective products, divided by 18, measures the deficiency or excess of sheer. Where the after half of the sheer profile is greater than the standard and the forward half is less than the standard, no credit is allowed for the part in excess and the deficiency only is measured.

Where the forward half of the sheer profile exceeds the standard, and the after portion of the sheer profile is not less than 75 per cent. of the standard, credit is allowed for the part in excess ; where the after part is less than 50 per cent. of the standard no credit is given for the excess sheer forward. Where the after sheer is between 50 per cent. and 75 per cent. of the standard, intermediate allowances may be granted for excess sheer forward.

Rule LVII.-Correction for Variations from Standard Sheer Profile.

Correction for sheer. The correction for sheer is the deficiency or excess of sheer (see

S

Rule LVI), multiplied by .75 -

where S is the total length of

2L'

superstructure, as defined in Rule XL.

Rule LVIII .-Addition for Deficiency in Sheer.

Addition for defi-

ciency .

Where the sheer is less than the standard, the correction for

deficiency in sheer (see Rule LVII) is added to the freeboard

Deduction for excess.

Rule LIX.-Deduction for Excess Sheer. In flush deck ships and in ships where an enclosed superstructure

covers .1 L before and .1 L abaft amidships, the correction for excess of sheer (see Rule LVII ) is deducted from the freeboard ; in ships with detached superstructures where no enclosed superstructure covers amidships, no deduction is made from the freeboard ; where an enclosed superstructure covers less than .1 L before and .1 L abaft amidships, the deduction is obtained by interpolation . The maximum deduction for excess sheer is 1½ inches at 100 feet and increases
at the rate of 1 ½% inches for each additional 100 feet in the length of the ship .

INTERNATIONAL LOAD LINE CONVENTION. JULY 5 , 1930.

Règle LVI.--Mesure des écarts avec la ligne de tonture réglementaire.
Lorsque la ligne de tonture diffère de la ligne de tonture réglementaire, les sept ordonnées de chacune des 272 lignes sont multipliées par les facteurs correspondants donnés dans la table des ordonnées. La différence entre les sommes des produits respectifs divisée par 18 mesure le manque ou l'excès de tonture. Lorsque la moitié arrière de la ligne de tonture est plus haute que la ligne de tonture réglementaire et lorsque la moitié avant est moins haute que cette ligne de tonture réglementaire aucune amélioration de franc-bord n'est accordée pour la partie la plus haute et la diminution correspondant à la partie basse est seule mesurée .
Lorsque la moitié avant de la ligne de tonture est plus haute que la ligne de tonture réglementaire et lorsque la partie arrière de la tonture n'est pas moindre que 75 pour cent de la tonture réglementaire, on doit tenir compte de la partie en excédent. Lorsque la partie arrière a une tonture moindre que 50 pour cent de la valeur de la tonture réglementaire , on ne doit pas tenir compte de l'excès de tonture à l'avant. Lorsque la tonture à l'arrière est comprise entre 50 et 75 pour cent de la tonture réglementaire, une correction intermédiaire peut être donnée pour excès de tonture à l'avant.

Règle LVII .-Correction pour les écarts avec la ligne de tonture réglementaire.

La correction pour la tonture est égale au manque ou à l'excès

Règle LVIII .- Addition pour manque de tonture.

Lorsque la tonture est moindre que la tonture réglementaire, la correction pour manque de tonture (voir Règle LVII) est ajoutée au franc-bord.

Règle LIX.-Déduction pour excès de tonture.
Dans les navires à pont découvert et dans ceux dont la superstructure fermée couvre 0,1 L sur l'avant et 0,1 L sur l'arrière du milieu du navire, la correction pour excès de tonture (voir Règle LVII) est déduite du franc-bord ; dans les navires à superstructures détachées où aucune superstructure fermée ne couvre le milieu du navire, aucune déduction n'est faite du franc-bord ; lorsqu'une superstructure fermée couvre moins de 0,1 L sur l'avant et de 0,1 L sur l'arrière du milieu du navire, la déduction est obtenue par interpolation .
La déduction maximum pour excès de tonture est de 38 millimètres à 30 mètres 50 et augmente à raison de 38 millimètres pour chaque augmentation de 30 m. 50 de la longueur du navire.

Rule LXVI .-Fresh Water Freeboard.
The minimum freeboard in fresh water of unit density is the freeboard obtained by deducting from the minimum freeboard in salt
water 40 T inches, where 40
A = displacement in salt water in tons at the Summer load waterline, and
T - tons per inch immersion in salt water at the Summer load water-line.

Where the displacement at the Summer load water-line cannot be certified , the deduction is to be 4 inch per foot of Summer draught, measured from the top of the keel to the centre of the disc .

Ships in the same manner as the freeboards for steamers are com-

puted from the Freeboard Table for Steamers, except as follows :-

Depth . Ante, p. 2294.

Rule LXXI .- Depth for Freeboard (D) .
In sailing ships having a greater rate of rise of floor than 1 ½% inches per foot, the vertical distance from the top of keel (Rule XXXIV) , is reduced by half the difference between the total rise of floor at the half-breadth of the ship and the total rise at 1 ½% inches per foot. 2½ inches per foot of half-breadth is the maximum rate of rise for which a deduction is made.

Where the form at the lower part of the midship section is of a hollow character, or thick garboards are fitted, the depth is measured

from the point where the line of the flat of the bottom continued inwards cuts the side of the keel.

The depth used with the Freeboard Table is to be taken as not L
less than 12

Coefficient of fineness.

Rule LXXII.- Coefficient offineness (c) .

The coefficient used with the Freeboard Table is to be taken as not less than .62 and not greater than .72.

practicable and reasonable, be framed in accordance with the principles and rules laid down in this Convention, and should whenever possible be made after consultation and agreement with the Governments of the other countries concerned in such international voyages.

Strength. Standards ofstrength.
As under the Rules attached to this Convention, ships which comply with the highest standard laid down in the rules of a classifi-
cation society recognised by the Administration are regarded as having sufficient strength for the minimum freeboards allowed under the rules, the Conference recommends that each Administration
should request the Society or Societies which it has recognised to confer from time to time with the Societies recognised by other Administrations, with a view to securing as much uniformity as possible in the application of the standards of strength on which freeboard is based .

Surveys. Ante, p. 2248.

Annual Surveys.

des voyages internationaux soient, autant qu'il est possible et raisonnable de le faire, établies conformément aux principes et aux règles fixées dans la Convention et, si possible, après avoir consulté les Gouvernements des autres pays intéressés dans ces voyages internationaux et obtenu leur accord.
Solidité.
Suivant les règles annexées à la présente Convention, les navires qui satisfont aux " Standards " les plus élevés établis dans les règles d'une Société de Classification reconnue par l'Administration sont considérés comme ayant une solidité suffisante pour obtenir le franc-bord minimum qui peut être accordé d'après ces Règles . La Conférence recommande que chaque Administration demande à la Société ou aux Sociétés qu'elle a reconnues de conférer de temps en temps avec les Sociétés reconnues par les autres Administrations , afin de réaliser une uniformité aussi grande que possible dans l'application des " Standards " de solidité sur lesquels le franc-bord est basé.
Visites annuelles.
La Conférence recommande que , si possible , chaque Administration prenne ses dispositions pour assurer que la visite périodique, indiquée dans le paragraphe 3 ° (c) de l'Article 14 , ait lieu à des intervalles d'environ douze mois en ce qui concerne la tenue en bon état des installations et des appareils visés dans la clause B du paragraphe 3 de cet Article (c'est-à-dire : les installations et les appareils pour (i ) la protection des ouvertures , (ii) les garde-corps , (iii) les sabords de décharge, (iv) les moyens d'accès aux logements de l'équipage) .

No. 48

BRITISH EMBASSY,

SIR,

Washington, D.C. , February 8th, 1932

I have the honour to refer to my note No. 183 of May 29th, 1931¹ regarding the International Load Line Convention of 1930 and, under instructions from His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, to transmit to you herewith copies of a proposal made by the Netherlands Government relating to modifications in the text of the Rules in Annex I to the Convention. The proposal is transmitted for the information of the United States Government in

preparing the regulations necessary to give effect to the Convention . I am to state that His Majesty's Government in the United King-
dom are entirely in agreement with the proposed modifications , which they consider represent the most practical way of simplifying the application of the rules in those countries in which metric measures are in use, but they do not consider that the proposal necessitates any amendment of the Convention.
I have the honour to be, with the highest consideration, Sir, Your most obedient , humble servant, R. C. LINDSAY.
THE HONOURABLE HENRY L. STIMSON,

Secretary of State of the United States, Washington, D.C.

The results from the proposed tables are practically the same as those of the present, the differences being negligible . In the case of the freeboard tables, they never are more than 2,5 millimètres, or onetenth of an inch; this maximum only is attained in a few cases .
As to the height of coamings, &c . , it should be kept in mind that in any case both the English and the French text are in force, and, therefore, it will not be possible that any surveyor will make difficulties either when a ship that has been constructed in a country where the English measures are applied does not comply, as to some measures, which should be slightly larger, according to the French text or alternatively.
Finally, it is proposed to draw up the freeboards on the certificates when in metric measures in mètres with two decimals , e.g.:-

"Tropicale . "Eté .
" Hiver... "Hiver dans
nord ..

(a) 0,13 mètre au-dessus de (b) . (b) 1,92 mètres .
Arête supérieure de la ligne passant par le centre du disque.
(c) 0,13 mètre au-dessous de (b) . l'Atlantique
(d) 0,18 mètre au-dessous de (b) ."

Such is simpler than and preferable to a freeboard mentioned on the certificate in millimètres.

The Secretary of State (Stimson) to the British Ambassador (Lindsay)

DEPARTMENT OF STATE,

EXCELLENCY :

Washington, June 1 , 1932.

Consideration has been given to the proposal enclosed with your

note No. 48 of February 8 , 1932 , made by the Netherlands Govern-

ment relating to modifications in the French text of certain of the

rules in Annex 1 to the International Load Line Convention of 1930 ,

and I am now enabled to inform you that as the proposed modifica-

tions in no way alter the English text of the convention or affect the

equivalence of the French text with the English text, this Government is in agreement with His Majesty's Government in the United

Kingdom that the modifications represent the most practical way of simplifying the application of the rules in those countries in which metric measures are in use, and that the proposal does not necessitate any amendment of the convention.

Attention is invited, however, to a typographical error found in

the third table of Regulation XXXVII in the Netherland proposal where the factor f corresponding to a value of K of 4,5 meters should be changed from 3134 to read 4134 .

Accept, Excellency, the renewed assurances of my highest con-

sideration .

For the Secretary of State :

HIS EXCELLENCY

The Secretary of State presents his compliments to the British Chargé d'Affaires ad interim, and referring to the Ambassador's note No. 215 of June 28, 1932, transmitting copies of a sheet showing corrections which the Netherland Government has made to the figures contained in its proposal transmitted with the Ambassador's note No. 48 of February 8 , 1932 , relating to modifications in the French text of the rules in Annex I to the London Load Line Convention of 1930, informs him that these modifications have had the consideration of the appropriate Departments of the Government of the United States and that no objection to them is perceived.
The Secretary of State would be thankful if he might be informed from time to time in regard to the other countries which accept the corrections proposed by the Netherland Government.
The Secretary of State would be further obliged if he might be informed of the procedure His Majesty's Government in Great Britain will take in respect of such corrections in the French text of the convention and rules, as have been or may be agreed upon in order to bring that text more in accord with the English text. It would be especially desirable to know whether it is the intention of the British Government to furnish to the governments certified copies of the convention and rules as so modified .
In this relation it is recalled that attached to the certified ccpy of the convention and rules originally furnished by the British Government is a long list of errata in the French text. The procedure of the governments in proclaiming or promulgating the convention and rules would be greatly facilitated and simplified if corrected certified copies could be furnished to them .

British Ambassador.

No. 313

His Majesty's Minister presents his compliments to the Secretary of State and with reference to his note 581.61 B 1/224 of August 9th last relative to the International Load Line Convention, has the honour, under instructions from His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, to inform him that Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, France, Greece, Italy, Poland, the Free City of Danzig, Spain, and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics , have expressed their willingness to accept the proposals of the Netherlands Government in connection with the French text of the Rules in Annex 1 to that Convention.
Mr. Osborne is also instructed to inform Mr. Stimson that, since the errors found in the original text of the Convention and Rules were all of minor importance, and as the modifications in the French text recently proposed by the Netherlands Government represent merely the most practical way of simplifying the application of the Rules in Annex 1 to the Convention in those countries in which metric measures are in use, the competant authorities do not propose to arrange for the circulation of certified corrected copies of the Convention and Rules . In this connection, he is to add that the errors which were found to exist in the English text of the Convention and to which attention was called at the time of the circulation of certified copies, were corrected in the copy of the Convention which was scheduled to the Merchant Shipping (Safety and Load Line Conventions) Act of 1932 .

Værdiangivelse .
Paa Pakker kan angives Værdi indtil et Beløb af 500 Guldfrancs eller det hertil i Afsendelseslandets Mønt svarende Beløb . Poststyrelserne i de to kontraherende Lande kan dog efter fælles Overenskomst forhøje eller nedsætte dette Maksimum for Værdiangivelse .

Med Undtagelse af de i næste Punkt nævnte Tilfælde er Poststyrelserne ansvarlige for Bortkomst af Pakker med angiven Værdi , der er indleveret i det ene af de kontraherende Lande og bestemt til Udlevering i det andet, og for Bortkomst, Berøvelse eller Beskadigelse af Pakkernes Indhold , helt eller delvist .
Afsenderen eller en anden dertil legitimeret Person er som Følge heraf berettiget til en Erstatning, der svarer til Bortkomstens , Indholdsberøvelsens eller Beskadigelsens virkelige Beløb . Erstatningsbeløbet beregnes paa Grundlag af den virkelige Værdi (Fakturapris eller, hvis en saadan ikke opgives, almindelig Vurderingspris) paa det Tidspunkt og det Sted, hvor Pakken indleveredes, dog med det Forbehold, at Erstatningen ikke i noget Tilfælde kan overstige den paa Pakken angivne Værdi , for hvilken Værdigebyr er betalt, og højst kan udgøre 500 Guldfrancs .
I Tilfælde, hvor der skal betales Erstatning for en bortkommen Pakke eller for Ødelæggelse eller Berøvelse af hele dens Indhold , er Afsenderen, saafremt han fremsætter Begæring derom , berettiget til at faa Portoen tilbagebetalt. Værdigebyret tilbagebetales dog ikke i noget Tilfælde .

Naar en Pakke med angiven Værdi, der er indleveret i det ene Land og bestemt til Udlevering i det andet Land, omadresseres fra sidstnævnte Land til et tredie Land eller tilbagesendes til et tredie Land paa Afsenderens eller Adressatens Begæring, kan den, der er berettiget til Erstatning, i Tilfælde af Bortkomst, Indholdsberøvelse eller Beskadigelse, som er sket efter Omekspeditionen eller Tilbagesendelsen fra det oprindelige Bestemmelsesland, i saadanne Tilfælde kun kræve den Erstatning, som det Land, i hvilket Bortkomsten , Indholdsberøvelsen eller Beskadigelsen er sket, indvilliger i at yde, eller som dette Land er forpligtet til at yde i Overensstemmelse med den mellem de i Omekspeditionen eller Tilbagesendelsen direkte interesserede Lande bestaaende Overenskomst. Hvert af denne Overneskomsts to Signatarlande, som ved en Fejl videresender en Pakke med angiven Værdi til et tredie Land, er ansvarlig overfor Afsenderen i samme Udstrækning som Afsendelseslandet, d. v. s. inden for de i nærværende Overenskomst fastsatte Grænser.

Almindelige Pakker, der er fejlsendt, videresendes til det rigtige Bestemmelsessted ad den korteste Rute, der staar til det videresendende Postvæsens Disposition. De maa ikke af dette Postvæsen belastes med Toldafgifter eller andre Afgifter. Pakker med angiven

Værdi, der er fejlsendt, maa videresendes til deres Bestemmelsessted

som Værdipakker. Hvis dette er umuligt, skal de tilbagesendes til Afsendelseslandet .

Naar Videresendelsen medfører Tilbagesendelse til Afsendelseslandet, refunderer det videresendende Postvæsen Afsendelseslandets Postvæsen de modtagne Portoandele og giver Meddelelse om Fejlen

ved Tilbagemeldelse . Naar Videresendelsen medfører Forsendelse af en Pakke til et

tredie Land, og det Portobeløb, der er godskrevet det videresendende Postvæsen, er utilstrækkeligt til at dække Udgifterne ved Videresendelsen, som det skal bestride, erholder det videresendende Post-

væsen Dækning for det manglende Beløb ved at kræve det hos det

Udvekslingskontor, fra hvilket den fejlsendte Pakke modtoges direkte. Grundlaget for Kravet meddeles det nævnte Kontor ved

Tilbagemeldelse .

For Pakker, som omekspederes indenfor Bestemmelseslandets Territorium, kan Poststyrelsen i dette Land opkræve de Tillægstakster, som maatte være fastsat i dens indenrigske Bestemmelser . Disse Takster ophæves ikke, selv om Pakken tilbagesendes til Afsendelseslandet eller videresendes til et andet Land .
2. En Pakke kan kun efter Afsenderens eller Adressatens Begæring omekspederes udover det oprindelige Bestemmelseslands Territorium og kun under den Forudsætning, at Pakken opfylder de for dens videre Befordring gældende Betingelser. Pakker med angiven Værdi maa kun omekspederes til et andet Land som Værdipakker.
Ny Porto og, for Pakker med angiven Værdi, ny Værdiporto kan, hvis Forudbetaling ikke sker, opkræves ved Udleveringen.
Afsenderen er berettiget til ved Forholdsordre paa Adressekortet og Pakken at forbyde Omekspedition .

ARTICLE 2 .

Preparation of Parcels.

Preparation of parcels.

1. The name and address of the sender and of the addressee must

be legibly and correctly written in every case when possible on the

parcel itself or on a label or tag firmly attached thereto . It is not

allowed to write with initials the name and address of the sender or

addressee , unless the initials are the adopted trade name of the

senders or addressees which is generally understood . Addresses in

pencil are also not allowed , except those written with copying ink on

a surface previously dampened . A slip bearing the name and address of the sender and addressee
must be enclosed in the parcel when the address is written on a label or tag which is not gummed to the parcel . It is advisable that such slips be enclosed in all parcels .

2. Every parcel must be packed in a manner adequate for the

length of the journey and the character of the contents, and in such a

way as to prevent the contents from damaging other parcels or objects or injuring the postal agents. The packing must protect the con-

tents sufficiently that, in case of rifling, the traces thereof may be easily discovered .

No packing is required for ordinary parcels consisting of a single article, such as pieces of wood , metal, etc. , which are not usually packed by the trade .
Any liquid or any substance which easily liquefies must be packed in a double receptacle. Between the first receptacle (bottle, flask, pot, box, etc. ) and the second (box of metal, of strong wood , of strong corrugated cardboard or of strong fiberboard or receptacle of equal strength) shall be left a space which shall be filled with sawdust, bran or some other absorbent material, in sufficient quantity to absorb all the liquid contents in the case of breakage.
Powders and dyes in powder form must be packed in lead-sealed metal containers which must be enclosed in substantial outer covers , so as to obviate all damage to the accompanying mail matter.
3. Insured parcels must be sealed by means of wax, by lead or other seals. Ordinary parcels may be sealed at the option of the sender, or careful tying is sufficient as a mode of closing. Either Administration may require a special design or mark of the sender in the sealing of insured parcels mailed in its service, as a means of protection .
The customs of the country of destination, for the purpose of customs examination , shall have the right to break the seals . After customs examination is concluded , the parcels shall be officially resealed .
4. On the address side, each insured parcel must bear a label with the words " Insured " or " Valeur déclarée ", or be stamped or marked with the same words in close proximity to the number given the parcel, and it must also bear an indication of the amount of the insured value, mentioned fully and legibly in the currency of the country of origin and in Roman letters. This amount must be converted into gold francs by the sender or by the office of origin and the result of conversion is added below the original description . The amount of the insured value must also be indicated on the customs declaration.
5. The seals , as well as any kind of labels or stamps, affixed to insured parcels, must be so placed as not to hide injuries to the package. Moreover, the labels or stamps must not be folded over two sides of the package so as to cover the edge.

December 9, 1932. PARCEL POST AGREEMENT-DENMARK . December 28, 1932.
ARTIKEL 2.
Pakkernes Beskaffenhed .
1. Afsenderens og Adressatens Navn og Adresse skal skrives tydeligt i videst muligt Omfang paa selve Pakken eller paa en Seddel eller et Mærke, der er solidt fæstet til Pakken . Det er ikke tilladt at angive Afsenderens eller Adressatens Navn og Adresse ved Initialer, med mindre Initialerne er Afsenderens eller Adressatens indregistrerede Firmabetegnelse. Adresseangivelser, der er anført med Blyant, er heller ikke tilladt, medmindre der er anvendt Blækstift og Stedet for Anbringelsen forud er fugtet.
En Seddel, der bærer Angivelse af Afsenderens og Adressatens Adresser, skal indlægges i Pakken, naar dennes Adresse er skrevet paa en Seddel eller et Mærke , der ikke er klæbet paa Pakken . Det tilraades iøvrigt at indlægge saadanne Sedler i alle Pakker.
2. Enhver Pakke skal være indpakket paa en under Hensyn til Befordringens Længde og Indholdets Beskaffenhed forsvarlig Maade og saaledes , at Indholdet ikke kan foraarsage Skade paa andre Pakker eller Genstande eller medføre Ulemper for Posttjenestemændene . Indpakningen maa være tilstrækkelig til Beskyttelse af Indholdet , saaledes at der i Tilfælde af Indholdsberøvelse let kan konstateres Spor heraf.
Der kræves ikke Indpakning for almindelige Pakker, der kun bestaar af en enkelt Genstand, f. Eks. et Stykke Træ, Metal o . s . v. , som det er Handelssædvane ikke at indpakke.
Alle Vædsker eller Stoffer, der let bliver flydende , skal indesluttes i dobbelte Beholdere . Imellem den indre Beholder (Flaske , Dunk, Kasse o. s. v. ) og den ydre (Kasse af Metal, stærkt Træ, stærkt Bølgepap eller stærkt Fibermateriale eller en Beholder af tilsvarende Styrke) skal der være et Mellemrum, som skal udfyldes med Savsmuld, Klid eller andet absorberende Stof i en saadan Mængde, at det Tilfælde af Lækage er tilstrækkeligt til at absorbere hele det flydende Indhold .
Pulver og Farve i Pulverform skal indesluttes i Metalbeholdere , der tilloddes og derefter indpakkes i stærkt ydre Materiale, saaledes at al Beskadigelse af andre Postforsendelser derved forebygges .
3. Pakker med angiven Værdi skal forsegles med Benyttelse af Lak, Bly eller andet Materiale . Det staar Afsenderen frit for at forsegle almindelige Pakker, men omhyggelig Omsnøring er tilstrækkeligt Lukke. Hver af Poststyrelserne kan af Beskyttelseshensyn kræve, at Afsenderen til Forsegling af Pakker med angiven Værdi skal benytte et Signet med særligt Tegn eller Mærke.
Toldmyndighederne i Bestemmelseslandet har ved Toldundersøgelsen Ret til at bryde Seglene . Efter Toldbehandlingens Afslutning skal Pakkerne forsegles paany med Tjenestesegl .
4. Alle Pakker med angiven Værdi skal paa Adressesiden bære en Etiket med Ordene " Angiven Værdi " eller " Valeur déclarée " eller stemples eller mærkes med samme Angivelse i umiddelbar Nærhed af Registernummeret. De maa ligeledes bære Angivelse af Værdiangivelsens Beløb anført tydeligt i Afsendelseslandets Mønt og gentaget helt ud med latinske Bogstaver. Dette Beløb skal af Afsenderen eller Afsendelsesposthuset omsættes til Guldfrancs, og Francsbeløbet tilføjes neden under den oprindelige Værdiangivelse . Værdiangivelsens Beløb skal ligeledes angives i Tolddeklarationen .
5. Segl og alle Etiketter og Mærker paa Pakker med angiven Værdi skal anbringes saaledes, at de ikke skjuler Beskadigelser af Indpakning. Endvidere maa Etiketter eller Mærker ikke bøjes over to Sider af Pakken, saaledes at Kanten dækkes .

The customs declaration shall give a general description of the parcel, an accurate statement in detail of its contents and value, date of mailing, actual weight, the sender's name and address, and the name and address of the addressee, and shall be securely attached to the parcel. However, as an exception to the foregoing, when more than one parcel is mailed simultaneously by the same sender in one country to the same addressee at the same address in the other country, the sender need prepare only one customs declaration for the entire shipment, which customs declaration shall show, in addition to the particulars set forth in the preceding sentence, the total number of parcels comprising the shipment, and shall be securely attached to one of the parcels. The parcels comprising the entire shipment shall be clearly marked in such case with a fractional number, the numerator of which will indicate, in Arabic figures, the number of the parcel, and the denominator the number of parcels comprising the shipment ; for example, if a single shipment were composed of 15 parcels, each parcel would be numbered , respectively, 1/15, 2/15 , 3/15, etc.
2. The Administrations accept no responsibility for the correctness of the customs declarations.

Return receipts.

ARTICLE 4 .
Return receipts.
1. As to a parcel for which a return receipt is asked, the office of origin impresses on the parcel the letters or words " A. R." or " Avis de Réception ". The office of origin or any other office appointed by the dispatching Administration shall fill out a return receipt form and attach it to the parcel. If the form does not reach the office of destination, that office makes out a duplicate.

Receptacles.

2. The office of destination, after having duly filled out the return receipt form , returns it free of postage to the address of the sender of the parcel.
3. When the sender applies for a return receipt after a parcel has been posted, the office of origin duly fills out a return receipt form and attaches it to a form of inquiry which is entered with the details concerning the transmission of the parcel and then forwards it to the office of destination of the parcel. In the case of the due delivery of the parcel, the office of destination withdraws the inquiry form, and the return receipt is treated in the manner prescribed in the foregoing paragraph .
ARTICLE 5.

Efter rigtigt at have udfyldt Modtagelsesbevisformularen tilbagesender Bestemmelseskontoret den portofrit til Afsenderen af Pakken . 3. Naar Afsenderen fremsætter Begæring om Modtagelsesbevis efter at en Pakke er indleveret, udfylder Afsendelseskontoret en Modtagelsesbevisformular i Forbindelse med en Efterspørgselsblanket, i hvilken de nødvendige Oplysninger om Pakken gives, og fremsender derefter Formularerne til Pakkens Bestemmelseskontor. I Tilfælde af, at Pakken er rigtigt udleveret, tilbageholder Bestemmelseskontoret Efterspørgselsblanketten og behandler Modtagelsesbeviset paa den i foregaaende Punkt foreskrevne Maade.
ARTIKEL 5.

NATIONAL FIRE PREVENTION WEEK- 1931 BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

A PROCLAMATION

National Fire vention Week.
Preamble.

PreIt has become customary for the President of the United States to
request an annual observance of Fire Prevention Week throughout the nation to stimulate the interest and cooperation of officials ,
organizations , and citizens in diminishing the losses of life and property from fire.
Last year fires in the United States caused a direct property loss

estimated at nearly $ 500,000,000 , an increase of $40,000,000 over 1929. These direct losses affected home owners, farmers , business men,

and workingmen. There were many more millions of indirect losses
in rentals, broken contracts , unemployment, and interruption to business .

Deaths and injuries to men , women, and children exceeded 35,000 in 1930. The majority of the losses of life and property were the result of carelessness and lack of preventive measures.

The purpose of National Fire Prevention Week is to focus attention
on the hazards of fire and to promote preventive measures to reduce this devasting waste . Week of October 4, Now, THEREFORE, I , HERBERT HOOVER, President of the United 1931, designated as. States of America, do hereby proclaim the week of October 4 , 1931 ,
to be observed as Fire Prevention Week and earnestly solicit the assistance of each citizen to help lessen the loss and needless waste and suffering from fires which are largely preventable.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed .

DONE at the City of Washington this 5" day of August, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and thirty-one , and of
[SEAL] the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and fifty-sixth . HERBERT HOOVER

CONSERVATION OF OUR WATERFOWL BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
A PROCLAMATION

August 25, 1931.

The long-continued and severe drought of the past two years has inflicted not only economic hardships by seriously curtailing crop and stock production, but also has resulted in an emergency condition as regards the present and future safety and abundance of the waterfowl of the continent. In large areas of the United States and Canada , through lack of the water on breeding grounds essential to rearing the young birds, the drought has entailed widespread destruction among the former hordes of the wild fowl that migrate to our several States.

day of thanksgiving . Our country has cause for gratitude to the Almighty. We have
been widely blessed with abundant harvests . We have been spared from pestilence and calamities . Our institutions have served the

people. Knowledge has multiplied and our lives are enriched with its application. Education has advanced , the health of our people has increased. We have dwelt in peace with all men . The measure

of passing adversity which has come upon us should deepen the spir-

itual life of the people , quicken their sympathies and spirit of sacrifice for others , and strengthen their courage. Many of our neighbors are in need from causes beyond their control and the compassion of

the people throughout the nation should so assure their security over

this winter that they too may have full cause to participate in this

waste of approximately half a billion dollars caused each year by fires should be scrupulously avoided. The American per capita loss now is nearly double that of 20 years ago and constitutes a challenge to our efforts that no citizen can afford to ignore. It is a drain on our created
resources which we should strive to eliminate, as it is largely preventable.
The observance of National Fire Prevention Week should serve to arouse the attention and stimulate the action of all citizens in

preventing fire waste .

Now therefore I do recommend and assign Thursday the 26th day of November next to be devoted by the People of these States to the service of that great and glorious Being, who is the beneficent Author of all the good that was, that is, or that will be-That we may then all unite in rendering unto him our sincere and humble thanks--for his kind care and protection of the People of this country previous to their becoming a Nation-for the signal and manifold mercies, and the favorable interpositions of his providence, which we experienced in the course and conclusion of the late war-for the great degree of tranquillity, union, and plenty, which we have since enjoyed-for the peaceable and rational manner in which we have been enabled to establish constitutions of government for our safety and happiness, and particularly the national One now lately instituted-for the civil and religious liberty with which we are blessed , and the means we have of acquiring and diffusing useful knowledge ; and in general for all the great and various favors which he hath been pleased to confer upon us.
And also that we may then unite in most humbly offering our prayers and supplications to the great Lord and Ruler of Nations and beseech him to pardon our national and other transgressions- to enable us all , whether in public or private stations, to perform our several and relative duties properly and punctually-to render our national government a blessing to all the People, by constantly being a government of wise, just, and constitutional laws, discreetly and faithfully executed and obeyed- to protect and guide all Sovereigns and Nations (especially such as have shewn kindness unto us) and to bless them with good government, peace, and concord-To promote the knowledge and practice of true religion and virtue, and the encrease of science among them and Us- and generally to grant unto all mankind such a degree of temporal prosperity as he alone knows to be best.

ANNOUNCING THE DEATH OF THE HONORABLE CALVIN COOLIDGE BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

A PROCLAMATION

TO THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES :

Announcing death of ex-President Calvin

It becomes my sad duty to announce officially the death of Calvin

Coolidge.

Coolidge, which occurred at his home in the City of Northampton,

Massachusetts, on the fifth day of January, nineteen hundred and

thirty-three, at twelve twenty-five o'clock in the afternoon.

Mr. Coolidge had devoted his entire life to the public service, and

his steady progress from Councilman to Mayor of Northampton and thence upward as Member of the State Senate of Massachusetts , Lieutenant-Governor and Governor of Massachusetts, to VicePresident and President of the United States, stands as a conspicuous

memorial to his private and public virtues, his outstanding ability, and his devotion to the public welfare.
His name had become in his own lifetime a synonym for sagacity
and wisdom ; and his temperateness in speech and his orderly deliberation in action bespoke the profound sense of responsibility which guided his conduct of the public business.
From the American people he evoked an extraordinary warmth of
affectionate response to his salient and characteristic personality. He earned and enjoyed their confidence in the highest degree . To millions of our people his death will come as a personal sorrow as
well as a public loss. Suitable militaryand naval honors directed. As an expression of the public sorrow, it is ordered that the flags
of The White House and of the several departmental buildings be

displayed at half staff for a period of thirty days, and that suitable military and naval honors under orders of the Secretary of War and the Secretary of the Navy may be rendered on the day of the funeral.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed .

DONE at the City of Washington this fifth day of January, in the

year of our Lord nineteen hundred and thirty-three, and of

mented under the laws of a foreign country which grants an equivalent exemption to citizens of the United States and to corporations organized in the United States shall be exempt from income tax,

may hereafter accord to the commerce of Cuba or of any of the territories or possessions of the United States or the Panama Canal Zone or the treatment, which is or may hereafter be accorded to the commerce of the United States with any of its territorial boundaries or possessions or to the commerce of its territories or possessions with one another.

MR . SECRETARY :

WASHINGTON, April 16, 1930.

I have the honor to refer to Your Excellency's kind note of the 5th instant relative to the exemption from taxation in the United States

on revenue derived from operations of Spanish vessels, giving me a transcript of the communication which had been received in the

matter from the Treasury Department, points of which were quoted thereunder .

It is a satisfaction for me to be able to express to Your Excellency the pleasure with which I have seen that the recent statements of

the Spanish Minister of Finance, expressed in my note of February 11 , 1930 , accord with the proposals which the American Secretary

of the Treasury was good enough to make in the letter of August 2, 1929 which he addressed to the Compañía Trasatlántica , through my intermediary.

In view of the foregoing, I request Your Excellency to be so good as to give the appropriate instructions to the corresponding authorities in order that they may take into account this decision with respect to the Spanish Shipping Companies in the sense that the

profits of Spanish citizens which consist exclusively in earnings derived from vessels documented in Spain shall be exempt from taxation in the United States by the laws of this country, and particularly with

respect to that set forth by Your Excellency in your note of September 26, 1929 , regarding the case of the Compañía Trasatlántica.
As soon as I received the above-mentioned note of the 5th of the

current month of April from Your Excellency, I hastened to transmit the correspondence in copy to the Ministry of State at Madrid, and while I await a reply, it is my pleasing duty to express to Your

Excellency my gratitude for the good will which from the beginning I have been able to value, both in the Treasury Department and in

the Department under Your Excellency's worthy direction, to arrive at a favorable solution of this matter, which cannot do less than

strengthen the good relations existing between our two countries.

I have the honor to refer to previous correspondence concerning SAtagtreese. ment by United the desire of Spanish nationals to be exempted from income taxation in this country on revenue derived from the operation of Spanish ships and to inform you that a communication in the matter has been received from the Treasury Department, the pertinent portions of which are quoted hereunder :
"Under date of March 31 , 1930 , this office expressed the opinion 43V, pol. 2. 6492; , Vpo.l.24349,;pV.o2l5;. that Spain meets the reciprocal exemption provisions of the Revenue Vol. 45, p. 847. Acts of 1921 , 1924 , and 1926 , and stated that accordingly the income of Spanish nationals which consists exclusively of earnings derived

2586

DOUBLE INCOME TAX-SHIPPING PROFITS-SPAIN.

from operation of ships documented under the laws of Spain would

be exempted from taxation by the United States under those Acts.

It was further stated that inasmuch as sections 212 (b) and 231 (b)

of the Revenue Act of 1928, relating to exemption of the income of nonresident aliens and foreign corporations, are substantially the

same as section 213 (b ) ( 8 ) of the Revenue Acts of 1921 , 1924 , and

1926, the exemption would be extended to the taxable years governed by the Revenue Act of 1928.

" In order to put the arrangement into effect this Department,

under date of April 25, 1930 , issued Treasury Decision 4289 which

amended article 89 of Regulations 62 , 65, and 69 , and article 1042 of

Regulations 74 , pertaining to the reciprocal exemption from income

tax of earnings derived by nonresident aliens and foreign corporations

from the operation of ships documented under the laws of foreign countries. The effect of that Treasury decision is to include Spain

in the list of countries which exempt from tax so much of the income of citizens of the United States nonresident in such foreign countries

and of corporations organized in the United States as consists of

earnings derived from the operation of a ship or ships documented

under the laws of the United States, and to exclude Spain from the list of countries which do not grant such exemption.

"In addition to the formal Treasury decision issued by this Depart-

ment the Collector of Internal Revenue, Customhouse, New York, New York, was specifically advised under date of April 23 , 1930 , as to the ruling contained in the letter from this Department addressed to your Department under date of March 31 , 1930, and was informed that the Compania Transatlantica (Spanish Royal Mail Line) would not be held liable for income tax on income which consists exclusively of earnings derived from the operation of ships documented under the laws of Spain for the taxable years arising under the Revenue Acts of 1921 , 1924, 1926 , and 1928."

WASHINGTON, August 11 , 1924.

Referring to the Embassy's note No. 138 of February 11 , 1924 , onDoshuibplpeinginprcoofmites. tax and to previous correspondence relating to a proposed arrangement tioRne,ciUpnrioctaeld eSxteamteps-, between the Internal Revenue authorities of the United States and Great Britain and Great Britain with a view to granting relief from double income Northern Ireland .

taxation in cases where the profits arising from the business of shipping are chargeable to both British income tax and to income

tax payable in the United States, I have the honor to inform you of the receipt of a letter on the subject from the Secretary of the Treasury.
It appears therefrom that Section 213 (b) (8 ) of the Revenue ActV43o, pl. .26492;,Vopl. .24349,;pV.o2l5.; of 1921 which has been reenacted as Section 213 (b) ( 8 ) of the Rev- Vol. 45, pp. 847, 849. enue Act of 1924 exempts from tax so much of the income of a nonresident alien or foreign corporation as is derived from the operation of a ship or ships documented under the laws of a foreign country if that foreign country in turn exempts from tax so much of the income of a citizen of the United States nonresident in such

country and of a corporation organized in the United States as is derived from the operation of a ship or ships documented under the laws of the United States. The question of the exemption from tax of income derived from the operation of British vessels has, as the Embassy has observed , previously been discussed by officials of the Treasury Department with Sir Percy Thompson, Deputy Chairman of the British Board of Inland Revenue, who came to the United States for that purpose. I am informed that these discussions proved fruitless because Sir Percy Thompson did not feel at liberty to recede from the British position that the taxability of a corporation as a resident of the United Kingdom should depend not upon

the place of incorporation but upon the place " where its real business is carried on and that * * * is carried on where the control and

management of the company abide ". (American Thread Company v. Joyce, 6 T.C. , 163 , 164. )
The navigation laws of the United States require that a corporation owning a vessel of the United States be a corporation organized in the United States and that its president and managing directors be citizens of the United States, but there is no requirement that the president and managing directors be residents of this country . It was conceivable therefore that the president and managing directors might reside in the United Kingdom, hold their meetings there, and there exercise control of the corporation. In such a case the corporation would , under British law, have been deemed a resident of the United Kingdom and as such subject to tax upon all its income.

2588 DOUBLE INCOME TAX-SHIPPING PROFITS- GREAT BRITAIN.

It is equally clear, however, that such a corporation would be a corporation organized in the United States and deriving income from the operation of a ship or ships documented under the laws of the

United States, and would as such be entitled to exemption from British tax upon income derived from the operation of vessels of

the United States, if the exemption offered by Great Britain were to be deemed equivalent to that offered under American law.

It is understood that the proposal which the British Government now makes in its suggested draft of a Declaration in Council does

not require that the American corporation shall operate its business outside the United Kingdom in order to be entitled to exemption from British income tax. The British Government proposes , ac-

cording to the understanding of the Secretary of the Treasury, to

exempt from British income tax (including super-tax) " any profits accruing from the business of shipping carried on with ships documented under the laws of the United States to a citizen of the United

States resident outside the United Kingdom or to a corporation

organized in the United States ". Upon the explicit understanding that the American corporation is thus exempted regardless of whether it does business in the United Kingdom or has an office or place of business therein or whether directors' meetings are held in the

United Kingdom and the control of the corporation is there ex-

ercised, the Secretary of the Treasury is of the opinion that the offer communicated in the Embassy's note of February 11 , 1924, satisfies the requirements of Section 213 (b) (8 ) of the Revenue Act of 1924 , so far as the United Kingdom is concerned.

The Secretary of the Treasury asks that I make clear the fact that the Treasury Department intends to construe Section 213 (b) (8)

of the Revenue Act of 1924 as not affording exemption to British subjects or others resident in the British dominions , colonies, dependencies, or possessions , or to corporations organized under and

existing by virtue of the laws of the British dominions, colonies, dependencies, or possessions, unless the laws of such dominions, colonies, dependencies, or possessions grant an equivalent exemption to citizens of the United States and to corporations organized in the

United States. The exemption from tax of income derived from the

operation of ships of British registry will be confined to individuals resident in the United Kingdom, other than citizens of the United States, and to corporations organized under and existing by virtue of the laws of the United Kingdom .

Accept , Excellency , the renewed assurances of my highest consideration .

The appropriate authorities of this Government have been giving consideration to the matter and feel that some uncertainty exists with regard to the provision in the third paragraph of the Order in Council to the effect that the exemption shall be deemed to take effect on May 1 , 1923 , whereas your note transmitting the Order in Council dated November 7, 1924, states that it will take effect " from that date " .

I shall be grateful if you will be so good as to furnish me a state-

been decided that Great Britain satisfies the equivalent exemption
provisions of Section 213 (b ) (8 ) of the Revenue Act of 1921. Reference is also made to the Act of Congress approved June 2, 1924, known as the Revenue Act of 1924 , which contains the provision relating to taxation for 1924 and subsequent years. The provisions of Section 213 (b) (8 ) of the Revenue Act of 1924 are identical in terms with the corresponding section of the Revenue Act of 1921. It is therefore held that Great Britain satisfies the equivalent exemption
provisions of Section 213 (b) (8 ) of the Revenue Act of 1924 . It has also been determined that the exemption from Federal tax
under this holding shall be deemed to be effective from May 1 , 1923, the date stipulated by your Government as the date from which the exemption applies under British laws to the income of American citizens not resident in the United Kingdom and corporations or-
ganized in the United States, derived from the operation of ships. documented under the laws of the United States .

Reference is also made to the last paragraph of Mr. Grew's note dated August 11 , 1924, setting forth the construction to be placed upon Section 213 (b) (8 ) . In the last paragraph of your note No. 1106 dated November 18 , 1924, you stated that "the Irish Free State in common with the other British Dominions " was not to be considered as affected by the Order in Council. Accordingly the ex-

emption from Federal taxation in the United States will be applied on the basis of this understanding .

Proposal of the United States regarding

the question of the mutual recognition of ship measurement certifi- csehritipficmateesa.surement cates, with which you forwarded three copies in English of the

Esthonian Regulations for tonnage measurement of ships , I have the honor to inform you that the authorities of this Government concerned are satisfied that the vessels of Esthonia may be deemed to be of the tonnage noted in the Certificate of Registry or other

national papers, and that it will not, therefore, be necessary under existing law for such vessels to be remeasured in any port in the United States. It is, of course, requisite that the Government of Esthonia extend the same recognition to the Certificates of Registry or other national papers of the vessels of the United States.
I shall be obliged if you will bring the foregoing to the attention of

your Government and will inform me of the reply so that appropriate instructions may be given to the officers charged with the

enforcement of the navigation laws of this country.

In reply to your note of August 21 , 1926 in regard to the question of the mutual recognition of ship measurement certificates between the United States and Estonia, I have the honor to inform you in the name of my Government, that the concerned authorities of Estonia have found , that in substance there are no hindrances for the recognition, without remeasurement , of tonnage of ships of the United States in Estonian ports, as noted in the Certificate of Registry issued by the authorities of the United States or other national papers. In view of this the Government of Estonia has decided , on reciprocal basis , to recognize the tonnage of ships of the United States as stated herein-before.

lency the Secretary of State and, referring to his note of June 24th,

1925, has the honor to bring to his knowledge the following.

Reciprocal exemp

From a communication received from the Italian Steamship Com- tion, United States and

panies operating in ports of the United States it appears that the Italy. provisions contained in Royal Decree 891 issued on June 12 , 1925 , the text of which was submitted to the Department by the above mentioned note, did not seem to the competent Departments of the American Government to correspond exactly to the provisions contained in Section 213 (b) (8 ) of the Revenue Act of 1921 and was therefore considered insufficient to obtain to the Italian Companies exemption from the payment of the Income Tax, retroactively to 1921 , on the basis of reciprocity.

In order to establish the required adequate basis of reciprocity , the Italian Government issued on March 4th, 1926 a Royal Decree N.340, the text of which is literally translated as follows :
'Companies organized in the United States and citizens of the

"United States not domiciled in Italy exercising maritime traffic "in Italian ports, by means of ships flying the United States "flag are exempt, with effect starting from January 1st, 1921 , "from the Imposta di Ricchezza Mobile, Income Tax, on income de"rived esclusively from such traffic, provided the United States "likewise exempt from Income Tax, Imposta di Ricchezza Mobile, "the income originating in the United States to Italian citizens not "domiciled in the United States and to Italian Companies, and de"rived exclusively from the exercise of one or more ships flying the "Italian flag."

The provisions set forth in this Decree being exactly equivalent to those contained in Section 213 , the Italian Government is confident

that the competent American Authorities will extend to the Italian

Steamship Companies operating in United States ports the treat-

ment contemplated by Section 213 of the Revenue Act of 1921 , and this with effect starting from January 1st, 1921 .
The Italian Ambassador would much appreciate receiving some assurance in the matter.

The Secretary of State presents his compliments to His Excel-

acknowledge the receipt of his note of April 24, 1926, in further

relation to a decree issued by the Italian Government on March 4, 1926, exempting American shipping interests from the income tax

of Italy, in which the Ambassador requests to be informed what decision has been taken by the Treasury Department concerning

the exemption of Italian shipping interests from the payment of income tax .

In reply, the Secretary of State has the honor to inform the Italian Ambassador that he is in receipt of a communication from the Treasury Department concerning this matter, a copy of which is enclosed, from which it will be observed that the Treasury Department holds that in view of the Royal Italian Decree No. 340 of March 4, 1926 , Italy satisfies the equivalent exemption provision of Section 213 (b) (8 ) of the Revenue Acts of 1921 , 1924 and 1926 , and that consequently so much of the income from sources within the United States received by a non-resident alien or a foreign corporation as consists exclusively of earnings derived from the operation of a ship or ships documented under the laws of Italy is exempt from the Federal income tax.

the profits derived from maritime enterprises, on the basis of reciprocity .
Greek law contains the following exemptions on this subject : 1. Article 30, paragraph 8 of Law No. 3338 of June 15 , 1925 : "The ordinance in paragraph 7 of Article 3 of this law has retroactive effect with respect to the income tax of the years 1919-1920 up to 1924-1925 , as well as that of excess profits of the year 1915 and the following years, and also with respect to the additional tax on corporations of the year 1921 and the following years." 2. The ordinance of Article 3 , paragraph 7 of Law No. 3338 above mentioned, ends as follows :
" To paragraph 3 of Article 18 of Law 1640 concerning the taxation of income there is added as the sixth case the following exemption. Sixth case : 'In virtue of reciprocity, profits made in Greece by vessels flying a foreign flag.'
The two ordinances mentioned above guarantee the exemption of foreign shipping concerns in virtue of reciprocity.
The income tax has been in force since 1919-1920, that is to say, since the date for which retroactive effect was stipulated in the law. The tax on excess profits was in force from 1915 until 1923 , and the additional tax on corporations from 1921 until 1924 .

[Extract] DEPARTMENT OF STATE, WASHINGTON, April 26, 1928.
The Secretary of State presents his compliments to the Greek Minister and has the honor to refer to the Minister's note of February 29, 1928, setting forth the provisions of the Greek income tax law
exempting from taxation earnings made in Greece by ships flying a foreign flag.
The Secretary of State has the honor to inform the Greek Minister that before it can be determined whether these exemptions are equivalent to the exemptions that may be accorded by the United States under Section 213 (b ) (8) of the Revenue Acts of 1921 and 1924 it will be necessary for the appropriate authorities of the Government to be informed as to whether :
(a) during the years 1921-1924 , inclusive, taxes have been collected by the Greek Government from the revenues of American citizens not residing in Greece or of corporations organized under the laws of the United States, derived from the operation of ships documented under the laws of the United States ;
(b) the exemption provided in Article 3, Paragraph 7 of the Law, No. 3338 applies to the profits derived by a citizen of the United States not residing in Greece, and to corporations organized under the laws of the United States, or whether in the case of such citizen the exemption only applies if he resides in the United States ;
(c) the exemption applies in cases where citizens of the United States or corporations organized under the laws of the United States maintain agencies, branch offices, or representatives in Greece, in connection with the operation of ships documented under the laws of the United States.

In this connection the Secretary of State has the honor to state that he has been informed by the appropriate authorities of the Government that if it is eventually determined that the pertinent exemptions in the Greek income tax law are equivalent to the exemption provision of Section 213 (b) (8 ) of the Revenue Acts of 1921 and 1924 it will be unnecessary for the United States to conclude any agreement with Greece relative to the exemption of earnings derived from the operation of ships documented under the laws of the two countries.
if the Greek Minister will supply the additional information needed the appropriate authorities of the Government will be able to arrive at a definite decision with reference to the general question of the exemption of earnings made in the United States by ships flying the Greek flag.

The Greek Minister (Simopoulos ) to the Secretary of State (Stimson)

LEGATION OF GREECE,

WASHINGTON, April 2, 1929.

The Minister of Greece presents his compliments to His Excellency

the Secretary of State and , referring to the Department's Note of April 26 , 1928 , No. 811.512368 Shipping/4, has the honor to inform that the exemptions of the Greek law are equivalent to the exemptions that may be accorded by the United States under Section 213 (B) (8 ) of the Revenue Acts of 1921 and 1924.

Concerning the Department's inquiry as to whether " A " during the years 1921-1924 inclusive, taxes have been collected by the Greek

Government from the revenues of American citizens residing in Greece or of corporations organized under the laws of the United

States, derived from the operation of ships documented under the laws of the United States, the Minister of Greece is authorized to

state that for the years 1921-1924 inclusive, no taxes have been col-

lected by the Greek Government from the revenues of American citizens whether residing in Greece or not, or of shipping corpora-

tions organized under the laws of the United States for revenues deriving from operation of American ships in Greece.

With regard to question " B" whether the exemption provided in Article 3, Paragraph 7 of the Law No. 3338 applies to the profits

derived by citizens of the United States not residing in Greece, and to corporations organized under the laws of the United States or whether in the case of such citizens the exemption only applies if

he resides in the United States, the Minister of Greece is authorized

to state that the exemption provided in Article 3, Paragraph 7 of the Greek Law No. 3338 is applied on the profits derived by a citizen of the United States whether residing in Greece or not as well as

to the shipping companies organized under the American laws. As to question "C" whether the exemption applies in cases where
citizens of the United States or corporations organized under the laws of the United States maintain agencies, branch offices , or

representatives in Greece, in connection with the operation of ships documented under the laws of the United States, the Minister of Greece is authorized to state that the exemption is applied generally not only for the American citizens and the American shipping enter-
prise but on the American ships in Greece. Accordingly it is determined that the pertinent exemptions in
the Greek Income Tax Law are equivalent to the exemption
provisions of Section 213 (b ) (8 ) of the Revenue Acts of 1921 and 1924 .

DOUBLE INCOME TAX-SHIPPING PROFITS GREECE.
The Minister of Greece should be exceedingly obliged if His Excellency the Secretary of State were kind enough to arrive at a definite decision with reference to the general question of exemption of earnings made in the United States by ships flying the Greek flag on the basis of reciprocity and in case that an agreement on this matter would be necessary the Minister of Greece is duly authorized to sign it.

DEPARTMENT OF STATE, WASHINGTON, June 10, 1929. The Secretary of State presents his compliments to the Minister StAagtrese.ement byUnited of Greece and has the honor to inform the Minister, with reference to his note No. 422 of April 2 , 1929 , relative to the provisions of the Greek net income tax law whereby ships flying a foreign flag may be exempted from taxation on the profits made in Greece, that the Secretary of the Treasury has notified the Department of State as follows : "Inasmuch as Greece has not taxed the income of a citizen of the United States not residing in Greece and of a corporation organized in the United States derived from the operation of ships flying the American flag from 1921 and does not tax such income under the present law, Greece satisfies the equivalent exemption provisions of section 213 (b) (8 ) of the Revenue Acts of 1921 , 1924 , and 1926 and sections 212 (b) and 231 (b ) of the Revenue Act of 1928. It is held , therefore, that the income of a nonresident alien individual and a foreign corporation from sources within the United States which consists exclusively of earnings derived from the operation of a ship or ships documented under the laws of Greece is not required to be included in gross income and is exempt from income, excess-profits and warprofits taxes for 1921 and subsequent years. If any tax on such income has been paid it will be refunded upon proper claims therefor being made by taxpayers who are entitled to the exemption, provided the period of limitation for making refunds has not expired."

If this be not the case, the King can decide that foreign persons , companies and corporations shall pay taxes on property and/or income on activities as mentioned . In so far as sale of tickets for transportation of persons out of the kingdom is concerned , this does not apply but when the sale is effected through an agent or commissioner under the Law on Emigration of May 22, 1869 , see Law of June 5 , 1897 , and Law No. 1 of September 16 , 1921.

I have the honor to refer to your note of November 26 , 1924 , con-

which, in you opinion , reaffirm the reciprocal exemption of income and excess and war profits taxes in Norway and the United States

with regard to income derived from the operation of ships under their respective flags .

It appears from the enclosures transmitted with your note that the Norwegian laws of August 11 , 1924 , in translation , provide in part as follows :

"Persons, companies and corporations belonging in a foreign country are exempt from taxes on property in and income from

ship[s ] engaged in traffic on a Norwegian port or between Norwegian ports and from taxes on income arising from the sale of tickets

for the transportation of persons out of the kingdom ; provided

that Norwegian persons, companies and corporations are exempt

in the country in question from taxes on corresponding

activities .

I have the honor to inform you that it has been held by the appropriate authorities of this Government that the provision of the

Norwegian laws of August 11 , 1924, above quoted , satisfies the equivalent exemption provision of Section 213 (b) (8 ) of the Revenue

Act of 1924, and that, therefore, the income of a non-resident alien

or foreign corporation, which consists exclusively of earnings derived

from the operation of a ship or ships documented under the laws

of Norway, is exempt from Federal income taxes imposed by the

Revenue Act of 1924.

In reply to Mr. Hughes' note I have been authorized by my Government to confirm to Your Excellency the existence of reci-

Reciprocal exemption, United States and

my attention to Article 6 of Executive Decree No. 5,623 , of Decem-

ber 29, 1928 , by which His Excellency the President of the Republic sanctioned a law of Congress which "Reduces the duties on rolling and traction material for railroad and city transportation ; alters the

tax on paper for wrapping fruits ; exempts from duties the importa-

tion of gold in bars and coined ; regulates the payment by ' exercicio findo ' and adopts other measures.'
Article 6 of said Law states :

"Foreign navigation companies are hereby exempted from income

tax, provided that the country in which their head office is located, grants exemption to Brazilian companies of the same character."
According to the dispositions of Section 213 (b ) (8) of the Revenue Laws of the United States of 1924 and 1926 which were also included

in the Revenue Law of the United States of 1928 in Section 212 (b) and 231 (b) :

"(8) The income of a foreigner non-resident or of a foreign cor-
poration which consists exclusively of profit derived from a ship or ships operating under the laws of a foreign country which grants equal exemption to citizens of the United States and to corporations organized in the United States.
It would appear that the above mentioned Revenue Laws of the
United States contain a provision which would meet the terms of Article 6 , of Executive Decree No. 5,623 of December 29 , 1928, and that therefore I am justified in requesting Your Excellency's Government to exempt the United States Shipping Board from payment of the Brazilian income tax.

Supplementing its Note Verbale No. III A 522 of March 19 last, regarding the exemption of American shipping companies from the corporation tax, the Foreign Office has the honor to inform the Embassy of the United States of America that the Federal Minister of Finance has instructed the financial authorities , in the case of com-
mercial companies whose seat and place of direction is in the United States of America, not to subject to the corporation tax the income which comes exclusively from the operation of ships and not to demand a corporation tax declaration as to the above-mentioned from the North American companies which maintain in Germany a branch office, any other place of operation or a permanent representative. This instruction was issued on condition of reciprocity on the part of the United States and under the reservation that it may be recalled at any time.
The said Minister has furthermore declared his readiness to grant the favored treatment accorded to North American shipping companies also to citizens (individual persons) of the United States of America who carry on shipping traffic to Germany, if the Government of the United States of America grants reciprocity in the same degree.
The Foreign Office would be grateful to the Embassy of the United States of America if the latter would report the above to its Government with the greatest possible despatch and obtain a statement as to the attitude of the Government toward the question of exemption from taxation of the above-described individual persons .

The Embassy of the United States of America presents its compliments to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and has the honor to refer to the latter's Note Verbale No. V. Steu 1496 of September 5, 1923 , in which the Embassy was informed among other things that the Commonwealth Minister of Finance had issued certain instructions not [ to] subject to the corporation tax the income derived exclusively from the operation of ships by commercial companies whose seat and place of direction are in the United States of America under certain circumstances mentioned, on condition of reciprocity on the part of the United States .
In accordance with the expressed desire of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs the contents of the note verbale under reply were communicated by cable to the Department of State, which has now sent a telegraphic reply.

DOUBLE INCOME TAX-SHIPPING PROFITS-GERMANY.

In this telegram the Embassy is informed that the Treasury Department states that it is necessary for a foreign government to exempt citizens of the United States not residing in the foreign country concerned as well as domestic corporations from the tax on earnings from sources within such country derived exclusively from the operation of ships in order that such country may satisfy the equivalent exemption provision of the section of the Revenue Act of 1921 communicated to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in the Embassy's Note No. 91 of June 28 , 1922.
The Embassy is informed further by the Treasury Department through the Department of State that, therefore, if the Minister of Commerce [Finance] will issue the same instructions to the financial authorities relative to citizens of the United States not residing in Germany as have been issued relative to domestic corporations Germany will have satisfied the equivalent exemption provision referred to . The Embassy is informed, that as soon as the Treasury Department receives notice through this Embassy that the additional instructions have been issued , it will issue a statement that Germany has satisfied this exemption provision.
If therefore the instructions referred to above are issued and the
Ministry for Foreign Affairs will so inform the Embassy, the Embassy will take pleasure in telegraphing to the Department of State the date on which they become effective .
The Department of State would appreciate also being informed whether Germany has ever demanded or collected or under the law may demand any income tax from citizens of the United States not
residing in Germany or domestic corporations on earnings derived from the operation of ships from January 1st, 1921 , to the date on which the above instructions if issued become effective .

October 27 , 1923 (No. 543 ) , and supplementing its own note verbale

of September 5, 1923 (V Steu 1496) , that, by an ordinance dated

January 5 , 1924, the Federal Minister of Finance has instructed the

competent financial authorities that incomes derived from the operation of ships by citizens of the United States of America (individual

persons) who have no residence in Germany are likewise to be ex-

empted from the income tax, under the condition of reciprocity and the

reservation of repeal at any time, as has already been ordered by a proclamation of August 10, 1923 , relating to American commercial

companies as affected by the corporation tax. Furthermore, according to the investigations undertaken by the
German Government, citizens of the United States who have no residence in Germany, as well as American shipping companies which receive their incomes from the operation of ships, have not been subjected in Germany to either the income or the corporation tax since January 1 , 1921 .

The Foreign Office would be grateful for a statement as to whether

now the Government of the United States of America will grant to

German shipping companies and individual persons engaged in shipping the same exemption from taxation of incomes derived from the

operation of ships, and particularly so with retroactive effect from

The Embassy of the United States of America presents its compliments to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, and has the honor to refer

to the latter's Note Verbale No. V Steu 30/B 2556 of January 19,

1924, concerning the question of the taxing by Germany of earnings derived from the operation of ships documented under the laws of the

United States. As will be remembered , the Embassy, by its Note

Verbale No. 299 of March 2 , 1923 , informed the Ministry for For-

eign Affairs that a copy of the Note Verbale above referred to had

been duly transmitted to the Department of State .

The Embassy of the United States of America now has the honor to inform the Ministry for Foreign Affairs that an instruction has been received from the Department of State, transmitting a ruling

received from the Treasury Department on this subject, with reference to the Foreign Office's note of January 19 , 1924, requesting additional information on the following points :

"In the Ordinance of August 10, 1923, it is noted ' that in the case of companies operated for profit, whose domicile and place of manage-

ment is in the United States of America, the income which is derived

exclusively from the operation of ships, shall not be subjected to the corporation tax. A corporation tax return for the aforesaid income

is not to be required of North American companies which maintain

in this country a branch or other place of operation or a continuous [permanent] representative.'

"Under this provision of the Ordinance of August 10 , 1923, it

appears that an American corporation whose place of management,

for instance, is in London, might possibly be taxed while an American corporation whose place of management is in the United States or

Germany, would be exempted . In order for individual Germans and German shipping companies to be entitled , under the provisions of

American law, to the benefits of reciprocity in the matter of exemption from taxation, it would be necessary for the Ordinance of August 10 ,

1923, to apply to all corporations organized in the United States regardless of the place of management.
"Moreover, in order to enable the Government of the United States

to pass upon the question as to whether equivalent exemption is applicable from January 1 , 1921 , the Treasury Department states that it will be necessary for the German Government to show that

citizens of the United States non-resident as to Germany and domestic

corporations have not been subjected to income and corporation tax

since January 1 , 1921 , and the earnings derived from the operation

of ships, and that they are exempt from such taxes and will not be required to pay the income and corporation tax on any income earned

since January 1 , 1921. "

The Embassy of the United States of America begs further, in

compliance with the request of the Department of State, that an

early consideration of its response be given by the Foreign Office .

As concerns the conditions for abstention from collection of taxes

Furthermore, the German Government will abstain from a supplementary collection of taxes for the period since January 1 , 1921 , if the American Government grants reciprocity. The statement previously made by the Foreign Office through the usual diplomatic channels is a binding official declaration of the German Government.
The Foreign Office requests the Embassy of the United States of America to inform its Government of the above and to acquaint the Foreign Office with the American Government's attitude as soon as possible so that, if an agreement is reached between the German and American Governments, the Federal Minister of Finance may issue suitable instructions to the financial authorities .

In this connection it should be pointed out that certain German shipping concerns have been granted until December 15th to complete their 1923 tax returns and it is desirable that this information be communicated to the German Government as expeditiously as possible. This Department would appreciate prompt advice of the action of the competent German authorities.
It is to be observed from the foregoing that the Treasury Depart-
ment refers to the categorical statement of the German Foreign Office "That the German Government will abstain from a supplementary collection of taxes for the period since January 1 , 1921, if the American Government grants reciprocity " and that this statement is a " binding official declaration of the German Government. It will also be observed that the Treasury Department states that in view of this categorical statement and a proposed amendment by the Commonwealth Minister of Finance to his Order of August 10, 1923 , it considers that the German Government will meet the equivalent exemption provision of Section 213 (b) (8) of the Revenue Act of 1924 upon the issuance of the necessary orders referred to in the Ministry's Note of September 3, 1924 , under reference . The Treasury Department expresses the same opinion with respect to the years 1921 , 1922 and 1923 under the provision of Section 213 (b) (8 ) of the Revenue Act of 1921 .

In bringing the foregoing to the attention of the Ministry, the Embassy is instructed to point out that upon the completion of the action proposed in the Ministry's Note of September 3, 1924 , the equivalent exemption provision of Section 213 (b) (8 ) of both of the Revenue Acts of 1921 and 1924 will be satisfied and that the income

of a nonresident alien or foreign corporation from sources within the United States which consists exclusively of earnings of a ship or

ships documented under the laws of Germany will be exempt from

Federal income tax and that such exemption will be applicable for the

year 1921 and subsequent years. In view of the statement of the Treasury Department that certain

German shipping concerns have been granted until December 15th

to complete their 1923 tax returns, the Ministry will appreciate the

desirability of advising the Embassy as soon as possible with respect to the action taken by the German authorities in the matter of the proposed amendment by the Minister of Finance of his Order of

August 10, 1923, so that the Treasury Department of the United

States Government may, in turn , be definitely advised in the premises.

Subject: Exemption of North American navigation companies and shipowners from the income and corporation taxes.
I. By official order of August 10, 1923 (III C 7412) I have ordered , on the condition of complete reciprocity and subject to revocation at any time on the basis of section 108, paragraph 1 , of the Federal Tax Law, that in the case of companies operated for profits, the domicile and location of the management of which is in the United States of America, income derived exclusively from the operation of ships shall not be subject to a corporation tax.
Moreover, I declare myself as agreeing that the official order shall apply to all companies which have only their domicile in the United States, regardless of the location of the place of management. Therefore, in case a corporation tax should have been imposed on a company in your district which has its domicile in the United States, but the place of management of which is not in the United States, such company shall also hereafter be exempted from the corporation tax, as well as its income derived exclusively from the operation of ships. II . In explanation, I further point out that, on condition of complete reciprocity, the official order of August 10, 1923 (III C 7412) with the amplification resulting from the preceding paragraph, as well as the official order of January 5, 1924 (III C 14722) shall be applied, effective as of January 1, 1921 .

the claim of the heirs of Señor Manuel Arias Brios, and to the sug-

gestions made in my note of May 31 , last, relative to the desirability of an informal consideration of such claims as either Government

may now desire to bring to the attention of the other, was duly received and has had consideration.

With respect to His Excellency's request for a statement of the precise steps contemplated for the consideration of such claims, it is

suggested (1 ) that each Government should submit to the other on or before a specified date in the near future, a list of the claims which each desires to urge for the consideration and allowance of the other, together with a brief statement of the facts . This Government

would suggest that such lists should be exchanged by January 1 , 1928 . (2) Subsequently, at the expiration of an agreed period of time, say three months , required for the examination of the claims presented, the two Governments should designate representatives, one each, to

confer together in an effort to decide upon the merits of the claims, and, if possible to concur in conclusions as to the appropriate disposition to be made of each of the claims presented. (3) The claims which the representatives agree should be paid shall be referred by them to the respective Governments with their recommendations . (4) Cases in which the representatives do not agree or in which the recommendations of the representatives are not accepted by the two Governments might be disposed of by such further agreement as might at the time seem expedient.

CONSIDERATION OF CLAIMS- SPAIN.
As no reply to this communication has been received this Government is uncertain as to the acquiescence of the Spanish Government in the suggestions made therein. As previously indicated this Government is desirous of settling all outstanding claims between the two Governments and is willing to submit for consideration by the Spanish Government a list of claims in which it feels that satisfaction should be made. Before proceeding to the preparation of such list, however, it desires to be informed whether the arrangement proposed in its note of August 24, 1927 , is concurred in by the Spanish Government and whether that Government will submit a list of its claims to this Government for use in carrying out the purposes of the proposed arrangement.
It is understood that the claims referred to are distinct from those of American citizens and proteges which have arisen in that part of Morocco commonly known as the Spanish Zone and which were made the subject of a special arrangement through my predecessor's note of November 7, 1927, and Your Excellency's note of February 1 [ 11 ] , 1928, in reply thereto .

LEGATION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, TEHERAN, PERSIA, May 14, 1928.
EXCELLENCY : Commercial, etc. , agreement with Persia. I have the honor to inform you that my Government , animated
by the sincere desire to terminate as soon as possible the negotiations now in progress with the Imperial Government of Persia in regard to the conclusion of a Treaty of Friendship , as well as Establishment, Consular, Commercial and Tariff Conventions between the United States of America and Persia, has instructed me to communicate to the Imperial Government of Persia in its name the following provisional stipulations :
1 ) After May 10, 1928, the diplomatic representation of Persia in the United States, its territories and possessions, shall enjoy, on a basis of complete reciprocity, the privileges and immunities derived from generally recognized international law.
The Consular representatives of Persia, duly provided with exequatur, will be permitted to reside in the United States, its territories and possessions, in the districts where they have been formerly admitted .
They shall, on a basis of complete reciprocity, enjoy the honorary privileges and personal immunities in regard to jurisdiction and fiscal matters secured to them by generally recognized international law.
2 ) After May 10, 1928 , Persian nationals in the United States , its territories and possessions, shall , on a basis of complete reciprocity, be received and treated in accordance with the requirements and practices of generally recognized international law.
In respect to their persons and possessions, rights and interests, they shall enjoy the fullest protection of the laws and authorities of the Country, and they shall not be treated , in regard to the above mentioned subjects, in a manner less favorable than the nationals of any other foreign country.
In general, they shall enjoy in every respect the same treatment as the nationals of the Country, without , however, being entitled to the treatment reserved alone to nationals to the exclusion of all foreigners.
Matters of personal status and family law will be dealt with in separate notes to be concluded and exchanged at the earliest possible date .
3) After May 10, 1928, and as long as the present stipulations remain in force, and on a basis of complete reciprocity, the United States will accord to merchandise produced or manufactured in Persia upon entry into the United States, its territories and possessions, the benefits of the tariff accorded to the most favored nation ;

COMMERCIAL RELATIONS PERSIA.
from which it follows that the treatment extended to the products of Persia should not be less favorable than that granted to a third country .
In respect to the regime to be applied to the Commerce of Persia in the matter of import, export, and other duties and charges affecting commerce as well as in respect to transit warehousing and the facilities accorded commercial travelers ' samples ; and also as regards commodities, tariffs and quantities in connection with the licensing or prohibitions of imports and exports, the United States shall accord to Persia, on a basis of complete reciprocity, a treatment not less advantageous than that accorded to the commerce of any other country .
It is understood that no higher or other duties shall be imposed on the importation into or disposition in the United States, its territories or possessions, of any article, the product or manufacture of Persia, than are or shall be payable on like articles, the product or manufacture of any foreign country ; similarly, and on a basis of complete reciprocity, no higher or other duties shall be imposed in the United States, its territories or possessions, on the exportation of any articles to Persia than are payable on the exportation of like articles to any foreign country.
On a basis of complete reciprocity, any lowering of duty of any kind that may be accorded by the United States in favor of the merchandise of any other country will become immediately applicable without request and without compensation to the commerce of Persia with the United States, its territories and possessions .
Providing that this understanding does not relate to : 1 ) The treatment which the United States accords or may hereafter accord to the commerce of Cuba, or any of the territories or possessions of the United States, or the Panama Canal Zone, or to the treatment which is or may hereafter be accorded to the commerce of the United States with any of its territories or possessions , or to the commerce of its territories or possessions with one another ; 2) Prohibitions or restrictions authorized by the laws and regulations in force in the United States, its territories or possessions ,
aiming at the protection of the food supply, sanitary administration in regard to human, animal or vegetable life, and the enforcement of police and revenue laws.
The present stipulations shall become operative on the day of signature, and shall remain respectively in effect until the entry in force of the Treaty and Conventions referred to in the first paragraph of this note, or until thirty days after notice of their termination shall have been given by the Government of the United States to the Imperial Government of Persia, but should the Government of the United States be prevented by future action of its legislature from carrying out the terms of these stipulations the obligations thereof shall thereupon lapse.
I shall be glad to have your confirmation of the understanding thus reached.
I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the assurances of my highest consideration .

MR. MINISTER,

TEHERAN, May 14, 1928

I have the honor to advise you that my Government, animated by the sincere desire to terminate as soon as possible the negotiations now in progress with the Government of the United States relative to the

conclusion of a treaty of friendship, as well as establishment, consular, customs, and commercial conventions, has directed me to communicate to you, in its name, the following provisional stipulations :
1. On and after May 10, 1928 , the diplomatic representation of the United States of America in Persian territory shall enjoy, on con-

dition of complete reciprocity, the privileges and immunities sanctioned by generally recognized international law.
The consular representatives of the United States of America in

Persian territory, duly provided with an exequatur , shall be permitted, on condition of complete reciprocity, to reside there in the localities to which they were admitted up to that time.
They shall enjoy, on the condition of complete reciprocity, the honorary privileges and personal immunities in regard to jurisdiction and fiscal matters sanctioned by generally recognized international law.

2. On and after May 10, 1928 , the nationals of the United States in Persia shall on the basis of complete reciprocity be admitted and treated in accordance with the rules and practices of generally recognized international law.

In respect of their persons and property, rights and interests, they shall enjoy there the fullest protection of the laws and the territorial authorities of the country, and they shall not be treated in regard to the above-mentioned matters in a manner less favorable than the

nationals of other foreign countries.

They shall enjoy, in every respect, the same general treatment as the nationals of the country, without being entitled, however, to the treatment reserved to nationals alone, to the exclusion of all other foreigners .
Matters of personal status and family law shall be treated in special notes to be drawn up and exchanged as soon as possible.
3. On and after May 10, 1928, and as long as the present provisions shall remain in force, and on condition of complete reciprocity, merchandise produced or manufactured in the United States, its territories and possessions, on their entry into Persia , shall enjoy the tariff accorded to the most favored nation, so that the treatment accorded to the United States for its merchandise shall not be less favorable than the legal treatment accorded to a third country.

COMMERCIAL RELATIONS- PERSIA.
In respect to the régime applicable to the commerce of the United States of America, in the matter of import and export and other duties and charges relating to commerce, as well as to transit, warehousing, and the facilities accorded to commercial travelers ' samples , and as to facilities, tariffs, and quantities in connection with the licensing and prohibition of imports and exports, Persia shall accord to the United States, its territories, and possessions, on condition of complete reciprocity, a treatment not less favorable than that accorded to the commerce of any other foreign country.

Similarly and on condition of complete reciprocity, no other or higher duties shall be imposed in Persia on the exportation of any articles to the United States, its territories or possessions, than those which would be payable on the exportation of like articles to any other foreign country.
On condition of complete reciprocity, any lowering of duties of any kind that may be granted by Persia in favor of the products of any other country shall be immediately applicable, without request and without compensation, to the commerce of the United States , its territories and possessions, with Persia .
It is understood that these provisions do not refer to the prohibitions and restrictions authorized by the laws and regulations in force in Persia for protection of the food supply, sanitary administration in regard to human, animal, or vegetable life, the interests of public safety and fiscal interests.
The stipulations of the present note shall go into effect to-day and they shall remain respectively in force until the entry into effect of the corresponding treaty and conventions referred to in the first paragraph of this note or until the expiration of a period of thirty days from the notice which may be given to the Government of the United States by my Government of its intention to terminate them, but in case my Government should be prevented from fulfilling its engagements by the effect of a legislative measure, these stipulations shall lapse.
I would be glad to have confirmation of our understanding on these points .
Please accept, Mr. Minister, the assurance of my high consideration .

Section 126 ofthe Swedish Customs Regulations [Translation]

A master of a vessel belonging to a public yacht club or other similar association and which is not equipped for commercial purposes (pleasure yachts) shall, when the vessel arrives or departs from a port in the customs territory without being used for conveying goods other than foodstuffs and articles necessary for the vessel during the journey, be exempt from the duty to submit to the customs authorities a written report regarding the vessel and from obtaining a permit for it from the customs authorities .
When arriving from a port outside of the customs territory, the master may not visit any other port with the vessel than a customs port or a place where coast-guards are stationed . When arriving from and departing to a place outside the customs territory, it is the duty of a master to report personally to the nearest customs office or coast-guard station and to submit a certificate, issued by a public authority or the board of the association, showing the name of the vessel, number and tonnage, the name of the owner of the vessel and domicle, as well as the name of the association to which the vessel belongs.
If the owner or master of a pleasure yacht has here in the country been found guilty of illegal import or export of articles, the provisions granted in this section shall not apply to any of the vessels belonging to the association as long as he owns or commands the vessel . However, the advantages shall be discontinued not earlier than fifteen
days after the General Customs Board has informed the board of the association of the misdemeanor committed .
The provisions of this section shall not apply to vessels belonging to an association in Sweden, provided His Majesty has not granted the association similar rights for its vessels, and shall not either apply to vessels belonging to a foreign association , unless Swedish pleasure yachts enjoy the same advantages in the respective country.

EXCELLENCY :

STOCKHOLM, October 29, 1930.

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of Your Excellency's note dated October 22 , 1930, in reply to my note dated January 3, 1930, addressed to Your Excellency's predecessor, relating to the desire of my Government to obtain an agreement on the part of the Swedish Government to accord to American yachts in Swedish ports treatment in the matter of the payment of various port charges reciprocal to that which is now enjoyed by Swedish vessels calling at ports of the United States .
Your Excellency is so good as to inform me that, according to the terms of Section 126 of the Swedish Customs Regulations and of the Royal Decree dated October 7, 1927, yachts belonging to yacht clubs of countries where the same facilities are accorded to Swedish yachts are exempted in Swedish ports from all navigation dues except dues of pilotage when they have actually a pilot on board- provided that they be furnished with a certificate delivered by the authorities of the country and on the understanding that they are not equipped for commercial purposes .

In conclusion Your Excellency states that, if my Government consents to grant upon a basis of reciprocity the same facilities to pleasure

yachts belonging to Swedish yacht clubs, Your Excellency proposes that the note under reference and the reply which I may make thereto will serve as an agreement reached between our two countries .

In reply I have the honor to state that, inasmuch as the provisions of the Statutes of the United States for the collection of tonnage and light dues (U. S. Code, Title 46 , Sections 121 and 128) permit the suspension of those charges in behalf of vessels of foreign countries which accord national treatment to vessels of the United States, I am accord-

ingly gratified that there appears to be no further obstacle to the enjoyment by the pleasure yachts of each country of treatment recip-

rocal to that enjoyed in the ports of the other. I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the
assurances of my highest consideration .

MONSIEUR LE ChargÉ D'AFFAIRES :

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of the Embassy's note dated February 13, 1931 , informing me , with reference to the arrangement made between our two Governments in 1922 in respect of ship load-line certificates, that a law entitled "An Act to Establish Loadlines for American vessels, and for other purposes " has been enacted, and became effective September 2 , 1930, and inquiring whether or not the Japanese Government would be willing to continue the abovementioned arrangement of 1922 pending the coming into force of the International Ship Load-line Convention, which was signed at London on July 5 , 1930 .
When the notes were exchanged between the Japanese and American Governments in 1922 , no ship load-line law had been enacted in the United States, and the question of the recognition by the United States of load-line certificates of Japanese ships was not raised . Consequently , no definite arrangement was made regarding this matter, the Japanese Government merely undertaking unilaterally to recognize certificates issued by the American Bureau of Shipping, pending the enactment in the United States of a law regulating ship load-lines .

I wish to be assured , and request that you indicate in reply, that you have no objection to my interpreting your note, above-mentioned, to mean that pending the coming into force of the International
Ship Load-line Convention , the Japanese Government will continue the arrangement of 1922 while the American Government will also
recognize as valid load-line certificates duly issued by the competent Japanese authorities or by officially designated shipping associations , and their corresponding marks .
Pending the receipt of your reply, the Japanese Government will continue to regard the arrangement of 1922 as effective, and I trust that the American Government will also recognize as valid the ship load-line certificates issued by the competent Japanese authorities or by officially designated shipping associations, and their corresponding marks .
In compliance with your request, I have the honor to transmit herewith a copy of the laws and ordinances, together with a copy in translation , relating to ship load-lines .
I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to you, Monsieur le Chargé d'Affaires, the assurances of my high consideration.

SIR, Arrangement with Denmark for the recip- By a note of November 4, 1930, my predecessor had the honor to
rloicnaelcreerctiofginciattieson. of load- address himself to you with an inquiry as to whether the United States Government would be ready to enter into a reciprocal load

line agreement with the Danish Government which should remain

effective pending the coming into force in the two countries of the

International Load Line Convention concluded at London on July 5, 1930, and whereby the Governments of Denmark and the United

States would each recognize as equivalent the load line laws and

regulations of the other and, therefore, their respective freeboard certificates of the marking of merchant vessels.

In reply you have by a note of August 25, 1931 , informed this

Legation that the Government of the United States is ready to con-

clude such a reciprocal agreement . You have further added that the Government of the United States understands that the load line

marks made under authority of the two Governments will be in accordance with load line certificates ; that the hull and super-

structures of the vessel certificated will not have been so materially altered since the issuance of the certificates as to affect the calcula-

tions on which the load line was based, and that alterations will not have been made so that the

(1 ) Protection of openings, (2) Guard Rails , (3) Freeing Ports , (4) Means of Access to Crews Quarters,

have made the vessel manifestly unfit to proceed to sea without danger to human life .
Having submitted this reply to my Government, I am now instructed to convey to you the following information : The Danish Government is ready to give full recognition , for the time until the International Load Line Convention mentioned above shall come
into force in both countries, to the load line rules and regulations of the Government of the United States and to the certificates and load line marks made on American merchant vessels pursuant thereto . In giving such recognition the Danish Government concurs, subject to reciprocity, in the foregoing understandings. I am, however, instructed to draw your attention to the fact that since the beginning of the negotiations regarding this temporary agreement the Danish rules concerning freeboard have undergone the following modification :
A provisional notification dealing with the application to Danish Ships of the International Load Line Convention of July 5, 1930 ,

LOAD-LINE CERTIFICATES- DENMARK.
has been issued by the Danish Ministry of Shipping and Fisheries on July 8, 1931. Pursuant to this Notification of which this Legation had the honor to forward to you a copy by a note of August 13 , 1931 , Danish ships in international trade have already been permitted to obtain freeboard and load line certificates in accordance
with the above quoted International Load Line Convention , which has been ratified by Denmark on July 30, 1931. The Danish Government assumes that also such certificates issued in accordance with the said Convention will be recognized in the United States pending the coming into force in both countries of the Convention.
I have the honor to request that you will be good enough to confirm the full recognition of the Government of the United States for the period mentioned above of the Danish load line laws and regulations and the Danish freeboard certificates of the marking of merchant vessels, including the certificates issued pursuant to the foregoing Provisional Notification of July 8 , 1931 , and of load line marks made on Danish vessels pursuant thereto .
It is understood that upon the receipt of a note to that effect the proposed agreement will become effective as from the date of such note.

would remain effective pending the coming into force in the two countries of the International Load Line Convention of July 5 , 1930.
You made the proposal that if the Government of the United States agreed to the terms as outlined in your note of this date, that note and the reply which might be made thereto would serve as the agreement between our two countries.
Inasmuch as the Danish rules and tables for determining freeboards have been examined by the competent executive authorities of this Government and have been found to be as effective as the United States load line regulations ; and inasmuch as the Government
of the United States agrees to recognize the certificates issued by the Government of Denmark pursuant to the Provisional Notification of July 8, 1931 , which gives ship owners the privilege of having

In reply the Minister for Foreign Affairs has informed the American

Minister by a note of March 12 , 1931 , that the Government of Iceland would view with pleasure the conclusion of an agreement

such as proposed by the Government of the United States . It was further stated in the latter note that there do not exist any special
Icelandic laws and regulations concerning load lines of vessels , such lines being fixed for Icelandic vessels in conformity with the Danish provisions in force regarding load lines.
With reference to the above, I had the honor by my note of April
20, 1931 , to inquire whether the Government of the United States would be ready for the intervening time until the International Convention regarding Load Lines concluded at London on July 5, 1930, shall come into force in both Iceland and the United States , to enter into an agreement to the effect of reciprocally recognizing the Danish load line laws and rules as applied to Icelandic vessels and the load line laws and rules of the United States to be equivalent and therefore until then also reciprocally to recognize the freeboard certificates of Iceland and the United States.

In reply you have informed this Legation by your note of August 25, 1931, that the United States' Government is ready to enter into a reciprocal agreement as proposed . You have further added that the United States' Government understands that the load line marks on the vessels of the United States and Iceland will be in accordance
with the load line certificates ; that the hull and superstructures of the vessel certificated will not have been so materially altered since the issuance of the certificates as to affect the calculations on which

No. 81 .

CANADIAN LEGATION,

SIR :

Washington, May 5th, 1932.

Arrangement with Canada concerning

I have the honour to inform you that the Canadian House of

radio broadcasting. Commons recently appointed a committee to enquire into the whole

position of radio broadcasting in Canada . This committee has under

consideration a technical scheme for broadcasting in Canada which it is considered will provide satisfactory coverage in the chief population areas throughout the Dominion and at the same time make pro-

vision for the community service that may be desired . This scheme is divided into two distinct parts :

(a) A chain of high-power stations , operating on clear channels , and located at suitable intervals across Canada ;

(b) A number of low-power stations of very limited range, operating on shared channels, and located as required for community service .

If this scheme receives the approval of Parliament, it is proposed to use 50 K.W. stations, one in each of the Provinces of British Co-
lumbia, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec , and eventually one in the Maritime Provinces . In Saskatchewan and Alberta it is proposed to use 5 K.W. stations at present, two being used in each Province, synchronized on a common channel . In Ontario there will be, in addition, two 10 K.W. stations , one in Western Ontario and one in Northern Ontario . Four smaller stations of one K.W. capacity each are provided for the Port Arthur-Fort William area, and for Ottawa, Montreal, and Quebec. In the Maritimes, three 500-watt stations are provided for the present, one in each Province . The scheme
also includes a 500-watt station on the shared channels for the city of Toronto for local service .

In adopting this plan, Canada would reserve the right to increase the power of the stations in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Northern and Western Ontario to 50 K.W. each, should such increase become necessary .
The committee, in addition to considering the power required, propose the following channels as suitable for the main stations :

Prince Edward Island New Brunswick

Nova Scotia

Quebec

Montreal area ( 1 K.W. )

In order to ensure satisfactory local broadcast service throughout Canada, it is proposed that stations, limited to a maximum power of 100 watts, be erected where necessary, and that they should be operated on shared channels . It is considered that one hundred or more such stations may eventually be required in Canada, and that twenty channels should be available for this type of service . In establishing such stations, it is proposed to maintain the same geographical separation between Canadian and United States stations as is maintained between United States stations of the same power.
Due notification would, of course , be given of the effective dates of any changes in the present operation to conform with the above plan .
In the event of the adoption of the above arrangement, it is understood that if, as the result of the Madrid Conference, any additional channels are made available for broadcasting, a further allocation will be made, as between the United States and Canada, on an equitable basis .
I shall be obliged if you will inform me at your early convenience whether the United States authorities can make the necessary readjustments so that these channels will be available for effective use in Canada .

MINISTRY FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS ,

MR . CHARGÉ D'AFFAIRES :

Stockholm, June 1 , 1932.

By letter of January 27 last Mr. Morehead informed me that-- pending the coming into force between Sweden and the United States

of America of the international load line convention of July 5 , 1930-

the United States Government is prepared to agree with the Govern-

ment of the King that the competent Swedish and American authorities reciprocally recognize the load line marks of merchant vessels of

the other country, determined in conformance with the regulations

in force in the respective countries, as well as the load line certificates

delivered in conformance with the same regulations , on condition, however, that the marks should correspond to the indications set

forth in the load line certificates, that the hull and the superstructures

certified shall not have undergone after the delivery of the certificate

modifications of sufficient importance to affect the calculation upon which the load line was based and that alterations have not been made so that the

1 ) protection of openings,
2 ) guard rails , 3 ) freeing ports, and 4) means of access to crews quarters
have rendered the vessels manifestly unfit to proceed to sea without danger to human life. Mr. Morehead informed me at the same time that his Government is likewise prepared to agree with the Royal Government that the competent Swedish and American authorities reciprocally recognize load line marks for tankers and ships of special types determined in conformance with the regulations set forth by the above-mentioned convention for ships of special types ; he informed me furthermore of the desire of his Government to see the load line certificates delivered in such case by the Swedish authorities bear the indication that the load line marks are determined in conformance with the rules under reference.
In reply to this courteous communication I have the honor to inform you that the Government of the King approves the arrange-
ment set forth above and that it is ready to conform with the desire expressed by your Government concerning the indication to be

well as police offences and inquests in the International Settlement at

Shanghai, provided that the jurisdiction of the said courts over per-

sons shall be the same as that of other Chinese Courts and provided

that their territorial jurisdiction shall be the same as that of the

Chinese court now functioning in the International Settlement at

shall be followed, pending a definite arrangement between the Chinese Government and the authorities concerned .

3. It is understood that as far as practicable Chinese shall be

An Arrangement between Germany and the United States of America Providing for the Acceptance by the One Country of Certificates of Airworthiness for Aircraft imported from the Other Country as Merchandise .

2. The same validity shall be conferred on certificates of airworthi-
ness issued by the competent authorities of the German Government for aircraft subsequently to be registered in the United States as if they had been issued under the regulations in force on the subject in the United States, provided that in each case a certificate of airworthiness for export has also been issued by the authorities of the German Government for the individual aircraft and provided that certificates of airworthiness issued by the competent authorities in the United States for aircraft subsequently to be registered in Germany are similarly given the same validity as if they had been issued under the regulations in force on the subject in Germany.
3. The above arrangement shall extend to civil aircraft of all categories, including those used for public transport and those used for private purposes .
4. The present arrangement may be terminated by either Government on sixty days' notice given to the other Government . In the event, however, that either Government should be prevented by future action of its legislature from giving full effect to the provisions of this arrangement it shall automatically lapse.

I shall be glad to have Your Excellency inform me whether the text of the arrangement herein set forth is as agreed to by your Government. If so, it is suggested that it be understood that the arrangement will come into force on June 1 , 1932 .

HERR BOTSCHAFTER ! Ich habe die Ehre, Euerer Exzellenz nachstehend den Wortlaut Agreement by Ger many.
der Vereinbarung zwischen Deutschland und den Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika über die gegenseitige Anerkennung von Lufttüchtigkeitszeugnissen von Luftfahrzeugen, die als Handelsware aus dem anderen Lande eingeführt werden, mitzuteilen, wie er in den Verhandlungen zwischen der Botschaft der Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika und dem Auswärtigen Amt zustande gekommen ist. Er lautet :
Vereinbarung zwischen Deutschland und den Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika über die gegenseitige Anerkennung von Lufttüchtigkeitszeugnissen von Luftfahrzeugen, die als Handelsware aus dem anderen Lande eingeführt werden.

1. Diese Vereinbarung bezieht sich auf Zivilluftfahrzeuge, die in Deutschland hergestellt und nach dem Festland der Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika, mit Ausnahme von Alaska ausgeführt werden, sowie auf Zivilluftfahrzeuge, die auf dem Festland der Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika, mit Ausnahme von Alaska, hergestellt und nach Deutschland ausgeführt werden .

stellt sind, die später in den Vereinigten Staaten eingetragen werden sollen, soll die gleiche Gültigkeit beigelegt werden, als ob sie nach den hierfür in den Vereinigten Staaten geltenden Bestimmungen ausgestellt worden wären. Voraussetzung hierfür ist, dass auch ein Lufttüchtigkeitsschen für Ausfuhrzwecke von den Behörden der Deutschen Regierung für das einzelne Luftfahrzeug erteilt worden ist und dass die von den zuständigen Behörden in den Vereinigten Staaten ausgestellten Lufttüchtigkeitsscheine für diejenigen Luftfahrzeuge, die später in Deutschland eingetragen werden, dort in gleicher Weise Gültigkeit haben, als wenn sie nach den in Deutschland geltenden Vorschriften ausgestellt worden wären .
3. Die vorstehende Vereinbarung soll sich auf die Zivilluftfahrzeuge aller Arten erstrecken, einschliesslich derjenigen des öffentlichen Verkehrs und derjenigen, die zu privaten Zwecken verwendet werden.
4. Diese Vereinbarung kann von jeder der beiden Regierungen der anderen gegenüber mit 60tägiger Frist gekündigt werden. Falls indes eine der beiden Regierungen durch einen späteren gesetzgeberischen Akt daran verhindert sein sollte, die Bestimmungen dieser
Vereinbarung voll durchzuführen, so soll sie automatisch hinfällig werden .

EMBASSY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,

MINISTER, Arrangement with Belgium for the recip- I have the honor to refer to your Excellency's note of March 31 , rlionceal rceerctoigfniciattoens.of load- 1931 , (Direction Générale B. , Section I.B./Communications , No. C.24/1081 ) pertaining to the conclusion between the Governments of
Belgium and the United States of a reciprocal agreement concerning ship load lines.

Pursuant to instructions from my Government, I now have the

honor to inform Your Excellency that the substance of this note and

the text of the excerpt of the Belgian law of August 25, 1920, submitted

therewith, have been examined by the competent authorities of my Government.

In answer to the inquiry whether the American Government does not share the view of the Belgian Minister of Transports that the

reciprocal agreement concerning the inspection of vessels, existing between the two countries since June 1 , 1922 , would be applicable to

the control of load lines, I have the honor to inform Your Excellency that the competent authorities of my Government do not believe that this agreement could be interpreted to cover load lines, and that they consider it would be preferable to negotiate a separate arrangement.
The Government of the United States has taken due notice of the

Belgian law which provides that "the freeboard of vessels shall be determined in accordance with the rules and freeboard tables of the

French Bureau Veritas or of Lloyds Registry of Shipping, or in accordance with rules and tables recognized as equivalent thereto."
In connection with this provision, my Government is willing to conclude a reciprocal agreement in regard to load lines with the Government of Belgium with the understanding that the rules and freeboard tables employed by the French Bureau Veritas and by Lloyds Registry of Shipping are the freeboard rules and tables of the French Government and the 1906 rules of the British Board of Trade,

respectively .

Subject to the above understanding the Government of the United States is prepared to agree that pending the coming into force of the International Load Line Convention of 1930, in the United States and

Belgium, the competent authorities of the Government of the United States will recognize the load line marks and the certificate of such

marking on the merchant vessels of Belgium made in accordance with either of the foregoing systems of rules and tables as equivalent to load line marks and certificates of such markings made pursuant to

the laws and regulations of the United States ; provided, that the load line marks are in accordance with the load line certificates ; that

LOAD-LINE CERTIFICATES- BELGIUM.
the hull and superstructure of the vessel certificated have not been so materially altered since the issuance of the certificate as to affect the calculations on which the load line was based ; and that alterations have not been made so that the
(1 ) Protection of openings, (2) Guard Rails, (3) Freeing Ports, (4) Means of Access to Crews Quarters , have made the vessel manifestly unfit to proceed to sea without danger to human life. It will be understood by this Government that on the receipt by the Embassy of a note from Your Excellency to the effect that the competent authorities of the Belgian Government will recognize the load line marks and certificates thereof on merchant vessels of
the United States, executed pursuant to the laws and regulations of this Government, as equivalent to load line marks and certificates made in accordance with the laws and regulations in force in Belgium, and expressing the Belgian Government's concurrence in this Government's understanding as above set forth, the agreement will become effective .
I avail myself of this occasion to renew to Your Excellency the assurance of my highest consideration.

Direction Générale B.

Bruxelles, le 4 février 1932

Section I. B., Comm. No. C.24/354

MONSIEUR LE CHARGÉ D'AFFAIRES ,

Je n'avais pas manqué de porter à la connaissance de M. le Ministre des Transports les termes de la lettre de l'Ambassade en date du 7 octobre dernier, No. 708, au sujet de la conclusion entre les deux pays d'un accord provisoire concernant la limite de charge des navires.
J'ai l'honneur de vous faire connaître que les règles et tables de franc-bord que rappelle l'art. 161 de l'arrêté royal du 8 novembre 1920, formant règlement d'application de la loi sur la sécurité des navires, sont bien les règles et tables de franc-bord du Gouvernement français, appliquées par la Bureau Veritas et les règles de 1906 du Board of Trade britannique appliquées par le " Lloyd's Register of Shipping.'
Etant donné que le Gouvernement des Etats-Unis estime ne pas pouvoir se rallier à la proposition qui lui a été présentée , d'appliquer en matière de franc-bord l'accord de réciprocité concernant la sécurité des navires , conclu en 1922, le Gouvernement du Roi accepte l'arrangement proposé par le Gouvernement des Etats-Unis .
Celui-ci aura donc un caractère provisoire et est destiné à prendre fin dès que les deux Gouvernements auront ratifié la Convention internationale sur les lignes de charge et que celle-ci aura été mise en vigueur.

2738

LOAD-LINE CERTIFICATES- BELGIUM.
Le Gouvernement du Roi déclare, en conséquence, que, par mesure de réciprocité répondant aux mesures annoncées par le Gouvernement américain, le Gouvernement belge admettra, qu'en attendant l'entrée en vigueur aux Etats-Unis et en Belgique de la Convention Internationale sur les lignes de charge du 5 juillet 1930, et sous réserve des conditions énoncées ci-dessous , les autorités compétentes du Gouvernement belge reconnaîtront les marques de ligne de charge et le certificat de démarcation des navires de commerce sous pavillon des EtatsUnis établis conformément aux lois et règlements en vigueur aux Etats-Unis, comme étant équivalents aux marques de lignes de charge et certificats de ces démarcations établis conformément à la loi belge.
Cette reconnaissance est subordonnée aux conditions suivantes :
1) les marques de lignes de charge seront conformes aux certificats de lignes de charge ;
2 ) la coque et les superstructures du navire auquel le certificat est délivré n'auront pas subi, depuis la délivrance du certificat, des modifications d'une importance telle qu'elles affectent les calculs sur lesquels la ligne de charge a été basée ;
3) les modifications apportées ne seront pas de nature telle que la protection des ouvertures, les maincourantes, les sabords de décharge, les moyens d'accès aux postes de l'équipage aient manifestement rendu le navire impropre à se rendre en mer sans danger pour la vie humaine .
Connaissance est donnée du présent arrangement aux services belges d'inspection maritime qui reçoivent pour instructions de l'observer dès à présent.
Il convient de remarquer que la correspondance qui a été échangée au sujet de la question traitée ci-dessus est antérieure à l'arrêté royal du 14 septembre 1931 qui permet aux propriétaires belges d'obtenir pour leurs navires le franc-bord établi conformément au règlement annexé à la Convention Internationale sur les lignes de charge signée à Londres, le 5 juillet 1930 ; cet arrêté royal introduit donc dans cette question un élément nouveau dont il n'a pu être tenu compte.
Mais cette circonstance n'est pas de nature à énerver l'arrangement proposé attendu que le règlement américain sur les francs-bords est identique au règlement annexé à la Convention mentionnée.
Puisque le Gouvernement des Etats-Unis est disposé à reconnaître les francs-bords des navires belges attribués suivant les anciennes
règles, le Gouvernement du Roi estime donc acquis qu'il reconnaîtra également le franc-bord assigné dans les conditions prévues dans le nouveau règlement belge sur la matière . Il estime cependant opportun d'attirer encore l'attention du Gouvernement des Etats-Unis sur
le fait que, suivant ce dernier règlement la marque de l'autorité habilitée en Belgique pour l'assignation des francs-bords consiste dans les
lettres B.I. lorsque le franc-bord est établi par le service officiel belge qualifié à cet effet.
J'ai l'honneur de vous faire parvenir à ce propos les 3 exemplaires de l'arrêté royal du 14 septembre 1931 ainsi que 3 formulaires du certificat de franc-bord du modèle utilisé par l'inspection maritime belge.2
Je vous saurais gré, Monsieur le Chargé d'Affaires , de m'adresser une communication marquant l'accord du Gouvernement des EtatsUnis au sujet du présent arrangement .

LOAD-LINE CERTIFICATES-BELGIUM.

La date de cette communication pourrait être considérée comme

indiquant la mise en vigueur de l'arrangement. Veuillez agréer , Monsieur le Chargé d'Affaires, l'assurance de ma
considération la plus distinguée . Pour le Ministre :

Le Directeur Général.

Chargé d'Affaires des Etats- Unis, Bruxelles .

[Translation]

General Division B Section I.B. , Comm. No. C.24/354

MINISTRY FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS , Brussels, February 4, 1932.

SIR :

I did not fail to inform the Minister for Transportation of the contents of the Embassy's note of October 7 last , No. 708 , concerning the negotiation between the two countries of a temporary agreement on load-line regulations of vessels.
I have the honor to inform you that the regulations and tables of load lines which are mentioned in article 161 of the royal decree of November 8, 1920, constituting a ruling for the application of the law concerning the safety of vessels , are the regulations and tables of load lines of the French Government as given by the Veritas Bureau and the rules of 1906 of the British Board of Trade as given in " Lloyd's Register of Shipping."
As the Government of the United States feels that it cannot assent

to the proposal that has been submitted to it, of applying in the matter of load-line regulations the reciprocity agreement concerning
the safety of vessels , concluded in 1922 , the Government of the King accepts the arrangement proposed by the Government of the United States.

This arrangement will have, therefore, a temporary character and is destined to come to an end as soon as the two Governments shall
have ratified the international agreement concerning load lines and as soon as this agreement shall come into force .
The Government of the King declares, consequently, that as a measure of reciprocity corresponding to the measures stated by the American Government, the Belgian Government will, in the interim before the enforcement in the United States and in Belgium of the international agreement on load lines, of July 5 , 1930 , and with the exception of the conditions set forth below, permit competent authorities of the Belgian Government to recognize the marks of the load lines and the certificates of these lines for merchant vessels under the
United States flag, when these are established in conformity with the laws and regulations in force in the United States, as being equivalent to the marks of the load lines and the certificates of these lines

established in conformity with Belgian law. This recognition is subject to the following conditions : 1 ) The marks of the load lines shall correspond to the certificates
of the load lines ;
2) Alterations of sufficient importance to affect the calculations on which the load line was based shall not have been made , since the issuance of the certificate, to the hull and to the superstructure of the vessel concerned ;

2739

2740

LOAD -LINE CERTIFICATES- BELGIUM.
3) The alterations made shall not be of such a nature that the protection of openings, handrails, cargo ports, means of access to the crew's stations, shall render the vessel manifestly unfit to go to sea without danger to human life.
The Belgian Maritime Inspection Service has been notified of the present arrangement and instructed to observe it henceforth.
It is appropriate to point out that the correspondence exchanged on the subject discussed above, precedes the royal decree of September 14, 1931 , which allows Belgian shipowners to obtain for their vessels the load line established in conformity with the ruling forming an annex to the International Load Line Agreement signed at London on July 5 , 1930 ; thus this royal decree introduces into this question a new element which it has been impossible to take into consideration .
But this circumstance is not of a character to affect the proposed arrangement since the American ruling on load lines is identical with the ruling forming an annex to the agreement above mentioned .
Since the Government of the United States is disposed to recognize the load lines of Belgian vessels assigned according to the old regulations , the Government of the King takes it for granted that the Government of the United States will likewise recognize the load line assigned according to the conditions provided in the new Belgian ruling in this matter. The Government of the King considers it opportune, however, again to call the attention of the Government of the United States to the fact that, in accordance with this latter regulation, the assignment of load lines consists of the letters B.I. when the load line is established by the official Belgian authorities qualified for this purpose.
I have the honor to forward to you in this connection three copies of the royal decree of September 14, 1931 , as well as three copies of the official form of load-line certificate used by the Belgian Maritime Inspection Service .
I should appreciate your addressing me a letter stating the assent of the Government of the United States to the present arrangement.
The date of this communication could be considered as signifying the coming into force of the arrangement.
Be so kind as to accept, Sir, the assurance of my most distinguished consideration .
For the Minister : The Director General.

I have the honor to refer to Your Excellency's note of February 4,

to its enclosures, regarding the conclusion of an arrangement between

Belgium and the United States for the reciprocal recognition of ship load-line certificates .

LOAD-LINE CERTIFICATES-BELGIUM.

2741

My Government agrees, as requested in this note, to recognize the certificates issued by the Government of Belgium pursuant to the

Royal Decree of September 14, 1931 , which allows Belgian shipowners the privilege of obtaining for their vessels the load line estab-

lished in conformity with the ruling which forms an annex to the International Load Line Convention signed at London on July 5, 1930.

The Government of the United States accordingly understands that the arrangement has been completed by the exchange of notes and is effective from the date of this note.

I would greatly appreciate confirmation of this understanding, and I avail myself of this occasion to renew to you, Mr. Minister, the assurances of my highest consideration.
