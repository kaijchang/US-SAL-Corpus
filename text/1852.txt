inspectors be of the opinion, that said boiler by reason of its construction

Preamble. Parties.

Convention for the mutual delivery of criminals, fugitives from justice, in certain cases, concluded between the United States, on the one part, and Prussia and other

Whereas it is found expedient, for the better administration of justice and the prevention of crime within the territories and jurisdiction of the parties, respectively, that persons committing certain heinous crimes, being fugitives from justice, should, under certain circumstances,
be reciprocally delivered up; and also to enumerate such crimes explicitly ; and whereas the laws and Constitution of Prussia, and of the other German States, parties to this Convention, forbid them to surrender their own citizens to a foreign jurisdiction, the Government of the
United States, with a view of making the Convention strictly reciprocal, shall be held equally free from any obligation to surrender citizens of the United States ; 'therefore, on the one part, the United States of America, and on the other part, His Majesty the King of Prussia, in His own name as well as in the name of His Majesty the King of Saxony, His Royal Highness the Elector of Hesse, His Royal Highness the Grand Duke of Hesse and on Rhine, His Royal Highness the

Reciprocally, goods and merchandise, whatever their origin may be, imported into or exported from the ports of the Netherlands, from and to any other country, in vessels of the United States, shall pay no higher or other duties than shall be levied on the like goods and merchandise imported or exported in national vessels.
The bounties, drawbacks, and other privileges of this nature, which may be granted in the States of either of the contracting parties, on goods imported or exported in national vessels, shall also and in like manner be granted on goods imported or exported in vessels of the other country.

The above reciprocal equality in relation to the flags of the two coun-
tries is understood to extend also to the ports of the colonies and dominions of the Netherlands beyond the seas, in which goods and merchandise, whatever their origin
may be, imported or exported from and to any other country in vessels
of the United States, shall pay no higher or other duties than shall be levied on the like goods and merchandise imported or exported from
and to the same places in vessels of the Netherlands. The bounties,
drawbacks, or other privileges of similar denomination which may be
there granted on goods and merchandise imported or exported in
vessels of the Netherlands, shall also, and in like manner, be granted on

De voormelde wederkeerige gelykstelling van de vlaggen der beide

lowed to national vessels : it being

moreover understood, that, in the

East Indian Archipelago of the Ne-

therlands, the trade from island to

island is considered as coasting

trade, and likewise in the United

States, the trade between their ports

on the Atlantic and their ports on

the Pacific; and if, at any time,

either the Netherlands or the Uni-

ted States shall allow to any other

nation the whole or any part of the

said coasting trade, the same trade

shall be allowed on the same foot-

ing and to the same extent, to the

other party. It being, however,

expressly understood and agreed,

that nothing in this article shall

prevent the vessels of either nation

from entering and landing a portion

of theii' inward cargoes at one port

of the other nation, and then pro-

ceeding to any other port or ports

of the same, to enter and land the

remainder, nor from preventing

them in like manner from load-

ing a portion of their outward car-

goes at one port and proceeding to

another port or ports to complete

their lading, such landing or lading

to be done under the same rules

and regulations as the two govern-

ments may respectively establish

for their national vessels in like

cases.

De tegenwoordige overeenkomst strekt zich niet nit tot den kusthandel en tot de visscheryen van elk der beide landen, welke nitsluitend vergund zyn aan nationale schepen ; zynde men daarenboven overeenge komen, dat, met, opzigt tot den Nederlandschen Oost Indischen Archi-
pel, de handel van het eene eiland op het andere beschouwd wordt als kusthandel, en evenzoo, met opzigt tot de Vereenigde Staten, de handel tusschen de havens dier Staten aan den Atlantischen oceaan en die aan
de Stille Zuidzee gelegen; byaldien echter te eeniger tyd, hetzy de Nederlanden, hetzy de Vereenigde Staten, aan eenige andere natie den geheelen of eenig gedeelte van
gezegden kusthandel, zullen toestaan, dan zal diezelfde handel op gelyken voet en in dezelfde nitgestrektheid ook aan de andere Party, worden toegestaan, Niettemin is nitdrukkelyk over eengekomen en
goedgevonden, dat niets van het in dit artikel bepaalde de schepen der beide natien zal verhinderen een gedeelte van hunne ten .nivoer
bestemde lading in eene haven van de andere natie binnen te brengen en te lossen, en daarna naar eene andere haven of naar andere havens van dezelfde natie te vertrekken, om aldaar het overige der lading binnen te voeren en te lossen; noch hen zal beletten, op gelyke wyze, een gedeelte van hunne ten nitvoer bestende lading in eene haven binnen te nemen, en dan naar eene andere haven of naar andere havens te vertrekken, om hunne lading aantevullen; moetende zoodauig lossen of laden geschieden volgens de verordeningen en bepalingen als door
de beide Regeringen respectivelyk zullen zyn vastgesteld voor hunne
nationale schepen in gelyke gevallen.

Articl e V.

Artik el V.

The above reciprocal equality in
relation to the flags of the two countries is not understood to prevent the Government of the Netherlands from levying discriminating duties of import or export in favor of the
direct trade between Holland and her colonies and dominions beyond the seas; but American vessels engaged in such direct commerce,
shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities, whether as regards import or export duties, or otherwise, that are or may be enjoyed by vessels under the Dutch flag. Likewise, the United States shall continue to levy the discriminating duties imposed by the present tariff on teas and coffee, in favor of the direct importation of these articles from the place of their growth, but also without discriminating between the flags of the two countries. And if, at any time, the Netherlands or the United States shall abolish the said discriminating duties, it is under-
stood that the same shall be in like manner abolished in relation to the commerce of the other country.

De voormelde wederkeerige gelykstelling, met opzigt tot de vlag-. gen der beide Landen, wordt niet: beschouwd het Nederlandsche gouverenement te beletten, differentiele regten van in of nitvoer te heffen
ten gunste van het regtstreeksche verkeer tusschen Nederland en zyne
Kolonien en Overzeesche Bezittingen; doch Amerikaansche schepen,
tot dat regtstreeksche verkeer gebezigd, zullen geregtigd zyn tot alle de voordeelen en vrystellingen, met
opzigt tot de regten van in en nitvoer, als anderszins, welke door schepen onder Nederlandsche vlag varende worden of zullen worden genoten. Evenzoo zullen de Vereenigde Staten voortgaan te heffen de differentiele regten by het tegenwoordig tarief gelegd op thee en koffy ten gunste van den regtstreekschen invoer dier artikelen van de plaats hunner voortbrenging; maar zonder, evenmin, onderscheid te maken tusschen de vlaggen der beide Landen. En, byaldien, te eeniger tyd, Nederland of de Vereenigde Staten mogten besluiten gezegde differentiele regten afteschaffen, zoo is men evereengekomen,
dat die regten op dezelfde wyze zullen afgeschaft zynook met betrekking tot den handel van het andereland.

Discriminating
duties in favor
of certain trade may be imposed.
