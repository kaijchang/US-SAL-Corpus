embossed books superior in every way to any manufactured elsewhere,

Whereas it is desirable that the blind of the whole country should be

equally benefited, and the intentions of the trustees to establish an edu-

"Beginning at the point on the Potomac River where the line between Virginia and West Virginia strikes the said river at low- water mark, and thence, following the meanderings of said river, by the low-water mark, to Smith's Point, at or near the mouth of the Potomac, in the latitude thirty-seven degrees fifty- three minutes eight seconds, and longitude seventy- six degrees thirteen minutes forty-six seconds ; thence crossing the waters of the Chesapeake Bay, by a line running north sixty-five degrees thirty minutes east, about nine and a half nautical miles, to a point on the western shore of Smiths Island, at the north end of Sassafras Hammock, in latitude thirty-seven degrees fifty- seven minutes thirteen seconds, longitude seventy-six degrees two minutes fifty-two seconds ; thence across Smith's Island south eighty-eight degrees thirty minutes east, five thousand six hundred and twenty yards, to the center of Horse Hammock, on the eastern shore of Smith's Island, in latitude thirty-seven degrees fifty- seven minutes eight seconds, longitude seventyfive degrees fifty-nine minutes twenty seconds ; thence south seventynine degrees thirty minutes east, four thousand eight hundred and eighty yards, to a point marked A on the accompanying map, in the middle of Tangier Sound, in latitude thirty-seven degrees fifty- six minutes forty-two seconds, longitude seventy- five degrees fifty-six minutes twenty-three seconds, said point bearing from Janes Island light south fifty-four degrees west, and distant from that light three thousand five hundred and sixty yards ; thence south ten degrees thirty minutes west, four thousand seven hundred and forty yards, by a line dividing the waters of Tangier Sound , to a point where it intersects the straight line from
Smith's Point to Watkin's Point said point of intersection being in latitude thirty-seven degrees fifty- four minutes twenty-one seconds, longitude seventy-five degrees fifty-six minutes fifty-five seconds , bearing from Jane's Island light south twenty-nine degrees west, and from Horse Hammock south thirty-four degrees thirty minutes east; this point of intersection is marked B on the accompanying map; thence north eighty-five degrees

minutes thirty- eight seconds, longitude seventy-five degrees forty-seven minutes fifty seconds ; thence by a line dividing the waters of Pocomoke Sound, north forty- seven degrees thirty minutes east, five thousand two hundred and twenty yards, to a point in said sound marked D on the accompanying map, in latitude thirty-seven degrees fifty-six minutes twenty-five seconds, longitude seventy- five degrees forty- five minutes twenty- six seconds ; thence following the middle of the Pocomoke River by a line of irregular curves, as laid down on the accompanying map, until it intersects the westward protraction of the boundary line marked by Scarborough and Calvert, May twenty- eighth, eighteen hundred and sixty-eight, at a point in the middle of the Pocomoke River and in the latitude thirty-seven degrees fifty-nine minutes thirty-seven seconds, longitude seventy- five degrees thirty-seven minutes four seconds ; thence by the Scarborough and Calvert line, which runs five degrees fifteen minutes north of east, to the Atlantic Ocean : the latitudes, longitudes, courses, and distances here given have been measured upon the Coast Chart, number thirty-three, of the United States Coast Survey (sheet number three, Chesapeake Bay) which is herewith filed as part of this award and explanatory thereof; the original charter line is marked upon the said map and shaded in blue ; the present line of boundary, as ascertained and determined, is also marked and shaded in red , while the yellow indicates the line referred to in the compact of seventeen hundred and eighty-five, between Smith's Point and Watkin's Point ; in further explanation of this award, the arbitrators deem it proper to add that-
" First. The measurements being taken and places fixed according to

the Coast Survey, we have come as near to perfect mathematical accu-
racy as in the nature of things is possible ; but in case of any inaccuracy in the described course or length of a line or in the latitude or longitude
of a place, the natural objects called for must govern. "Second. The middle thread of Pocomoke River is equi-distant as
nearly as may be between the two shores without considering arms, inlets , creeks, or affluents as parts of the river, but measuring the shore lines from headland to headland.
" Third. The low-water mark on the Potomac, to which Virginia has a right in the soil, is to be measured by the same rule, that is to say, from low-water mark at one headland to low-water mark at another, without following indentations, bays, creeks, inlets, or affluent rivers.
" Fourth. Virginia is entitled not only to full dominion over the soil to low-water mark on the south shore of the Potomac, but has a right to such use of the river beyond the line of low-water mark as may be necessary to the full enjoyment of her riparian ownership, without impeding the navigation or otherwise interfering with the proper use of it by Maryland, agreeably to the compact of seventeen hundred and eightyfive.

porated in a special account, in which is shown, in francs and centimes, the annual amount of transit payment accruing to each office, by multiplying the totals by 12. The duty of preparing this account devolves upon the creditor office, which transmits it to the debtor office.
2. The balance resulting from the reciprocal accounts between two offices is paid by the debtor office to the creditor office in effective francs, and by means of bills drawn upon the capital, or upon a commercial place of the latter office.
3. The preparation , transmission , and payment of the accounts of the expenses of transit belonging to a period of service must be effected with the least possible delay, and at the latest, before the expiration of the first six months of the following period of service. When this time has passed, the amounts due by one office to another office are subject to interest at the rate of five per cent. per annum, dating from the day of the expiration of the said delay.
4. Nevertheless, the option is reserved to the offices interested to make, by mutual agreement, other arrangements than those which are set forth in the present Article.

1. Les frais communs du Bureau
international ne doivent pas dépasser, par année, la somme de 100,000 francs, non compris les frais spéciaux auxquels donne lieu la réunion d'un congrès ou d'une conférence.
2. L'Administration des Postes suisses surveille les dépenses du Bureau international, fait les avances nécessaires et établit le compte annuel, qui est communiqué à toutes les autres administrations.

3. Pour la répartition des frais,

les pays de l'Union sont divisés en sept classes, contribuant chacune

dans la proportion d'un certain

nombre d'unités, savoir :

1re classe · 20 66

1. The ordinary expenses of the International Bureau expenses.
International Bureau must not exceed the sum of 100,000 francs an-
nually, not including the special expenses to which the meeting of a Congress or of a Conference may give rise.
2. The Administration of the

Swiss Post Office superintends the expenses of the International Bureau, makes the necessary advances, and prepares the annual account, which is communicated to all the other Administrations.
3. For the division of the ex-

penses, the countries of the Union are divided into seven classes, each contributing in the proportion of a certain number of units, viz :

1st class 2nd 66 3rd 66 4th 66 5th 66 6th 66 7th 66

25 units. - 20 66
15 66 10 66
5 66 3 66 1 66



4. Ces coefficients sont multipliés par le nombre des pays de chaque classe, et la somme des produits ainsi obtenus fournit le nombre d'unités par lequel la dépense to tale doit être divisée. Le quotient donne le montant de l'unité de dépense.
5. Les pays de l'Union sont classés ainsi qu'il suit, en vue de la répartition des frais :
1re classe : Allemagne, AutricheHongrie, États-Unis d'Amérique, France, Inde britannique, ensemble des autres colonies britanniques moins le Canada, Grande-Bretagne, Italie, Russie, Turquie ;

4 classe : Danemark, Norvége, XX- 49

4. These coefficients are multiplied by the number of countries of each class, and the total of the products thus obtained furnishes the number of units by which the total expense is to be divided. The quotient gives the amount of the unit of expense.
5. The countries of the Union are
classified as follows, in view of the division of the expenses :
1st class : Germany, AustriaHungary, United States of America, France, British India, the whole of the other British colonies except Canada, Great Britain, Italy, Russia, Turkey.

A PROCLAMATION.

Whereas a convention between the United States of America and
His Majesty the Emperor of Japan, revising certain portions of existing commercial treaties and further extending commercial intercourse between the United States and Japan, was concluded and signed by their respective plenipotentiaries at the city of Washington on the twenty-fifth day of July, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and seventy-eight, the English text of which convention is, word for word, as follows:

Preamble.

Convention revising certain portions of existing commercial treaties and further extending commercial intercourse between the United States and Japan.
The President of the United States of America, and His Majesty the Contracting parEnfperor of Japan, both animated with the desire of maintaining the ties. good relations which have so happily subsisted between their respective countries, and wishing to strengthen, if possible, the bond of friendship, and to extend and consolidate commercial intercourse between the two countries by means of an additional convention , have for that purpose named as their respective plenipotentiaries ; that is to say ; the President of the United States, William Maxwell Evarts, Secretary of State of the United States, and His Majesty the Emperor of Japan, Jushie Yoshida Kiyonari, of the Order of the Rising Sun, and of the Third Class, and His Majesty's Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the United States of America, who, after reciprocal communication of their full powers, found in good and due form, have agreed upon the following articles :

ARTICLE I.

It is agreed by the high contracting parties that the Tariff Convention , Conventions of
signed at Yedo on the 25th day of June, 1866, or the 13th of the 5th 1866 and 1858 annulled.
month of the second year of Keio, by the respective representatives of the United States, Great Britain , France and Holland on the one hand , and Japan on the other, together with the schedules of tariff on imports and exports and the bonded warehouse regulations, both of which are attached to the said convention , shall hereby be annulled and become inoperative as between the United States and Japan under the condition expressed in Article X. of this present convention ; and all such provisions of the treaty of 1858, or the fifth year of Ansei, signed at Yedo, as appertain to the regulations of harbors, customs and taxes, as well as the whole of the trade-regulations, which are attached to the said treaty of 1858, or the fifth year of Ansei, shall also cease to operate.
It is further understood and agreed that from the time when this present convention shall take effect, the United States will recognize the exclusive power and right of the Japanese government to adjust the

ARTICLE II.

Import duties.

It is, however, further agreed that no other or higher duties shall be imposed on the importation into Japan of all articles of merchandise from the United States, than are or may be imposed upon the like articles of any other foreign country ; and if the Japanese government should prohibit the exportation from, or importation into, its dominions of any particular article or articles, such prohibition shall not be discriminatory against the products, vessels or citizens of the United States.

ARTICLE III.

Export duties .

It is further agreed, that, as the United States charge no export duties on merchandise shipped to Japan, no export duties on merchandise shipped in the latter country for the United States shall be charged after this treaty shall go into effect.

ARTICLE IV.

Forfeitures penalties.

and It is further stipulated and agreed, that, so long as the first three sentences which are comprised in the first paragraph of article VI. of the treaty of 1858, or the fifth year of Ansei, shall be in force, all claims by the Japanese government for forfeitures or penalties for violations of such existing treaty, as well as for violations of the customs, bondedwarehouse and harbor regulations, which may, under this convention, from time to time, be established by that government, shall be sued for in the consular courts of the United States, whose duty it shall be to try each and every case fairly and render judgment in accordance with the provisions of such treaty and of such regulations ; and the amount of all forfeitures and fines shall be delivered to the Japanese authorities.

ARTICLE V.

Coasting trade.

It is understood and declared by the high contracting parties, that the right of controlling the coasting trade of Japan belongs solely, and shall be strictly reserved, to the government of that Empire.

ARTICLE VI .

Coasting trade. Port charges.

It is, however, agreed, that vessels of the United States arriving at any port of Japan open to foreign commerce, may unload, in conformity with the customs laws of that country, such portions of their cargoes as may be desired, and that they may depart with the remainder, without paying any duties, imposts or charges whatsoever, except for that part which shall have been landed, and which shall be so noted on the manifest. The said vessels may continue their voyage to one or more other open ports of Japan, there to land the part or residue of their cargoes, desired to be landed at such port or ports. It is understood, however, that all duties, imposts or charges whatsoever, which are or may become chargeable upon the vessels themselves, are to be paid only at the first port where they shall break bulk or unload part of their cargo ; and that at any subsequent port used in the same voyage only the local port charges shall be exacted for the use of such port.

ARTICLE VII.
Additional open In view of the concessions made by the United States in regard to the ports.

ARTICLE VIII .

It is also agreed that, as the occasion for Article V. of the treaty of Article V. of 1858, or the fifth year of Ansei, between the two countries is considered treaty of 1858. to have passed away, that article shall, after the present treaty shall have gone into effect, be regarded as no longer binding.
ARTICLE IX.

It is further agreed, that such of the provisions of the treaties or con- Conflicting proventions heretofore concluded between the two countries and not herein visions.

expressly abrogated, as conflict with any provisions of the present convention are hereby revoked and annulled ; that the present convention shall be considered to be and form a part of the existing treaties between the two countries ; that the revision of such portions of the said treaties as are not modified or revoked by the present convention, as also the revision of the present convention itself, may be demanded hereafter by either of the high contracting parties ; and that this convention, as well as the previous treaties as modified thereby, shall continue in force until, upon such a revision of the whole, or any part thereof, it shall be otherwise provided.
ARTICLE X.

Oct. 29, 1877.

The completed circle of summer and winter, seed-time and harvest, has brought us to the accustomed season at which a religious people celebrates with praise and thanksgiving the enduring mercy of Almighty God. This devout and public confession of the constant dependence of man upon the Divine favor for all the good gifts of life and health , and peace and happiness, so early in our history made the habit of our people, finds in the survey of the past year new grounds for its joyful and grateful manifestation .
In all the blessings which depend upon benignant seasons this has indeed been a memorable year. Over the wide territory of our country, with all its diversity of soil and climate and products, the earth has yielded a bountiful return to the labor of the husbandman . The health of the people has been blighted by no prevalent or wide-spread diseases. No great disasters of shipwreck upon our coasts , or to our commerce on the seas, have brought loss and hardship to merchants or mariners, and clouded the happiness of the community with sympathetic sorrow.
In all that concerns our strength and peace and greatness as a nation ;

Preamble.

PROCLAMATIONS.

in all that touches the permanence and security of our government, and the beneficent institutions on which it rests ; in all that affects the char-

acter and dispositions of our people, and tests our capacity to enjoy and uphold the equal and free condition of society, now permanent and universal throughout the land, the experience of the last year is conspicuously marked by the protecting providence of God, and is full of promise and hope for the coming generations.
Under a sense of these infinite obligations to the great Ruler of times and seasons and events, let us humbly ascribe it to our own faults and frailties if, in any degree, that perfect concord and happiness, peace and justice, which such great mercies should diffuse through the hearts and lives of our people, do not altogether and always and everywhere prevail. Let us with one spirit and with one voice lift up praise and

thanksgiving to God for his manifold goodness to our land , his manifest care for our nation . Appointing Now, therefore, I, RUTHERFORD B. HAYES , President of the United Thursday, Novem- States, do appoint Thursday, the twenty-ninth day of November next, ber 29 , 1877 , ThanksgivingDay, as a Day of National Thanksgiving and Prayer ; and I earnestly recom mend that, withdrawing themselves from secular cares and labors, the people of the United States do meet together on that day in their re-
spective places of worship , there to give thanks and praise to Almighty God for his mercies , and to devoutly beseech their continuance.
In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand , and caused the scal of the United States to be affixed.

Done at the city of Washington this twenty- ninth day of October, in
the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and seventy-
[SEAL. ] seven, and of the Independence of the United States the one hundred and second.

A PROCLAMATION.
Whereas it is provided in the laws of the United States that whenever, by reason of unlawful obstructions , combinations or assemblages of persons, or rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States, it shall become impracticable, in the judgment of the President, to enforce by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings the laws of the United States within any State or Territory, it shall be lawful for the President to call forth the militia of any or all the States, and to employ such parts of the land and naval forces of the United States as he may deem necessary to enforce the faithful execution of the laws of the United States, or to suppress such rebellion , in whatever State or Territory thereof the laws of the United States may be forcibly opposed or the execution thereof forcibly obstructed ;
And whereas it has been made to appear to me that by reason of unlawful combinations and assemblages of persons in arms, it has become impracticable to enforce, by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings, the laws of the United States within the Territory of New Mexico, and especially within Lincoln County therein ; and that the laws ofthe United States have been therein forcibly opposed and the execution thereof for cibly resisted ;

PROCLAMATIONS .

807

And whereas the laws of the United States require that whenever it
may be necessary, in the judgment of the President, to use the military force for the purpose of enforcing the faithful execution of the laws of the United States, he shall forthwith, by proclamation, command such insurgents to disperse and retire peaceably to their respective abodes, within a limited time :

Now, therefore, I, Rutherford B. Hayes , President of the United States Warning all per-

do hereby admonish all good citizens of the United States, and especially svoionlsetnocedesiinst Nfreowm of the Territory of New Mexico against aiding, countenancing, abetting Mexico.

or taking part in any such unlawful proceedings , and I do hereby warn all persons engaged in or connected with said obstruction of the laws, to disperse and retire peaceably to their respective abodes on or before noon of the thirteenth day of October instant.

In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.

Done at the city of Washington this seventh day of October in the year of our Lord eighteen hundred and seventy-eight, and of

A PROCLAMATION.

The recurrence of that season at which it is the habit of our people to make devout and public confession of their constant dependence upon the Divine favor for all the good gifts of life and happiness and of public peace and prosperity, exhibits, in the record of the year, abundant reasons for our gratitude and thanksgiving.
Exuberant harvests, productive mines, ample crops of the staples of trade and manufactures, have enriched the country.
The resources, thus furnished to our reviving industry and expanding commerce, are hastening the day when discords and distresses, through the length and breadth of the land , will, under the continued favor of Providence, have given way to confidence, and energy and assured prosperity.
Peace with all nations has been maintained unbroken, domestic tran-

Preamble.

quillity has prevailed , and the institutions of liberty and justice which the wisdom and virtue of our fathers established, remain the glory and defence of their children.

The general prevalence of the blessings of health through our wide

land, has made more conspicuous the sufferings and sorrows, which the

dark shadow of pestilence has cast upon a portion of our people. This

heavy affliction, even, the Divine Ruler has tempered to the suffering

communities in the universal sympathy and succor which have flowed

to their relief, and the whole nation may rejoice in the unity of spirit in

our people by which they cheerfully share one another's burdens.

Now, therefore, I , Rutherford B. Hayes, President of the United States, Thanksgiving

do appoint Thursday, the 28th day of November, next, as a Day of Na

Day, Thursday, November 28, 1878.

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. A PROCLAMATION.

Preamble.

Whereas the final adjournment of the Forty-fifth Congress without making the usual and necessary appropriations for the legislative, executive and judicial expenses of the Government for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1880, and without making the usual and necessary appropria

tions for the support of the Army for the same fiscal year, presents an

extraordinary occasion requiring the President to exercise the power

vested in him by the Constitution to convene the Houses of Congress in

anticipation of the day fixed by law for their next meeting :

Convening Con- Now, therefore , I, Rutherford B. Hayes, President of the United

gress in extra ses-

sion.

States, do, by virtue of the power to this end in me vested by the Con

stitution , convene both Houses of Congress to assemble at their respect

ive chambers at 12 o'clock noon on Tuesday the eighteenth day of

March instant, then and there to consider and determine such measures

as, in their wisdom, their duty and the welfare of the people may seem to demand.

In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.

Done at the city of Washington this fourth day of March, in the year of our Lord, one thousand eight hundred and seventy-nine, and
