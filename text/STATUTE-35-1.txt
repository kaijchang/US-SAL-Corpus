[ The Ambassador ofGreat Britain on Special Mission to the Secretary of State.]

BRITISH EMBASSY

Washington, June 3, 1918. SIR:

With reference to the Military Service Convention between the United States and

Great Britain signed today, I am instructed by His Majesty's Government to explain why the proviso to Article One does not limit the military service of citizens of the United States in Great Britain to those of the ages specified in the laws of the United States prescribing compulsory military service, as requested by the United States Government. The reason for the omission of this clause in the

proviso is a desire to avoid the delay that would be involved in modifying the Military Service Acts 1916 to 1918, which control the operation of any convention of this
character. I beg you, therefore, to be good enough not to press this proposal. The effect of these Acts is to make United States citizens in Great Britain under this

convention liable to military service between the ages of 18 and 49 both inclusive . The limitation of the ages of United States citizens in Great Britain for the purpose

of military service to those prescribed in the laws of the United States relating to compulsory military service may, however, be attained without amendment of these

Acts by exercise of the United States of its right of exemption under Article Three.

His Majesty's Government understand, therefore, that the United States Government will exercise their right under Article Three to exempt from compulsory military service in Great Britain all citizens of the United States in Great Britain, out-

side the ages specified in the laws of the United States prescribing compulsory military service .

I have the honor to be with the highest consideration, Sir, Your most obedient, humble servant,

DEPARTMENT OF STATE , Washington, June 3, 1918.

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of Your Excellency's note of this

date in regard to the Military Service Convention between the United States and Great Britain signed today, in which you state that you are instructed to explain

why the proviso to Article One does not limit the military service of citizens of the United States in Great Britain to those of the ages specified in the laws of the United

States prescribing compulsory military service as requested by the United States Government. In explanation Your Excellency states as follows:

"The reason for the omission of this clause in the proviso is a desire to avoid the delay which would be involved in modifying the Military Service Acts 1916 to 1918, which control the operation of any convention of this character. I beg

you therefore to be good enough not to press this proposal . " The effect of these Acts is to make United States citizens in Great Britain

under this convention liable to military service between the ages of 18 and 49

years, both inclusive. The limitation of the ages of United States citizens in

Great Britain for the purposes of military service to those prescribed in the laws of the United States relating to compulsory military service, may, however, be attained without amendment of these Acts by the exercise by the United States

of its right of exemption under Article Three."

Your Excellency adds that " His Majesty's Government understand, therefore that the United States
Government will exercise its right under Article Three to exempt from compulsory military service in Great Britain all citizens of the United States in Great

Britain, outside the ages specified in the laws of the United States prescribing compulsory military service."

In reply I have the honor to inform your Excellency that the Government of the

United States is pleased to accept this explanation of said Article One and in lieu of a clause in this Article limiting the military service of citizens of the United States

in Great Britain to those of the ages specified in the laws of the United States prescribing compulsory military service to exercise its right under Article Three to

exempt from compulsory military service in Great Britain all citizens ofthe United States in Great Britain outside of the ages specified in the laws of the United States

prescribing compulsory military service. I have the honor to be, with the highest consideration ,

If it is determined by the drawing that a declaratory statement shall be acted upon and disposed of before a homestead application for the same land, the homestead applicant shall be allowed thirty days from receipt of notice within which to advise the Register and Receiver whether to allow or to reject the application. If an applicant, or a declarant or his agent, fails to notify the Register and Receiver within the time allowed what disposition to make of the application or statement, it will be rejected as to all the land applied for. Homestead applications and declaratory statements which are presented after April 30, 1917 , will be received and noted in the order of their filing, and will be acted upon and disposed of in the usual manner after all such applications and statements presented on or before that date have been acted upon and disposed of.

When a homestead application is allowed in whole or in part, the sums required as fees, commissions and purchase money will be properly applied, and any sum in excess of the required amount will be returned to the applicant. When a declaratory statement is allowed in whole or in part, the sum which will be required as purchase money if entry is made under the declaratory statement will be held until entry has been allowed under the statement or the time has expired within which entry may be made and any sum in excess of the required amount will be returned to the declarant.

the soil and man the factories are no less a part of the army that is

France than the men beneath the battle flags. It must be so with

us. It is not an army that we must shape and train for war; it is a nation. To this end our people must draw close in one compact front

against a common foe. But this can not be if each man pursues a private purpose. All must pursue one purpose. The nation needs all men ; but it needs each man, not in the field that will most pleasure him, but in the endeavor that will best serve the common good.

Thus , though a sharpshooter pleases to operate a trip-hammer for the forging of great guns, and an expert machinist desires to march with

the flag, the nation is being served only when the sharpshooter marches and the machinist remains at his levers . The whole nation must be

a team in which each man shall play the part for which he is best

fitted . To this end, Congress has provided that the nation shall be

organized for war by selection and that each man shall be classified

for service in the place to which it shall best serve the general good

to call him.

Duty incumbent

upon the people.

The significance of this can not be overstated . It is a new thing

in our history and a landmark in our progress . It is a new manner

of accepting and vitalizing our duty to give ourselves with thoughtful devotion to the common purpose of us all. It is in no sense a conscription of the unwilling ; it is rather, selection from a nation which has volunteered in mass. It is no more a choosing of those who shall march with the colors than it is a selection of those who shall

serve an equally necessary and devoted purpose in the industries

that lie behind the battle line.

selves for assignment to their tasks . It is for that reason destined to

be remembered as one of the most conspicuous moments in our

history. It is nothing less than the day upon which the manhood of the country shall step forward in one solid rank in defense of the ideals

to which this nation is consecrated . It is important to those ideals

no less than to the pride of this generation in manifesting its devotion

to them, that there be no gaps in the ranks .

sion of its significance and that we accord to it the honor and the

meaning that it deserves. Our industrial need prescribes that it be

not made a technical holiday, but the stern sacrifice that is before us,

urges that it be carried in all our hearts as a great day of patriotic

devotion and obligation when the duty shall lie upon every man,

whether he is himself to be registered or not, to see to it that the

name of every male person of the designated ages is written on these

lists of honor.

Civil amnesty pardon.
Preamble.
Post, p. 1690.

and Whereas a practice has existed for many years among the judges of certain United States courts of suspending either the imposition or the execution of sentences whenever, in their judgment, the circumstances warranted it, which practice is illegal as has been held by the Supreme Court of the United States in a case entitled " Ex parte United States, petitioner," known as the Killits case, decided December 4, 1916 ; and

Whereas the practice was widespread, and many thousands of

persons are now at liberty under such suspensions, never having served any portion of the sentences duly authorized and required by the statutes ; and

Whereas many of these persons are leading blameless lives and have reestablished themselves in the confidence of their fellow citizens, and it is believed that the enforcement of the law at this

late date would , in most instances, be productive of no good results ; and

Whereas the Supreme Court of the United States, in recognition

of the necessity for meeting this situation, has stayed the mandate
in the Killits case until the end of the present term, to wit, until
about June 15 , 1917 : Granted to persons Now, therefore, be it known that I, Woodrow Wilson , President under certain suspendUenditseedntSetnacteess, Coetucr.t,s.of of the United States of America, in consideration of the premises,

as aforesaid, where the sentences imposed were less than the period

between the date of imposition and June 15 , 1917, and to all persons,

defendants in said courts, in cases where pleas of guilty were entered

hereby authorized and empowered , subject to review by the Secretary of Commerce, to refuse clearance to any such vessel, domestic or foreign, for which clearance is required by law, and by formal notice served upon the owners , master, or person or persons in command or charge of any domestic vessel for which clearance is not required by law, to forbid the departure of such vessel from the port, and it shall thereupon be unlawful for such vessel to depart.

judges have no authority to suspend sentence or the imposition thereof; and

Whereas, many judges did not claim such power and others both claimed and exercised it , with the result that there was a lack of uniformity in the administration of the criminal laws, and a large number of persons who had been convicted and were required by acts of Congress to be sentenced and committed had escaped punishment without legal disposition of their cases ; and
Whereas, in many instances, defendants in such courts, who had

been improperly at large for a number of years, under the circumstances recited, had reestablished themselves in the respective communities wherein they lived ; and
Whereas, the object of the aforesaid Proclamation was to meet

this situation justly, and the amnesty proposed therein was offered to such defendants and each of them with reference to that object alone ;

Liberty Day. Preamble.

The Second Liberty Loan gives the people of the United States

another opportunity to lend their funds to their Government to sus-

tain their country at war. The might of the United States is being mobilized and organized to strike a mortal blow at autocracy in

defense of outraged American rights and of the cause of Liberty.

Billions of dollars are required to arm, feed and clothe the brave men

who are going forth to fight our country's battles and to assist the nations with whom we are making common cause against a common

foe. To subscribe to the Liberty Loan is to perform a service of patriotism.

Wednesday, October NOW, THEREFORE , I , WOODROW WILSON, PRESI24, 1917, appointed for DENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, do appoint public assemblages to

Gploevdegrensmuepnpto.rt to the Wednesday, the twenty-fourth of October, as Liberty Day, and

urge and advise the people to assemble in their respective communi-

ties and pledge to one another and to the Government that repre-

sents them the fullest measure of financial support. On the afternoon of that day I request that patriotic meetings be held in every city, town and hamlet throughout the land , under the general direction of the Secretary of the Treasury and the immediate direction

of the Liberty Loan Committees which have been organized by the

Federal Reserve Banks. The people responded nobly to the call of the First Liberty Loan with an oversubscription of more than fifty per cent. Let the response to the Second Loan be even greater

and let the amount be so large that it will serve as an assurance of unequalled support to hearten the men who are to face the fire of

battle for us. Let the result be so impressive and emphatic that it

will echo throughout the Empire of our enemy as an index of what

America intends to do to bring this war to a victorious conclusion .

A PROCLAMATION .

Thanksgiving 1917.
Preamble.

Day, It has long been the honored custom of our people to turn in the fruitful autumn of the year in praise and thanksgiving to Almighty God for His many blessings and mercies to us as a nation . That custom we can follow now even in the midst of the tragedy of a world shaken by war and immeasurable disaster, in the midst of sorrow and great peril, because even amidst the darkness that has
gathered about us we can see the great blessings God has bestowed upon us, blessings that are better than mere peace of mind and pros-
perity of enterprise. We have been given the opportunity to serve mankind as we once
served ourselves in the great day of our Declaration of Independence, by taking up arms against a tyranny that threatened to master and debase men everywhere and joining with other free peoples in demanding for all the nations of the world what we then demanded and
obtained for ourselves . In this day of the revelation of our duty not only to defend our own rights as a nation but to defend also the rights of free men throughout the world, there has been vouchsafed us in full and inspiring measure the resolution and spirit of united action . We have been brought to one mind and purpose. A new vigor of common counsel and common action has been revealed in
us. We should especially thank God that in such circumstances, in the midst of the greatest enterprise the spirits of men have ever entered upon, we have, if we but observe a reasonable and practicable
economy, abundance with which to supply the needs of those associated with us as well as our own . A new light shines about us.
The great duties of a new day awaken a new and greater national

PROCLAMATIONS , 1917.

spirit in us. We shall never again be divided or wonder what stuff we are made of.
And while we render thanks for these things let us pray Almighty God that in all humbleness of spirit we may look always to Him for guidance; that we may may be kept constant in the spirit and purpose of service ; that by His grace our minds may be directed and our hands strengthened ; and that in His good time liberty and security and peace and the comradeship of a common justice may be vouchsafed all the nations of the earth .
WHEREFORE, I , Woodrow Wilson, President of the United , Thursday, Novem ber 29, 1917, appointed
States of America, do hereby designate Thursday, the twenty-ninth athsanaksgdiavyingof. general day of November next as a day of thanksgiving and prayer, and invite the people throughout the land to cease upon that day from their ordinary occupations and in their several homes and places of worship to render thanks to God, the great ruler of nations .

through his agent, shall be allowed thirty days from receipt of notice

within which to notify the Register and Receiver, what disposition

to make thereof. During such time, he may request that the appli-

applied for; or he may apply to have the application or statement

amended to include other land which is subject to entry and to inclu-

sion in his application or statement, provided he is the prior applicant.

If it is determined by the drawing that a declaratory statement shall

be acted upon and disposed of before a homestead application for the

same land, the homestead applicant shall be allowed thirty days from

receipt of notice within which to advise the Register and Receiver

whether to reject his application, or to allow it subject to the declara-

tory statement. If an applicant, or a declarant, or his agent, fails to

notify the Register or Receiver what disposition to make of the appli-

cation or statement, within the time allowed, it will be rejected as to

all the land applied for. Homestead applications and declaratory

statements which are presented after April 20, 1918 , will be received

though the application is rejected, and such fees will be properly applied when the statement is filed . When a homestead application

is allowed in whole or in part, the sums required as fees, commissions,

and purchase money will be properly applied , and any sum in excess

of the required amount will be returned to the applicant. When a declaratory statement is allowed in whole or in part, the sum which

will be required as purchase money if entry is made under the declaratory statement will be held until entry has been allowed under the

statement or the time has expired within which entry may be made,

and any sum in excess of the required amount will be returned to

the declarant. The moneys held will not be returned until the time

has expired within which entry may be made under the statement

but will be returned as soon as possible thereafter if entry is not made.

Moneys tendered with applications and statements which are rejected

in whole, except fees for filing declaratory statements, will be re-

turned . If an applicant or declarant fails to secure all the land

applied for and amends his application or statement to embrace other

lands, the moneys theretofore tendered will be applied on account of

the required payment under the amended application . If it is not

sufficient, the applicant or declarant will be required to pay the

deficiency, and if it is more than sufficient, the excess will be re-

turned . Money returned to applicants or declarants will be re-

Report of War Labor Conference Board.

The following report and recommendations are presented by the War Labor Conference Board, representing employers and employees, appointed in accordance with the suggestion of Secretary of Labor William B. Wilson, to aid in the formation of a National labor program for the period of the war:

Honorable WILLIAM B. WILSON, Secretary of Labor.

WASHINGTON, D. C. , March 29, 1918.

SIR: The Commission of representatives of employers and workers, selected in accord with the suggestion of your letter of January 28, 1918, to aid in the formulation, in the present emergency, of a National labor program, present to you, as a result their conferences, the following:
(a) That there be created, for the period of the war, a National War Labor Board of the same number and to be selected in the same manner and by the same agencies as the commission making this recommendation:
(b) That the functions and powers of the National Board shall be as follows: 1. To bring about a settlement, by mediation and conciliation of every contro-
versy arising between employers and workers in the field of production necessary for the effective conduct of the war.

2. To do the same thing in similar controversies in other fields of national activity, delays and obstructions in which may, in the opinion of the National Board, affect detrimentally such production.
3. To provide such machinery by direct appointment, or otherwise, for selection of committees or Boards to sit in various parts of the country where controversies arise, to secure settlement by local mediation and conciliation .
4. To summon the parties to the controversy for hearing and action by the National Board in case of failure to secure settlement by local mediation and conciliation .
(c) If the sincere and determined effort of the National Board shall fail to bring about a voluntary settlement, and the members of the Board shall be unable unani-
mously to agree upon a decision, then and in that case and only as a last resort, an umpire appointed in the manner provided in the next paragraph shall hear and finally decide the controversy under simple rules of procedure prescribed by the National Board .

(d) The members of the National Board shall choose the umpire by unanimous vote. Failing such choice, the name of the umpire shall be drawn by lot from a list of ten suitable and disinterested persons to be nominated for the purpose by the President of the United States.
(e) The National Board shall hold its regular meetings in the city of Washington, with power to meet at any other place convenient for the Board and the occasion.
(f) The National Board may alter its methods and practice in settlement of controversies hereunder, from time to time as experience may suggest.
(g) The National Board shall refuse to take cognizance of a controversy between employer and workers in any field of industrial or other activity where there is by agreement or Federal law a means of settlement which has not been invoked.

1768

PROCLAMATIONS , 1918.
(h) The place of each member of the National Board unavoidably detained from attending one or more of its sessions may be filled by a substitute to be named by such member as his regular substitute. The substitute shall have the same representative character as his principal.
(i) The National Board shall have power to appoint a Secretary, and to create such other clerical organization under it as may be in its judgment necessary for the discharge of its duties.
(j) The national Board may apply to the Secretary of Labor for authority to use the machinery of the Department in its work of conciliation and mediation.
(k) The action of the National Board may be invoked in respect to controversies within its jurisdiction, by the Secretary of Labor or by either side in a controversy or its duly authorized representative. The Board, after summary consideration, may refuse further hearing if the case is not of such character or importance to justify it.
(1) In the appointment of committees of its own members to act for the Board in general or local matters, and in the creation of local committees, the employers and the workers shall be equally represented.
(m) The representatives of the public in the Board shall preside alternately at successive sessions of the Board or as agreed upon.
(n) The Board in its mediating and conciliatory action, and the umpire in his consideration of a controversy , shall be governed by the following principles:
PRINCIPLES AND POLICIES TO GOVERN RELATIONS BETWEEN WORKERS AND EMPLOYEES IN WAR INDUSTRIES FOR THE DURATION OF THE WAR.
THERE SHOULD BE NO STRIKES OR LOCKOUTS DURING THE WAR.
RIGHT TO ORGANIZE 1. The right of workers to organize in trade unions and bargain collectively,
through chosen representatives, is recognized and affirmed . This right shall not be denied, abridged, or interfered with bythe employers in any manner whatsoever.
2. The right of employers to organize in associations of groups and to bargain collectively, through chosen representatives, is recognized and affirmed. This right shall not be denied, abridged or interfered with by the workers inany manner whatsoever.
3. Employers should not discharge workers for membership in trade unions, nor for legitimate trade union activities.
4. The workers, in the exercise of their right to organize, shall not use coercive measures of any kind to induce persons to join their organizations, nor to induce employers to bargain or deal therewith. EXISTING CONDITIONS
1. In establishments where the union shop exists the same shall continue and the union standards as to wages, hours of labor and other conditions of employment shall be maintained .
2. In establishments where union and non-union men and women now work together, and the employer meets only with employees or representatives engaged in said establishments, the continuance of such condition shall not be deemed a grievance. This declaration, however, is not intended in any manner to deny the right, or discourage the practice of the formation of labor unions, or the joining of the same by the workers in said establishments, as guaranteed in the last paragraph, nor to prevent the War Labor Board from urging, or any umpire from granting, under the machinery herein provided , improvement of their situation in the matter of wages, hours of labor, or other conditions, as shall be found desirable from time to time.
3. Established safe-guards and regulations for the protection of the health and safety of workers shall not be relaxed . WOMEN IN INDUSTRY
If it shall become necessary to employ women on work ordinarily performed by men, they must be allowed equal pay for equal work and must not be allotted tasks disproportionate to their strength. HOURS OF LABOR
The basic eight hour day is recognized as applying in all cases in which existing law requires it. In all other cases the question of hours of labor shall be settled with due regard to governmental necessities and the welfare, health and proper comfort of the workers. MAXIMUM PRODUCTION
The maximum production of all war industries should be maintained, and methods of work andoperation on the part of employers or workers which operate to delay or limit production, or which have a tendency to artificially increase the cost thereof, should be discouraged. MOBILIZATION OF LABOR
For the purpose of mobilizing the labor supply with a view to its rapid and effective distribution, a permanent list of the number of skilled and other workers

PROCLAMATIONS, 1918.

available in different parts of the nation shall be kept on file by the Department of Labor, the information to be constantly furnished:

1. By the trade unions. 2. By State employment bureaus and Federal agencies of like character. 3. By the managers and operators of industrial establishments throughout the

country . These agencies should be given opportunity to aid in the distribution of labor, as necessity demands.

CUSTOM OF LOCALITIES

In fixing wages, hours and conditions of labor regard should always be had to the labor standards, wage scales, and other conditions, prevailing in the localities affected .

THE LIVING WAGE

1. The right of all workers, including common laborers, to a living wage is hereby declared .

2. In fixing wages, minimum rates of pay shall be established which will insure

the subsistence of the worker and his family in health and reasonable comfort.

Red Cross Week. Preamble.

Inasmuch as the War Fund of 1917, so generously contributed by the American people to the American Red Cross for the administration of relief at home and abroad, has been practically exhausted by appropriations for the welfare of the men in our military and naval forces, and for those dependent upon them, and for the yet more urgent necessities of our Allies , military and civilian , who have long borne the brunt of war;
And, inasmuch as the American Red Cross has been recognized

by law and international convention as the public instrumentality for war relief ;

And, inasmuch as the year of our own participation in the war has

brought unprecedented demands upon the patriotism and liberality

of our people, and made evident the necessity of concentrating the

work of relief in one main organization which can respond effectively

and universally to the needs of humanity under stress of war ; And, inasmuch as the duration of the war and the closer and

closer cooperation of the American Red Cross with our own Army and Navy, with the governments of our Allies, and with foreign relief

organizations, have resulted in the discovery of new opportunities

of helpfulness under conditions which translate opportunity into duty ;

And, inasmuch as the American Red Cross War Council and its

of effort and sacrifice on the part of those, who, though not privileged to bear arms, are of one spirit, purpose, and determination with our warriors.

liberately ordained by those who were then responsible for the safety

and defence of the Nation that the duty of military service should rest upon all able-bodied men between the ages of eighteen and forty-five.

We now accept and fulfill the obligation which they established, an obligation expressed in our national statutes from that time until now. We solemnly purpose a decisive victory of arms and deliberate-
ly to devote the larger part of the military man power of the Nation to the accomplishment of that purpose.
The younger men have from the first been ready to go . They have iceRseocfotghneityioounngoefrmseernv-. furnished voluntary enlistments out of all proportion to their numbers. Our military authorities regard them as having the highest
combatant qualities. Their youthful enthusiasm, their virile eagerness , their gallant spirit of daring make them the admiration of all
who see them in action. They covet not only the distinction of serving in this great war but also the inspiring memories which hundreds of thousands of them will cherish through the years to come, of a great

day and a great service for their country and for mankind. Opportunity now af-

they do. Having made a place for themselves in their respective communities, having assumed at home the graver responsibilities of

life in many spheres, looking back upon honorable records in civil and industrial life, they will realize as perhaps no others could,

how entirely their own fortunes and the fortunes of all whom they love are put at stake in this war for right, and will know that the very records they have made render this new duty the commanding duty

of their lives. They know how surely this is the Nation's war, how

imperatively it demands the mobilization and massing of all our
resources of every kind. They will regard this call as the supreme call of their day and will answer it accordingly.

But all must be registered in order that the selection for military service may be made intelligently and with full information. This will be our final demonstration of loyalty, democracy, and the will to win, our solemn notice to all the world that we stand absolutely together in a common resolution and purpose. It is the call to duty to which every true man in the country will respond with pride and with the consciousness that in doing so he plays his part in vindication of a great cause at whose summons every true heart offers its supreme service.

Thanksgiving Day,

1918.

It has long been our custom to turn in the autumn of the year in

Preamble.

praise and thanksgiving to Almighty God for His many blessings

and mercies to us as a nation. This year we have special and moving

cause to be grateful and to rejoice. God has in His good pleasure given us peace. It has not come as a mere cessation of arms, a mere

relief from the strain and tragedy of war. It has come as a great triumph of right. Complete victory has brought us, not peace alone, but the confident promise of a new day as well in which justice

shall replace force and jealous intrigue among the nations. Our gallant armies have participated in a triumph which is not marred

or stained by any purpose of selfish aggression . In a righteous cause

they have won immortal glory and have nobly served their nation

in serving mankind . God has indeed been gracious . We have cause for such rejoicing as revives and strengthens in us all the best tradi-

tions of our national history. A new day shines about us, in which our hearts take new courage and look forward with new hope to new

and greater duties .

PROCLAMATIONS, 1918.

1889

While we render thanks for these things, let us not forget to seek

the Divine guidance in the performance of those duties, and Divine

mercy and forgiveness for all errors of act or purpose, and pray that

in all that we do we shall strengthen the ties of friendship and mutual

respect upon which we must assist to build the new structure of

peace and good will among the nations.

Oyster Bay, New York, at 4:15 o'clock in the morning of January 6 , 1919. In his death the United States has lost one of its most dis-

tinguished and patriotic citizens, who had endeared himself to the people by his strenuous devotion to their interests and to the public interests of his country.
As president of the Police Board of his native city, as Member of the Legislature and Governor of his State, as Civil Service Commis-

sioner, as Assistant Secretary of the Navy, as Vice-President and as President of the United States, he displayed administrative powers of a signal order and conducted the affairs of these various offices with a concentration of effort and a watchful care which permitted no divergence from the line of duty he had definitely set for himself.

In the War with Spain, he displayed singular initiative and energy and distinguished himself among the commanders of the army in the field . As President he awoke the Nation to the dangers of private control which lurked in our financial and industrial systems . It

was by thus arresting the attention and stimulating the purpose of
the country that he opened the way for subsequent necessary and beneficent reforms.

His private life was characterized by a simplicity, a virtue and an

affection worthy of all admiration and emulation by the people of

America .
