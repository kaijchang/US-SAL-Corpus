In the Coral Sea and the Atlantic and Pacific, it is a mark of hope to our allies and of despair to our enemies . Our colors have found their way to the heart of the enemy over Berlin and Tokyo .
We know that our flag is not fighting alone. This year the flags of thirty-two United Nations are marching together, borne forward by the bravery of free men. Together they are the emblem of a gathering offensive that shall liberate the world. As brothers in arms, we of the United Nations have pledged to one another our mutual strength until total victory is won and peace assured.
Our armies, our navies, and our air forces are now perfecting the teamwork with our allies which shall, under God, bring victory in this great cause to which freedom-loving mankind has dedicated itself. Made strong by our common bonds, we shall face the fucure with resolution and rededicate ourselves to the achievement of permanent collaboration among nations and security for all men. For

THIRD WAR LOAN DRIVE

Recognizing the fact that in carrying the war into enemy territory , Third War Loan launching, Sept. 9,
we shall need greater amounts of money than any nation has ever 1943 . asked from its citizens in all history, I , FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT, President of the United States of America, do officially proclaim that on Thursday, the ninth of September, 1943, the Third War Loan shall be launched .
As Commander-in-Chief, I hereby invoke every citizen to give all possible aid and support to this Third War Loan drive, not only so that our financial goal may be reached, but to encourage and inspire those of our husbands and fathers and sons who are under fire on a dozen fronts all over the world . It is my earnest hope that every
American will realize that in buying War Bonds in this Third War Loan he has an opportunity to express voluntarily and under the guidance of his conscience, the extent to which he will " back the attack. "
The American people supported well the first and second War Loan drives and in fact did even more than was asked of them. Our
need for money now is greater than ever, and will continue to grow until the very day that Victory is won ; so we must ask far more sacrifice, far more cooperation than ever before.

FIRE PREVENTION WEEK, 1943

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA A PROCLAMATION

August 30, 1943 [No. 2592]

This Nation's war program is menaced by an alarming increase in
preventable fire losses. Since Pearl Harbor the destruction caused by fire in the United States has been comparable to the damage caused by all enemy bombing over England during the first two years of the war. The loss to this Nation is just as real as if the destruction had
been wrought by enemy bombers over America , or by saboteurs . These preventable fires are being measured in thousands of workers
killed and disabled ; vast destruction of critical raw materials, food ,

and other vital supplies for our armed forces and civilian population ; the ruin of war plants, factories, homes, and machinery- in many cases for the duration of the war. Fires are bringing costly delays in

the production and transportation of airplanes , ships, tanks , and guns delays that mean a postponement of victory and the lives of

many of our men on the fighting fronts .

Today it is vitally necessary that we prevent destructive fire. Every State in the Union shares this responsibility. Every commu-

nity must make an extra and thorough effort to detect and eliminate

fire hazards . Only by this united endeavor can America guard her productive power against fire and eliminate a major hazard that

threatens seriously to reduce supplies of war materials , food , clothing, and other essentials required by our fighting men overseas and by

our civilians at home. The cause was never so clear ; the need was

never so great.

Designation ofweek

NOW, THEREFORE , I , FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT , Presi- beginning Oct. 3, 1943,

dent of the United States of America , do hereby designate the week aWseeFki.re Prevention

beginning October 3, 1943 , as Fire Prevention Week. I earnestly

request the people of the country to take unusually active measures

during that week, and throughout the year, to conserve our human

and material resources from destruction by fire . I call upon State

and local governments, the Chamber of Commerce of the United

States , the National Fire Waste Council , upon all business and labor

organizations, the pulpit, educators, civic groups , the press, the radio , and the motion-picture industry to initiate programs that will vividly bring home to all our people the dangers of fire and the methods of

controlling it. Further, I direct the Office of Civilian Defense, the Department of Agriculture , the War Production Board , the protective

services of the War and Navy Departments, and other appropriate Federal agencies to lend their active support and assistance to the attainment of these objectives .

God's help to us has been great in this year of march toward worldwide liberty.

Our forges and hearths and mills have wrought well ; and our weapons have not failed . Our farmers, Victory gardeners, and crop volunteers have gathered and stored a heavy harvest in the barns and bins and cellars . Our total food production for the year is the greatest in the annals of our country.

For all these things we are devoutly thankful , knowing also that

At the end of the year 1943 , which has not only made manifest the devotion and courage of our nation's sons but has also crowned their
efforts with brilliant success on every battle front , it is fitting that we set aside a day of prayer to give thanks to Almighty God for His constant providence over us in every hour of national peace and national peril.
At the beginning of the new year 1944 , which now lies before us, it is fitting that we pray to be preserved from false pride of accomplishment and from willful neglect of the last measure of public and private sacrifice necessary to attain final victory and peace.

May we find in the infinite mercy of the God of our Fathers some measure of comfort for the personal anxieties of separation and anguish of bereavement .

[EXCHANGE OF NOTES ]

[Note inthe English and Chinese Languages From the Chinese Ambassador at Washington to the Secretary of State ]

CHINESE EMBASSY WASHINGTON

EXCELLENCY :

JANUARY 11 , 1943

Under instruction of my Government, I have the honor to state that in connection with the treaty signed today by the Government of the Republic of China and the Government of the United States of America, in which the Government of the United States of America relinquishes its extraterritorial and related special rights in China, it is the understanding of the Government of the Republic of China that the rights of the Government of the United States of America and of its nationals in regard to the systems of treaty ports and of special courts in the International Settlements at Shanghai and Amoy and in regard to the employment of foreign pilots in the ports of the territory of China are also relinquished . In the light of the abolition of treaty ports as such, it is understood that all coastal ports in the territory of the Republic of China which are normally open to American overseas merchant shipping will remain open to such shipping after the coming into effect of the present treaty and the accompanying exchange of notes.
It is mutually agreed that the merchant vessels of each country shall be permitted freely to come to the ports, places, and waters of the other country which are or may be open to overseas merchant shipping,

and that the treatment accorded to such vessels in such ports , places, and waters shall be no less favorable than that accorded to national

vessels and shall be as favorable as that accorded to the vessels of any third country.

It is mutually understood that the Government of the United States of America relinquishes the special rights which vessels of the United States of America have been accorded with regard to the coasting trade and inland navigation in the waters of the Republic of China and that the Government of the Republic of China is prepared to take over any American properties that may have been engaged for those purposes and to pay adequate compensation therefor. Should either country accord the rights of inland navigation or coasting trade to vessels of any third country such rights would similarly be accorded to the vessels of the other country. The coasting trade and inland navigation of each country are excepted from the requirement of national treatment and are to be regulated according to the laws of each country in relation thereto. It is agreed, however, that vessels of either

782

TREATIES

[57 STAT.

country shall enjoy within the territory of the other country with respect to the coasting trade and inland navigation treatment as favorable as that accorded to the vessels of any third country.
It is mutually understood that the Government of the United States of America relinquishes the special rights which naval vessels of the United States of America have been accorded in the waters of the Republic of China and that the Government of the Republic of China and the Government of the United States of America shall extend to each other the mutual courtesy of visits by their warships in accordance with international usage and comity.
It is mutually understood that questions which are not covered by the present treaty and exchange of notes and which may affect the sovereignty of the Republic of China shall be discussed by representatives of the two Governments and shall be decided in accordance with generally accepted principles of international law and with modern international practice.
With reference to Article IV of the treaty, the Government of the Republic of China hereby declares that the restriction on the right of alienation of existing rights or titles to real property referred to in that article will be applied by the Chinese authorities in an equitable manner and that if and when the Chinese Government declines to
give assent to a proposed transfer the Chinese Government will , in a spirit of justice and with a view to precluding loss on the part of American nationals whose interests are affected , undertake, if the American party in interest so desires, to take over the right or title in question and to pay adequate compensation therefor.
It is mutually understood that the orders, decrees, judgments , decisions and other acts of the United States Court for China and of the Consular Courts of the United States of America in China shall be con-
sidered as res judicata and shall , when necessary, be enforced by the Chinese authorities. It is further understood that any cases pending before the United States Court for China and the Consular Courts of the United States of America in China at the time of the coming into
effect of this treaty shall, if the plaintiff or petitioner so desires, be remitted to the appropriate courts of the Government of the Republic of China which shall proceed as expeditiously as possible with their disposition and in so doing shall in so far as practicable apply the laws of the United States of America.

[ Note in the English and Chinese Languages From the Secretary of State to the Chinese Ambassador at Washington ]

DEPARTMENT OF STATE WASHINGTON

EXCELLENCY :

January 11, 1943

In connection with the treaty signed today between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of China in which the Government of the United States of America

relinquishes its extraterritorial and related special rights in China, I

have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your note of today's date reading as follows :

"Excellency : Under instruction of my Government, I have the honor to state
that in connection with the treaty signed today by the Government
of the Republic of China and the Government of the United States

of America, in which the Government of the United States of

America relinquishes its extraterritorial and related special rights in China, it is the understanding of the Government of

the Republic of China that the rights of the Government of the United States of America and of its nationals in regard to the systems of treaty ports and of special courts in the International

Settlements at Shanghai and Amoy and in regard to the em-

ployment of foreign pilots in the ports of the territory of China are also relinquished. In the light of the abolition of treaty ports as such, it is understood that all coastal ports in the territory of the Republic of China which are normally open to American

overseas merchant shipping will remain open to such shipping after the coming into effect of the present treaty and the accompanying exchange of notes.
It is mutually agreed that the merchant vessels of each country shall be permitted freely to come to the ports, places, and waters of the other country which are or may be open to overseas mer-

Merchant vessels.

chant shipping, and that the treatment accorded to such vessels in such ports, places, and waters shall be no less favorable than that accorded to national vessels and shall be as favorable as that

accorded to the vessels of any third country.

States of America relinquishes the special rights which vessels of the United States of America have been accorded with regard to the coasting trade and inland navigation in the waters of the Republic of China and that the Government of the Republic of China is prepared to take over any American properties that may have been engaged for those purposes and to pay adequate com-

pensation therefor. Should either country accord the rights of inland navigation or coasting trade to vessels of any third country such rights would similarly be accorded to the vessels of the other country. The coasting trade and inland navigation of each country are excepted from the requirement of national treatment and are to be regulated according to the laws of each country in relation thereto. It is agreed , however, that vessels of either country shall enjoy within the territory of the other country with respect to the coasting trade and inland navigation treatment as favorable as that accorded to the vessels of any third country.
It is mutually understood that the Government of the United States of America relinquishes the special rights which naval vessels of the United States of America have been accorded in the waters of the Republic of China and that the Government of the Republic of China and the Government of the United States of America shall extend to each other the mutual courtesy of visits by their warships in accordance with international usage and comity.
It is mutually understood that questions which are not covered by the present treaty and exchange of notes and which may affect the sovereignty of the Republic of China shall be discussed by representatives of the two Governments and shall be decided in
accordance with generally accepted principles of international law and with modern international practice.
With reference to Article IV of the treaty, the Government of the Republic of China hereby declares that the restriction on the right of alienation of existing rights or titles to real property referred to in that article will be applied by the Chinese authorities in an equitable manner and that if and when the Chinese Government declines to give assent to a proposed transfer the Chinese Government will, in a spirit of justice and with a view to precluding loss on the part of American nationals whose interests are affected, undertake, if the American party in interest so desires, to take over the right or title in question and to pay adequate compensation therefor .
It is mutually understood that the orders, decrees, judgments, decisions and other acts of the United States Court for China and of the Consular Courts of the United States of America in China shall be considered as res judicata and shall, when necessary, be enforced by the Chinese authorities. It is further understood that any cases pending before the United States Court for China and the Consular Courts of the United States of America in China at the time of the coming into effect of this treaty shall, if the plaintiff or petitioner so desires, be remitted to the appropriate courts of the Government of the Republic of China which shall proceed as expeditiously as possible with their

The Belgian Ambassador to the Secretary of State

AMBASSADE DE BELGIQUE D.8492-4 No. 526

WASHINGTON, January 30, 1943

SIR :
In the United Nations declaration of January 1 , 1942, the contracting governments pledged themselves to employ their full resources, military and economic, against those nations with which they are at war ; and in the Agreement of June 16, 1942 , each contracting government undertook to provide the other with such articles, services , facilities or information useful in the prosecution of their common war undertaking as each may be in a position to supply. It is further the understanding of the Government of Belgium that the general principle to be followed in providing mutual aid as set forth in the said Agreement of June 16, 1942 , is that the war production and the war resources of both Nations should be used by the armed forces of each and of the other United Nation in ways which most effectively utilize the available materials, manpower, production facilities and shipping space .
With a view, therefore, to supplementing Article II and Article VI of the Agreement of June 16, 1942 , between our two Governments for the provision of reciprocal aid , I have the honor to set forth the understanding of the Government of Belgium of the principles and procedures applicable to the provision of aid by the Government of Belgium to the armed forces of the United States and the manner in which such aid will be correlated with the maintenance of such forces by the United States Government.

1.--The Government of Belgium, retaining the right of final decision in each case in the light of its potentialities and responsibilities, will provide the United States or its armed forces with the following types of assistance as such reciprocal aid , when it is found that they can most effectively be procured in Belgium or the Belgian Congo :
a) Supplies, materials, facilities and services for the United States forces, except for the pay and allowances of such forces, administrative expenses, and such local purchases as its of ficial establishments may make other than through the official establishments of the Government of Belgium as specified in paragraph two.

57 STAT. ]

BELGIUM- MUTUAL WAR AID- JAN. 30, 1943

921

b) Supplies, materials and services needed in the construction of military projects, tasks and similar capital works required for the common war effort in Belgium or the Belgian Congo, except for the wages and salaries of United States citizens.
c) Supplies, materials and services needed in the construction of such military projects, tasks and capital works in territory other than Belgium or the Belgian Congo or territory of the United States to the extent that Belgium or the Belgian Congo is a more practicable source of supply than the United States or another of the United Nations.

2. The practical application of the principles formulated in this

note, including the procedure by which requests for aid are made and acted upon, shall be worked out as occasion may require by agree-

ment between the two governments, acting when possible through their

appropriate military or civilian administrative authorities . Requests

by the United States Government for such aid will be presented by

duly authorized authorities of the United States to official agencies

of the Belgian Government which will be designated or established

by the Government of Belgium for the purpose of facilitating the

provision of reciprocal aid.

3. It is the understanding of the Government of Belgium that all

such aid, as well as other aid, including information received under Article VI of the Agreement of June 16, 1942 , accepted by the President of the United States or his authorized representatives from

56 Stat. 1505.

the Government of Belgium will be received as a benefit to the United States under the Act of March 11 , 1941. In so far as circumstances will permit, appropriate record of aid received under this arrangement, except for miscellaneous facilities and services, will be kept by each Government.

IIA, n$$te4,1p1-. 42109..

If the Government of the United States concurs in the foregoing, I would suggest that the present note and your reply to that effect be regarded as placing on record the understanding of our two governments in this matter and that for clarity and convenience of administration these arrangements be made retroactive to June 16, 1942, the date of the Agreement of the two Governments on the principles of mutual aid.
I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the assurances of my highest consideration .

SIR : I have the honor to refer to negotiations which have recently taken
place between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Canada for the conclusion of a reciprocal undertaking continuing in force the arrangement between the two Governments, entered into by an exchange of notes dated November 29, 1940 and December 2 , 1940 , for the purpose of giving effect to Article III of the Air Transport Arrangement between the two Governments concluded on August 18, 1939.
It is my understanding that it has been agreed in the course of the recent negotiations, now terminated , that the undertaking referred to in the preceding paragraph shall be as follows :
Having in mind the fact that because of the war situation it was impracticable for the aeronautical authorities of the United States and Canada to hold a meeting six months prior to December 31 , 1942, as contemplated by the arrangement between the two Governments entered into by an exchange of notes dated November 29, 1940 and December 2, 1940, for the purpose of drawing up new recommendations relating to the allocation of air transport routes to United States and Canadian air carriers for operations between the United States and Canada, it is now agreed that, subject to the provisions of the succeeding paragraph, the 1940 arrangement as herein referred to shall be considered to have remained in force from December 31 , 1942, and shall continue in force until the end of the war. It is also agreed that after the termination of the war a conference between representatives of the two Governments will be held for the purpose of reviewing the situation as it may then exist with respect to the application of the terms of the arrangement covered by the exchange of notes dated November 29, 1940 and December 2 , 1940 .
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, it is agreed that the present undertaking may be terminated at any time on six months' notice given in writing by either Government to the other Government for important reasons of public policy when the conditions thereof

or the actual practice thereunder is no longer regarded by the Government of the country giving such notice as being in its interest . Such notice of termination shall be given by either Government to the other only after consultation between the two Governments for a period of at least sixty days.
I shall be glad to have you inform me whether it is the understanding of your Government that the terms of the undertaking agreed to in the recent negotiations, now terminated , are as above set forth. If so, it is suggested that the undertaking become effective on this date. If your Government concurs in this suggestion the Government of the United States will regard the undertaking as becoming effective on this date.

27 NOVEMBER 1942

EXCELLENCY :

I have the honor to bring to Your Excellency's notice that my Government is desirous of renewing the contract entered into on April 23 , 1940 between our two Governments, whereby a United States Military Aviation Mission was established in Chile for a period of three years to assist in the development and functioning of the Chilean Air Force. This contract will expire in April of next year, and its early renewal is deemed convenient in order that there may be no possibility of a break in the continuity of the Mission , which might endanger the effective work it is accomplishing .
My Government has instructed me to suggest that it would be gratified if changes might be made in the junior officers of the Mission, in order that new members may be assigned who have had actual combat experience. Besides , it is desired that one officer should be especially informed in the modern methods of flight instruction presently followed in the United States , for primary as well as advanced training ; and that the other officer should be especially informed in matters relating to the maintenance of aviation materiel, and concerning the instruction given to non-commissioned officers and men in the technical schools of the Air Corps of the United States Army. There should be, also , two non-commissioned officers attached to the Mission: one an aviation mechanic and the other a radio mechanic, both highly qualified and with recognized experience .
In behalf of my Government, I beg leave to express the hope that the present Chief of the Mission , Colonel Omer Osmer Niergarth, may be permitted to continue at this post , where his services have been eminently satisfactory . However, should it be found necessary at any time for Your Excellency's Government to replace Colonel Niergarth as Chief of the Mission, my Government instructed me to suggest that he should be preferably a member of the Regular Army of the United States, otherwise a Reserve Officer completely familiar with modern tactics for the employment of military planes .

March 26, 1943 [E. A. S. 317]

The Government of the United States of America, the Government of Canada and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland considering that it is desirable , as a precaution against the adverse fortunes of war, to create a reserve of industrial diamonds upon the North American Continent, for possible needs of the United Nations, have agreed as follows :-

ARTICLE 1 .

Statement of Principle.

The contracting Governments intend that the normal consumption

requirements of the various nations shall be met currently from mine

production and from stocks in the United Kingdom and various pro-

ducing countries , and that the reserve hereinafter provided for shall

not be drawn upon except under the conditions stated in this

agreement .

ARTICLE 2 .

Size of Reserve.

The reserve shall contain a minimum quantity of 11,500,000 carats of diamonds suitable for the uses specified in Appendix I and con-
taining so far as possible the quantities in the various sizes specified under those uses.
ARTICLE 3.

Post, p. 936.

Composition of Reserve.

The Government of the United Kingdom will take such steps as are practicable for the reserve to be established by the transfer to Canada
of stocks of diamonds held by diamond producing companies and by the Diamond Corporation in the quantities and of the descriptions set forth in Appendix II. Appendix II also sets forth the quantities of diamonds of the various use classifications and sizes which it is
estimated will be found in the total quantities to be transferred by each company.
ARTICLE 4 .

Post, p. 936.

Transfer of Reserve.
Transfer of the reserve shall begin as soon as possible after the date of signature of this agreement.

such places in Canada as may be approved by the respective Governments . In the event that the Government of the United Kingdom desires to maintain a portion of the reserve in the United States , the Government of the United States will provide the necessary safe

depositories .

ARTICLE 5.

Maintenance of Production and Supply.

The Government of the United Kingdom and the Government of the United States agree to take all practicable steps to maintain production at, or, if necessary, to increase it to levels adequate to provide both for the full current requirements of the United Nations , and for the maintenance of the present stocks in the United States and the United Nations reserve. The Government of the United States will use its best efforts to maintain an adequate supply of industrial diamonds to Canada to meet the current requirements of Canadian industries and to maintain existing stocks . Estimates of the current annual requirements of the United Nations made as of the 30th June, 1942 , are set forth in Appendix III . It is understood , however, that such actual requirements may vary from these estimates from time to time.
ARTICLE 6 .

Conditions of Withdrawal.
A. Withdrawal by the United States. The Government of the United States shall be entitled to draw
upon the reserve stock, in any classification, when the United States stock of that classification falls to a quantity less than 90 per cent . of the normal stock as of the 30th June, 1942. The normal stocks as of the 30th June, 1942 , are set forth by classifications in Appendix IV and are the stocks in private and Government hands in the United States including 4,505,000 carats of boart purchased but not delivered as of that date. Upon notice furnished to the Government of the United Kingdom by the Government of the United States that the stock of any classification has fallen below 90 per cent . of such normal stock, the Government of the United Kingdom undertakes to take all reasonable steps to make shipments to restore such stock to the figures set forth in Appendix IV for such classification within 60 days . If, at the end of such 60-day period , the shipments have not been made, the Government of the United States shall be entitled to draw upon the United Nations reserve in quantities sufficient to restore the stock of such classification to the figures set forth in Appendix IV for such classification . The Government of the United States may effect such withdrawals through the Metals Reserve Company or any other Government agency or department or through merchants or other private parties nominated by it . B. Withdrawal by the United Kingdom.
The Government of the United Kingdom may draw upon the United Nations reserve when, in its opinion , it becomes impracticable to meet current requirements from stocks in the United Kingdom or

57 STAT. ] CANADA, GREAT BRITAIN- INDUSTRIAL DIAMONDS- MAR. 26, 1943

933

from African stocks or production . The Government of the United Kingdom shall , under such circumstances, formally assure the Government of the United States of the reasons and need for such withdrawal .

C. Withdrawal for Canadian Requirements . If the stocks in Canada of industrial diamonds of any of the descrip-
tions mentioned in Appendix IV fall at any time below the quantity of that description consumed in Canada during the preceding six months the Government of Canada may notify the Government of the United Kingdom and the Government of the United States that a shortage of industrial diamonds of that description exists . If the shortage of that description is not met either by delivery from the United States or from the United Kingdom within 90 days of the date of notification then the Government of the United Kingdom shall withdraw from the reserve for requirements in Canada such quantities of diamonds as are required to remove the shortage .

Post, p. 937.

D. Withdrawals for other United Nations Requirements . Withdrawals for the requirements of other United Nations may be
made after consultation between appropriate representatives of the Government of the United States and the Government of the United Kingdom . E. Combined Raw Materials Board.

The provisions of this Article are subject to any action which may be required as the result of decisions by the Combined Raw Materials Board.
ARTICLE 7 .

Prices of Material Withdrawn and Expenses of Transfer.
Industrial diamonds withdrawn from the United Nations reserve shall be withdrawn at United States dollar prices for comparable material (converted from Sterling at the official rate at the date of such withdrawal) ruling on the 30th June, 1942 , to which prices may be added reasonable amounts to cover the proportion of the cost of the establishment, maintenance and liquidation of the United Nations reserve attributable to the diamonds withdrawn . Provided that if the
ceiling prices of industrial diamonds in the United States are raised , the prices ruling on the 30th June, 1942 , and chargeable hereunder may be raised by the same percentage as the percentage increase or increases in such ceiling prices. Since it is probable that the United Nations reserve will include certain quantities of cuttable material not normally employed for industrial purposes but suitable therefor , the Government of the United Kingdom will , in the event of an emergency requiring the use of such cuttable material , employ its best efforts to furnish this material to the United Nations at reasonable prices reflecting the utility of the material and its cost of production for industrial purposes and not its value as gem stones.
All expenses of the transfer of diamonds to North America for the United Nations reserve and of the maintenance, sorting and liquidation of the reserve including indemnity for any loss or damage to the diamonds shall be advanced in equal proportion by the Government of
81077° 44 PT. II- 19

the United States and the Government of the United Kingdom subject to reimbursement from any sales from the reserve to the extent that the prices of sales from the reserve include, directly or indirectly, amounts which the Governments have advanced in respect of the establishment, maintenance and liquidation of the reserve. The Government of the United States undertakes to advance in the first instance any disbursements incurred in United States or Canadian dollars . On the liquidation of the reserve such part of the above-mentioned expenses as has not been reimbursed from sales from the reserve shall be shared
equally by the two Governments . The Ministry of Supply of the United Kingdom will keep running accounts of advances and reimbursements .
ARTICLE 8 .

Sorting of Material.
The Government of the United Kingdom will make adequate arrangements with the producing companies and with the Diamond Corporation to ensure that the United Nations reserve is sorted into the usual assortments of the Diamond Corporation upon its transfer to Canada and that such other necessary arrangements are made that withdrawals in accordance with the provisions of Article 6 can be made without any delay.
ARTICLE 9 .

Agreement with Producers.

The Government of the United States and the Government of

Canada take note of the draft agreement between the Minister of

Supply of the United Kingdom and certain diamond producers , the

Diamond Corporation , Ltd. and the Diamond Trading Company, Ltd., which is reproduced as Appendix V and will , so far as may be

necessary, afford facilities for the performance of the terms of such

an agreement.

ARTICLE 10.

Exchange of Information.
A. Information furnished by the Government of the United States. The Government of the United States undertakes to furnish to the
Government of the United Kingdom within 90 days after the end of each quarterly period commencing with that ending on the 31st December, 1942 , a statement, by classifications , of the stocks of industrial diamonds in the United States and of estimated purchases in South America until the end of 1946 .
B. Information furnished by the Government ofthe United Kingdom . The Government of the United Kingdom undertakes to furnish to
the Government of the United States, within 90 days after the end of each quarterly period commencing with that ending on the 31st December, 1942 , a statement by classifications of the stocks of industrial diamonds included in the United Nations reserve . Such statements shall include a summary of the results and progress of sorting in Canada . The Government of the United Kingdom further agrees

57 STAT. ] CANADA, GREAT BRITAIN- INDUSTRIAL DIAMONDS- MAR. 26, 1943

to furnish quarterly statements to the Government of the United States of stocks in the United Kingdom (separately for merchants, the Diamond Corporation and its affiliates, and producers) and, so far as possible , of stocks in the hands of producers in Africa .
Miscellaneous Provisions.

ARTICLE 11 .

Nothing in this agreement shall be construed to prevent any of the United Nations from acquiring additional quantities of industrial diamonds through purchase for its national reserve if diamonds are available and can be supplied without interfering with supplies for normal consumption and for the implementing of this agreement .

ARTICLE 12 .

The three contracting Governments agree to take such steps as are

reasonable.and practicable to ensure that all diamonds acquired by any person as industrial diamonds are sold by the most direct chan-

nels for use in industry and that they are not bought or sold specu-

latively or for hoarding.

ARTICLE 13 .

The Government of the United States and the Government of the United Kingdom will each appoint a representative to meet and adjust any difficulties of interpretation of this agreement which may arise from time to time. In any question affecting Canadian interests the Government of Canada may appoint a representative to collaborate with the representatives of the other two Governments .

ARTICLE 14.

Duration of Agreement.
This agreement shall operate from the date of signature and, except by mutual consent, it shall terminate nine months after the cessation of hostilities . For the purpose of this clause the cessation of hostilities shall be the date on which there is a general suspension of hostilities between the United Kingdom and the United States (or the later of them to suspend hostilities) on the one hand and the last of the enemy Powers with whom they are now at war on the other hand .

And whereas the Companies, the Corporation and the Trading Company have agreed to collaborate with the Minister in the establishment of the Reserve in manner hereinafter appearing
Now it is hereby agreed as follows :-

ARTICLE 1.

Each of the Companies and the Corporation will transfer to addresses in Canada approved by the Minister the quantities and descriptions of diamonds stated against its name in Schedule I of this Agreement. The aggregate of such diamonds when so transferred shall constitute the Reserve.

ARTICLE 2 .
The diamonds in the Reserve will remain the property of one of the Companies or the Corporation or the Trading Company as the case may be and shall be sold to any person who is not a party to this Agreement only at the request of the Minister and by or through the Trading Company and in accordance with any contracts between the Companies and any of them and the Corporation which may for the time being be operative.

57 STAT. ] CANADA, GREAT BRITAIN- INDUSTRIAL DIAMONDS MAR. 26, 1943
ARTICLE 3.
No part of the Reserve shall be removed from the approved addresses in Canada except with the consent of the Minister or except at the request of the Minister to meet an emergency requirement for industrial diamonds notified to the Corporation by the Minister. On receipt of such notification, the Corporation will arrange for the sale from the Reserve of such classes and quantities of diamonds to the Government of or merchants in the country where the emergency requirement has arisen as may be specified in the notification. The notification will specify the quantities of diamonds to be sold in the normal selling classifications of the Trading Company and each of the Companies will sell to the Corporation , according to the normal contracts existing between it and the Corporation , such quantities and classes of diamonds as the Corporation may call upon it to provide as being necessary to meet the emergency requirement.
ARTICLE 4.
(1) It is the intention of the parties hereto that the Companies, the Corporation and the Trading Company shall be relieved of all payments in connexion with the diamonds provided for the Reserve other than payments which the Companies, the Corporation or the Trading Company would have made if the diamonds had not been provided for the Reserve and with a view thereto the following provisions shall apply:-
(2) The Minister shall(a) discharge all expenses of the transfer of diamonds to North America for the Reserve and of the maintenance, sorting and liquidation of the Reserve ; (b) discharge all other proper payments , including all (if any) taxes, duties, assessments or charges, whether on export, sales, income or otherwise, which would not have been incurred or levied if the diamonds had not been removed to North America for the purposes of the Reserve.
(3) Each of the Companies shall refund to the Minister from the proceeds of the sale by it of any diamonds comprised in the Reserve such expenses or payments discharged by the Minister in respect of those diamonds as the Company would have discharged if those diamonds had been sold in London to the Diamond Corporation on the 30th June, 1942.
(4) The Diamond Corporation shall refund to the Minister from the proceeds of the sale by it of any diamonds comprised in the Reserve such expenses or payments discharged by the Minister in respect of those diamonds as the Corporation would have discharged if those diamonds had been sold by it on the 30th June, 1942.
(5) The Trading Company shall refund to the Minister from the proceeds of the sale by it of any diamonds comprised in the Reserve such expenses or payments discharged by the Minister in respect of those diamonds as the Trading Company would have discharged if those diamonds had been sold by it in London on the 30th June, 1942.

(6) If on the termination of this Agreement there remain unsold any diamonds which were included in the Reserve the Minister will be entitled to the refund out of the proceeds of the sale of those diamonds by the Company owning them , the Corporation and the Trading Company of only such expenses or payments discharged by him in respect of those diamonds as the Company, the Corporation and the Trading Company respectively would have discharged if the diamonds had not formed part of the Reserve. The Minister will, however, be prepared to consider with the other parties hereto when the time arises whether this obligation should be discharged by part payment of the estimated amount due from those other parties or otherwise.

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [ 57 STAT.
ARTICLE 5.
The transfer of diamonds to Canada under this Agreement shall begin as soon as possible after the date of signature of this Agreement and the Companies and the Corporation severally undertake to use their best efforts to transfer the diamonds mentioned in Schedule I opposite their respective names at a rate not less than the rate set forth and from the date set forth in Schedule II for each Company. Single shipments shall not exceed 300,000 carats each.
ARTICLE 6.
The Companies and the Corporation will arrange for the sorting of the diamonds in the Reserve in such manner as will enable the quantities of industrial diamonds suitable for the various industrial uses to which they are put to be estimated readily and in such manner as they will be readily available for sale in the usual selling classifications of the Trading Company. A report on the quantities of diamonds of various classes in the Reserve and of the progress of the sorting will be furnished to the Minister by each of the Companies, the Corporation and the Trading Company or by the Corporation on their behalf for each quarter commencing with that ending on the 31st March, 1943, and at the end of each three months thereafter.
ARTICLE 7.
The prices at which the diamonds will be sold from the Reserve will be the Trading Company's selling prices in operation on the 30th June, 1942, with the addition of such amounts as are estimated by the Minister to be reasonable to cover the additional costs of the Minister, the Companies, the Corporation and the Trading Company for the establishment, maintenance and liquidation of the Reserve (including the costs of returning diamonds to the United Kingdom and insurance mentioned in Articles 9 and 10) , provided that if the ceiling prices of industrial diamonds in the United States are raised the Trading Company's selling prices for diamonds in the Reserve may be increased correspondingly with the consent of the Minister. If rough diamonds of cuttable quality not normally sold as industrial diamonds are sold out of the Reserve as industrial diamonds , the prices to be charged by the Trading Company will be such reasonable prices as reflect the utility of the material and its cost of production for industrial purposes and not its value as gem stones. Such diamonds shall be sold at those prices subject to an undertaking that they will be re-sold only for use in industry and notification of such sales will be made to the Minister.
ARTICLE 8 .
The Companies, the Corporation and the Trading Company severally agree to furnish to the Minister within 30 days after the end of each quarterly period commencing with that ending on the 31st March, 1943, a statement of the stocks of industrial diamonds which they hold , with such information as to the quantities of the various classes mentioned in Schedule I contained in the stocks as will enable an estimate to be made of the quantities which are suitable for various industrial uses.
ARTICLE 9.
The Minister will make provision at his own expense for the return to the United Kingdom of the diamonds remaining in the Reserve at the termination of this Agreement.
ARTICLE 10.
The Minister will pay the costs of insuring at the current selling prices of the owners the diamonds provided for the Reserve against all insurable risks of damage or loss from the date when the diamonds are despatched from storage en route to Canada until they are sold or returned to the United Kingdom in

57 STAT. ] CANADA, GREAT BRITAIN- INDUSTRIAL DIAMONDS - MAR. 26, 1943
accordance with the provisions of Article 9 or otherwise cease to be covered by this Agreement, whichever first happens . These costs shall be regarded as expenses for the purpose of refunds to the Minister under Article 4 of this Agreement.
ARTICLE 11.
This Agreement shall operate from the date of signature and, unless in view of the passing of the emergency it is terminated earlier by mutual consent, shall terminate nine months after the cessation of hostilities, except as regards the reimbursement of expenses referred to in Article 4 hereof. For the purpose of this clause the cessation of hostilities shall be the date on which there is a general suspension of hostilities between the United Kingdom and the United States of America (or the later of them to suspend hostilities) on the one hand and the last of the enemy Powers with whom they are now at war on the other hand.
ARTICLE 12.
This Agreement shall be construed according to the law of England.

DEPARTMENT OF STATE WASHINGTON

SIR :

March 31, 1942

I have the honor to refer to your note dated January 22, 1942 [ ¹ ] and conversations which have taken place between the officers of the

Norwegian Legation and of the Department with respect to the application of the United States Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, as amended, to Norwegian subjects residing in the United States.
As you are aware, the Act provides that with certain exceptions

$$ 301-318; Supp. II, $$ 302-315.
Ante, pp. 164, 391, 596.

every male citizen of the United States and every other male person

residing in the United States between the ages of eighteen and sixty-

five shall register. The Act further provides that, with certain exceptions, registrants within specified age limits are liable for active

military service in the United States armed forces.

This Government recognizes that from the standpoint of morale

of the individuals concerned and the over-all military effort of the

countries at war with the Axis Powers , it would be desirable to permit

certain classes of individuals who have registered or who may register

under the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, as amended , to

enlist in the armed forces of a cobelligerent country , should they desire

to do so. It will be recalled that during the World War this Govern-

ment signed conventions with certain associated powers on this sub-

ject. The United States Government believes, however, that under

existing circumstances the same ends may now be accomplished

through administrative action , thus obviating the delays incident to the signing and ratification of conventions.
This Government is prepared, therefore , to initiate a procedure which will permit aliens who have registered under the Selective

Nationals of Co-
belligerent countries. Induction proce-
dure.

Training and Service Act of 1940, as amended , who are nationals of

cobelligerent countries and who have not declared their intention of

becoming American citizens to elect to serve in the forces of their respective countries, in lieu of service in the armed forces of the United

States, at any time prior to their induction into the armed forces of this

country. Individuals who so elect will be physically examined by the armed forces of the United States, and if found physically qualified, the results of such examinations will be forwarded to the proper author-

ities of the cobelligerent nation for determination of acceptability.

Upon receipt of notification that an individual is acceptable and also

receipt of the necessary travel and meal vouchers from the cobelligerent government involved , the appropriate State Director of the Selective

Service System will direct the local Selective Service Board having

jurisdiction in the case to send the individual to a designated recep-

tion point for induction into active service in the armed forces of the cobelligerent country. If upon arrival it is found that the individual

is not acceptable to the armed forces of the cobelligerent country, he shall be liable for immediate induction into the armed forces of the

Stipulations to be agreed to by CObelligerent country.

United States. Before the above-mentioned procedure will be made effective with
respect to a cobelligerent country, this Department wishes to receive

from the diplomatic representative in Washington of that country a

note stating that his government desires to avail itself of the procedure and in so doing agrees that:

(a) No threat or compulsion of any nature will be exercised by his government to induce any person in the United States to enlist in the forces of any foreign government ;
(b) Reciprocal treatment will be granted to American citizens by his government ; that is, prior to induction in the armed forces of his government they will be granted the opportunity of electing to serve in the armed forces of the United States in substantially the same manner as outlined above. Furthermore, his government shall agree to inform all American citizens serving in its armed forces or former American citizens who may have lost their citizenship as a result of having taken an oath of allegiance on enlistment in such armed forces and who are now serving in those forces that they may transfer to the armed forces of the United States provided they desire to do so and provided they are acceptable to the armed forces of the United States. The arrangements
for effecting such transfers are to be worked out by the appropriate representatives of the armed forces of the respective governments.
(c) No enlistments will be accepted in the United States by his government of American citizens subject to registration or of aliens of any nationality who have declared their intention of
becoming American citizens and are subject to registration.

This Government is prepared to make the proposed regime effective immediately with respect to the Kingdom of Norway upon the receipt from you of a note stating that your Government desires to participate in it and agrees to the stipulations set forth in lettered paragraphs (a) , (b) , and ( c) above.
Accept, Sir, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration. SUMNER WELLES

EXCELLENCY :

As you are aware, the Act provides that with certain exceptions

every male citizen of the United States and every other male person

residing in the United States between the ages of eighteen and sixty-

five shall register. The Act further provides that, with certain excep-

tions , registrants within specified age limits are liable for active mili-

tary service in the United States armed forces.

This Government recognizes that from the standpoint of morale of

the individuals concerned and the over-all military effort of the

countries at war with the Axis Powers , it would be desirable to permit

certain nationals of cobelligerent countries who have registered or who

may register under the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 ,

as amended, to enlist in the armed forces of their own country, should

they desire to do so . It will be recalled that during the World War

this Government signed conventions with certain associated powers

on this subject . The United States Government believes , however,

that under existing circumstances the same ends may now be ac-

complished through administrative action , thus obviating the delays

of cobelligerent countries who have not declared their intention of

ment are to be worked out directly between the War Department and the Selective Service System on the part of the United States Government and the appropriate authorities of the Cuban Government . It should be understood, however, that in all cases a person

exercising an option under the arrangement must actually be ac-

cepted by the military authorities of the country of his allegiance before

his departure from the United States.

(a) No threat or compulsion of any nature will be exercised by his government to induce any person in the United States to enlist in the forces of his or any foreign government ;
(b) Reciprocal treatment will be granted to American citizens by his government ; that is, prior to induction in the armed forces of his government they will be granted the opportunity of electing to serve in the armed forces of the United States in substantially the same manner as outlined above . Furthermore, his government shall agree to inform all American citizens serving in its armed forces or former American citizens who may have lost their citizenship as a result of having taken an oath of allegiance on enlistment in such armed forces and who are now serving in those forces that they may transfer to the armed forces of the United States provided they desire to do so and provided they are acceptable to the armed forces of the United States . The arrangements for effecting such transfers are to be worked out by the appropriate representatives of the armed forces of the respective governments ;
(c) No enlistments will be accepted in the United States by his government of American citizens subject to registration or of aliens of any nationality who have declared their intention of becoming American citizens and are subject to registration .

This Government is prepared to make the proposed regime effective immediately with respect to the Republic of Cuba upon the receipt from you of a note stating that your Government desires to participate in it and agrees to the stipulations set forth in lettered paragraphs (a) , (b) , and (c) above.

EXCELENCIA : Tengo el honor de referirme a la nota de Vuestra Excelencia de 6 de
noviembre de 1942 en relación con las conversaciones que han tenido lugar entre funcionarios de la Embajada de Cuba y del Departamento de Estado con respecto a la aplicación de la Ley de Entrenamiento y Servicio Selectivo de 1940 , de los Estados Unidos, tal como ha sido modificada, a los ciudadanos cubanos que residen en los Estados Unidos .
Señala Vuestra Excelencia que dicha Ley estipula que, con ciertas excepciones , todo varón ciudadano de los Estados Unidos y todo otro varón que resida en los Estados Unidos , comprendido entre las edades de 18 y 65 años , deberá inscribirse , estipulando la Ley además , que, con ciertas excepciones, los individuos inscritos comprendidos dentro de ciertos límites de edad especificados se hallan sujetos a la obligación de prestar servicio militar activo en las fuerzas armadas de los Estados Unidos .
A este respecto informa Vuestra Excelencia que el Gobierno de los Estados Unidos reconoce que desde el punto de vista de la moral de los individuos afectados y del esfuerzo militar en general de los países en guerra contra las potencias del Eje , sería deseable el permitir que ciertos nacionales de países cobeligerantes que se han inscrito o que se inscriban bajo la Ley de Entrenamiento y Servicio Selectivo de 1940 , tal como ha sido modificada , se alisten en las fuerzas armadas de su propio país, si así lo desearen, a cuyo efecto , el Gobierno de Vuestra Excelencia se halla dispuesto a iniciar un procedimiento por el cual se permitirá a los cubanos que se hayan inscrito bajo la Ley de Entrenamiento y Servicio Selectivo de 1940 , tal como ha sido modificada, y que no hayan declarado su intención de adoptar la ciudadanía americana, el elegir servir en las fuerzas armadas de Cuba en lugar de prestar servicio en las fuerzas armadas de los Estados Unidos, en cualquier momento anterior a su incorporación a las fuerzas armadas de este país. Igualmente se permitirá a los cubanos que no hayan declarado su intención de adoptar la ciudadanía americana , que ya estén prestando servicio en las fuerzas armadas de los Estados Unidos , el elegir trasladarse a las fuerzas armadas de Cuba . Se estipula , sin embargo , que en todo caso la persona que ejerza tal opción bajo este arreglo deberá ser efectivamente aceptada por las autoridades militares de Cuba antes de su salida de los Estados Unidos.
Se propone en la nota de Vuestra Excelencia que los detalles del arreglo sean acordados directamente entre el Departamento de la Guerra y el Sistema de Servicio Selectivo , por parte del Gobierno de los Estados Unidos , y las autoridades competentes del Gobierno de Cuba .

EMBASSY OF CUBA WASHINGTON, D.C.
JANUARY 9 , 1943. EXCELLENCY:
I have the honor to refer to Your Excellency's note of November 6 , 1942 , relative to the conversations which have taken place between officials of the Embassy of Cuba and the Department of State with respect to the application of the Selective Service and Training Act of 1940 of the United States , as amended, to Cuban citizens residing in the United States .
Your Excellency states that the said Act provides that , with certain exceptions, every male citizen of the United States and all other males who reside in the United States, between the ages of 18 and 65 years , must register, the Act further providing that , with certain exceptions , the registered individuals included within certain specified age limits are subject to rendering compulsory active military service in the armed forces of the United States .
In this connection Your Excellency advises that the Government of the United States recognizes that , from the viewpoint of the morale of the individuals affected and of the military effort in general of the countries at war against the Axis powers , it would be desirable to permit certain nationals of co-belligerent countries who have registered or may register under the Selective Service and Training Act of 1940 , as amended , to enlist in the armed forces of their own country if they so desire, for which purpose Your Excellency's Government is disposed to initiate a procedure whereby Cubans who have registered under the Selective Service and Training Act of 1940, as amended, and who have not declared their intention of adopting American citizenship, will be permitted to elect to serve in the armed forces of Cuba instead of rendering service in the armed forces of the United States, at any time prior to their entry into the armed forces

57 STAT.]

CUBA- MILITARY SERVICE- Nov. 6, 1942 Jan. 9, Feb. 1 , 1943

of this country . Likewise, Cubans who have not declared their intention of adopting American citizenship and who are already serving in the armed forces of the United States will be permitted to elect to transfer to the armed forces of Cuba . It is stipulated , however, that in every case the person exercising such an option under this arrangement must actually be accepted by the Cuban military authorities before his departure from the United States .
It is proposed in Your Excellency's note that the details of the arrangement be agreed upon directly between the War Department and the Selective Service System, on behalf of the Government of the United States, and competent authorities of the Government of Cuba.
Your Excellency advises me that the Government of the United States is disposed to put the above-mentioned policy into effect immediately with respect to the Republic of Cuba , subject to the following conditions:
(a) No threat or coercion of any kind shall be used by the Government of Cuba to induce any person who is in the United States to enlist in the armed forces of Cuba or of any other foreign Government ;
(b) Reciprocal treatment shall be granted by the Government of Cuba to American citizens ; that is to say, prior to their entry into the armed forces of Cuba they shall be given an opportunity to elect to serve in the armed forces of the United States in a manner substantially similar to that indicated above . Furthermore, the Government of Cuba will agree to inform all American citizens who are serving in the armed forces or former American citizens who have lost their citizenship as a consequence of having taken an oath of allegiance upon joining the armed forces of Cuba and who are now serving in the said forces , that they will be able to transfer to the armed forces of the United States if they so desire and provided that they are acceptable to the armed forces of the United States . The arrangements for effecting such transfers shall be agreed upon by the representatives of the armed forces of the respective Governments ;
(c ) There shall not be accepted by the Republic of Cuba enlistments, in the United States, of American citizens subject to registration or of foreigners of any nationality who have declared their intention of adopting American citizenship and are subject to registration .
I have the honor to advise Your Excellency that my Government desires to avail itself of the procedure suggested in Your Excellency's note and that it agrees to do so under the conditions stated and with the stipulations expressed in paragraphs (a) , (b ) , and (c) set forth above.
With respect to paragraph (a) , nevertheless , my Government de sires to point out that Obligatory Military Service exists in Cuba and that, although for the time being it is applicable only to Cuban citizens, the Cuban Government reserves the right to extend it to foreigners in

general. In the latter case the stipulations of paragraph (b) guarantee to American citizens in Cuba the same treatment as that offered by the present arrangement to Cuban citizens in the United States .
With respect to the same paragraph (a) , it is desired to point out, furthermore, that, according to the Emergency Military Service Law of 1941 of the Republic of Cuba , Cuban citizens at present in the United States are under obligation to register for military service in the armed forces of Cuba at consular offices of the Republic in this country, being subject to call according to lottery. Non-fulfilment of this obligation renders a person liable to appropriate penalties .
It is hoped that within a short time it will be possible to advise Your Excellency of the designation of the Cuban authorities who are to come to an agreement with the War Department and the Selective Service System regarding the details of the arrangement.
I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the assurance of my highest consideration.

SEÑOR ENCARGADO DE NEGOCIOS : Tengo la honra de referirme, por medio de la presente nota, a las
negociaciones celebradas con objeto de regular ciertos aspectos del desempeño del servicio militar de los nacionales de nuestros dos países que residan en el territorio del otro .
De las conversaciones efectuadas hasta la fecha se desprende no sólo el natural interés con que las autoridades de ambas naciones ven este asunto , sino también su firme propósito de llegar a un acuerdo satisfactorio que corresponda a las excelentes relaciones que felizmente ligan a nuestras dos Repúblicas.
En vista de lo anterior, me permito proponer a la consideración del Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de América, por su muy estimable conducto , el siguiente proyecto de arreglo :

"I.-Los nacionales de cada país, residentes dentro del territorio del otro, pueden ser registrados y reclutados en las fuerzas armadas del país de su residencia , en las mismas condiciones que los nacionales de éste, a menos de que se estipule lo contrario en este documento .
II .-Los nacionales de cada país que residen en el otro , tendrán los mismos derechos y privilegios que los nacionales del país de su residencia. Las autoridades de los respectivos países , en la selección y reclutamiento en sus fuerzas armadas de los nacionales del otro , tomarán en cuenta sobre las mismas bases , como si se tratara de sus propios nacionales , las condiciones físicas y de salud de los individuos de que se trate, su estado civil , las personas que de ellos dependan económicamente , independientemente del lugar en que éstas residan , y cualquiera otra circunstancia que, de acuerdo con las leyes y reglamentos vigentes en el país de su residencia, sean aplicables a la selección y reclutamiento de los nacionales de este último .
III .-Los nacionales de cada país que se encuentren en el territorio del otro, con el propósito de estudiar y con la intención de regresar al país de que son nacionales al terminar sus estudios , al comprobar tales hechos de acuerdo con las leyes y reglamentos existentes para el servicio militar, serán relevados de la obligación de servir en las fuerzas armadas .

974

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [57 STAT.

IV . Los nacionales de cada país que , de acuerdo con las leyes de inmigración del otro son "residentes técnicos" del último país, conocidos como "residentes fronterizos" (border crossers ) deberán ser considerados como residentes del país en el que de hecho viven, para los fines del servicio militar.
V.-Los funcionarios y empleados de cada país que residan en el otro y cuya situación oficial haya sido notificada al Gobierno del

"Mr. Chargé d'Affaires : I have the honor to refer to the negotiations effected for the
purpose of regulating certain aspects of the performance of military service by nationals of our two countries residing in the territory of the other country.
The conversations held to date elicit not only the natural interest with which the authorities of both nations view this matter, but also their determination to reach a satisfactory agreement which will coincide with the excellent relations which

happily bind our two Republics . In view of the foregoing I beg to propose for the consideration
of the Government of the United States of America through your esteemed mediary , the following proposed arrangement:
Proposed arrange"I. The nationals of either country resident within the terri- ment. tory of the other may be registered and inducted into the armed forces of the country of their residence on the same conditions as the nationals thereof unless otherwise provided herein. "II . Nationals of either country residing in the other shall be accorded the same rights and privileges as nationals of the country of residence . In the selection and induction into their armed forces of nationals of the other country the authorities of the respective countries shall take into account on the same basis as if their own nationals were involved the physical condition and health of the individuals concerned , their civil status, their financial dependents , regardless of the place of residence and any other circumstances which under the laws and regulations in force in the country of residence would apply in selecting and inducting nationals of the latter country . "III . Nationals of either country in the territory of the other country for purposes of study and with the intention of returning to the country of which they are nationals upon the termination of such study shall upon establishing such facts in accordance with existing selective service laws and regulations be relieved from the obligation of military service.

DEPARTMENT OF STATE WASHINGTON

SIR :

with respect to the application of the United States Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, as amended , to Salvadoran citizens residing in the United States.
As you are aware, the Act provides that with certain exceptions

every male citizen of the United States and every other male person

residing in the United States between the ages of eighteen and sixty-

five shall register. The Act further provides that, with certain excep-

tions, registrants within specified age limits are liable for active military service in the United States armed forces.

This Government recognizes that from the standpoint of morale of

the individuals concerned and the over-all military effort of the coun-

tries at war with the Axis Powers, it would be desirable to permit

certain nationals of cobelligerent countries who have registered or

who may register under the Selective Training and Service Act of

1940, as amended , to enlist in the armed forces of their own country , should they desire to do so. It will be recalled that during the World

War this Government signed conventions with certain associated powers on this subject. The United States Government believes ,

however, that under existing circumstances the same ends may now

be accomplished through administrative action, thus obviating the

delays incident to the signing and ratification of conventions .

respective countries, in lieu of service inthe armed forces of the

United States , at any time prior to their induction into the armed

forces of this country. This Government is also prepared to afford

to nationals of cobelligerent countries who have not declared their intention of becoming American citizens who may already be serving

in the armed forces of the United States an opportunity of electing to transfer to the armed forces of their own country. The details of the arrangement are to be worked out directly between the War Department and the Selective Service System on the part of the United States Government and the appropriate authorities of the Salvadoran Government . It should be understood , however, that in all cases a person exercising an option under the arrangement must actually be accepted by the military authorities of the country of his allegiance before his departure from the United States .

from the diplomatic representative in Washington of that country a note stating that his Government desires to avail itself of the procedure and in so doing agrees that :
(a) No effort will be made by his Government to induce any person in the United States to enlist in the forces of his or any foreign government ;
(b) Reciprocal treatment will be granted to American citizens by his Government ; that is, prior to induction in the armed forces of his Government they will be granted the opportunity of electing to serve in the armed forces of the United States in substantially the same manner as outlined above. Furthermore, his Government shall agree to inform all American citizens serving in its armed forces or former American citizens who may have lost their citizenship as a result of having taken an oath of allegiance on enlistment in such armed forces and who are now serving in those forces that they may transfer to the armed forces of the United States provided they desire to do so and provided they are acceptable to the armed forces of the United States . The arrangements for effecting such transfers are to be worked out by the appropriate representatives of the armed forces of the respective governments ;
(c) No enlistments will be accepted in the United States by his Government of American citizens subject to registration or of aliens of any nationality who have declared their intention of
becoming American citizens and are subject to registration.
This Government is prepared to make the proposed regime effective immediately with respect to the Republic of El Salvador upon the receipt from you of a note stating that your Government desires to participate in it and agrees to the stipulations set forth in lettered paragraphs (a) , (b) , and (c) above.

EMBAJADA DE EL SALVADOR WASHINGTON MAYO 14 , 1943 .
SEÑOR: Tengo el honor de referirme a la atenta nota de Vuestra Excelencia ,
de fecha 3 de Abril último , lo mismo que a conversaciones anteriores que han tenido lugar entre funcionarios de esta Misión Diplomática Salvadoreña y del Departamento de Estado con respecto a la aplicación a ciudadanos salvadoreños , residentes en los Estados Unidos , de la Ley de Entrenamiento y Servicio Selectivo de los Estados Unidos, de 1940 .
Mi Gobierno ha estudiado con toda atención el contenido de la atenta nota de Vuestra Excelencia, en la cual está detallado un proyecto de arreglo que puede solucionar de modo completo el problema de transferencias de nacionales de nuestros respectivos países al Ejército de su propia bandera , en sustitución del servicio que podrían prestar, o que ya estén prestando , en el Ejército del país en que residen ; y he recibido ya las instrucciones de mi Gobierno de aceptar en todas sus partes el arreglo propuesto en la atenta nota de Vuestra Excelencia.
El procedimiento sugerido en la misma nota a que me estoy refiriendo , descansa en las siguientes bases :
"La Ley de Entrenamiento y Servicio Selectivo de los Estados Unidos , de 1940 , provee que, con ciertas excepciones, todo ciudadano varón de los Estados Unidos y todo otro varón domiciliado en los Estados Unidos, entre las edades de dieciocho y sesenta y cinco años , debe ser inscrito . La Ley provee además que, con ciertas excepciones, los varones inscritos y comprendidos dentro de ciertos límites de edad especificados, están sujetos a servicio militar activo en las fuerzas armadas de los Estados Unidos . "El Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de América reconoce que desde el punto de vista de la situación moral de los individuos mencionados y del primordial esfuerzo militar de las Naciones en guerra con los Poderes del Eje , sería deseable permitir a ciertos nacionales de los países cobeligerantes , ya inscritos o que se inscriban de acuerdo con la Ley de Entrenamiento y Servicio Selectivo de 1940 , alistarse en las fuerzas armadas de su propio país , si ellos así lo desearen . Se recordará que durante la Guerra Mundial, el Gobierno de los Estados Unidos firmó convenciones con varios Poderes asociados sobre esta materia. El Gobierno de los Estados Unidos cree , sin embargo, que bajo las circunstancias actuales, el mismo propósito puede ahora ser realizado por medio de acción administrativa, evitando así las demoras resultantes de la firma y ratificación de convenciones. "El Gobierno de los Estados Unidos está preparado , por consiguiente, para iniciar un procedimiento que permita a los extran-

57 STAT. ] EL SALVADOR- MILITARY SERVICE-APR. 3, MAY 14, 31 , 1943
jeros que se hayan registrado bajo la Ley de Entrenamiento y Servicio Selectivo de 1940, reformada, que además sean nacionales de países cobeligerantes y que no hayan declarado intención de convertirse en ciudadanos de los Estados Unidos, que elijan el servir en las fuerzas de sus respectivos países en vez de prestar servicio en las fuerzas de los Estados Unidos , en cualquiera fecha anterior a su alistamiento en las fuerzas armadas de los Estados Unidos. El Gobierno de los Estados Unidos está también preparado a ofrecer a nacionales de países cobeligerantes, que no hayan declarado su intención de convertirse en ciudadanos de los Estados Unidos y que ya estén sirviendo en las fuerzas armadas de los Estados Unidos, una oportunidad para elegir su transferencia a las fuerzas armadas de su propio país . Los detalles del arreglo deben ser concertados directamente entre el Departamento de Guerra y el Sistema de Servicio Selectivo , por parte del Gobierno de los Estados Unidos , y las Autoridades respectivas del Gobierno Salvadoreño . Debe ser entendido , sin embargo, que en todos los casos en que una persona ejerza la opción contemplada en este arreglo, tal opción debe ser aceptada por las Autoridades Militares del Gobierno de su nacionalidad antes de que se permita su partida de los Estados Unidos."
De acuerdo con las bases que acaban de copiarse , Vuestra Excelencia me informa, en la misma nota del 3 de Abril último , que antes de que el procedimiento arriba mencionado entre a ser efectivo entre nuestros dos Gobiernos , el Departamento de Estado desea recibir del infrascrito , como Representante Diplomático de El Salvador en los Estados Unidos de América , una nota declarando que el Gobierno de El Salvador desea aprovecharse del mismo procedimiento y que, al hacerlo , se compromete a lo siguiente:
(a) "Ningún esfuerzo será hecho por el Gobierno de El Salvador para inducir a alguna persona en los Estados Unidos para que se aliste en sus propias fuerzas o en las de cualquier Gobierno extranjero ;
(b) "Un tratamiento recíproco será concedido por el Gobierno de El Salvador a los ciudadanos de los Estados Unidos de América, esto es, de modo previo al alistamiento en las fuerzas armadas de su Gobierno , se ofrecerá a ellos la oportunidad de elegir servicio en las fuerzas armadas de los Estados Unidos en una forma sustancialmente igual a la antes descrita. Además, el Gobierno de El Salvador se compromete a informar a todos los ciudadanos de los Estados Unidos que estén sirviendo en sus fuerzas armadas , lo mismo que a antiguos ciudadanos de los Estados Unidos que puedan haber perdido su nacionalidad como resultado de haber hecho un juramento de lealtad al alistarse en tales fuerzas armadas, en las cuales estén sirviendo , que pueden ahora ser transferidos a las fuerzas armadas de los Estados Unidos , si ellos así lo desean y bajo la condición de que sean aceptables a las. fuerzas arma-

985

986

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [57 STAT.
das de los Estados Unidos. Los arreglos para efectuar tales traslados deben concertarse entre los correspondientes representantes de las fuerzas armadas de nuestros respectivos Gobiernos ; (c) " El Gobierno de El Salvador no aceptará ningún alistamiento en los Estados Unidos de ciudadanos de la Unión Federal, sujetos allí a registro , ni tampoco de extranjeros de cualquiera nacionalidad que hayan declarado su intención de convertirse en ciudadanos de los Estados Unidos y que estén sujetos a registro (inscripción militar) ."
Vuestra Excelencia me informa además, en la misma nota del 3 de Abril último, que el Gobierno de los Estados Unidos está preparado para hacer efectivo inmediatamente el Arreglo así propuesto, con respecto a la República de El Salvador, al recibir del infrascrito una nota declarando que el Gobierno de El Salvador desea participar en él y que conviene en las estipulaciones detalladas en los párrafos de letras (a) , (b) y (c), que constan arriba.
En cumplimiento de las instrucciones que he recibido, tengo el honor de informar a Vuestra Excelencia que mi Gobierno desea participar en el Arreglo antes detallado y que conviene expresamente en las estipulaciones detalladas en los párrafos de letras (a) , (b) y (c) , ya copiados en la presente nota.
En relación con el párrafo de letra (a) , mi Gobierno reserva a su Poder Legislativo el derecho de extender a extranjeros las obligaciones de servicio militar, que en la actualidad se exigen únicamente a los ciudadanos salvadoreños . Esta aclaración se hace en previsión de cambios legislativos que puedan ser exigidos por la presente situación de guerra ; y es de notarse que la misma aclaración acentúa la reciprocidad establecida en el Arreglo .
Reitero a Vuestra Excelencia las seguridades de mi más alta consideración .

dent in the United States, of the Selective Training and Service Act of the United States of 1940.

54 Stat. 885. 50 U. S. C. app.

My Government has studied with all attention the content of Your §§ 330021--331158.; Supp. II, Excellency's kind note, in which is detailed a proposed arrangement 596Ante, pp. 164, 391,

which can solve completely the problem of transfers of nationals of

our respective countries to the army of their own flag, in substitution for the service which they might render, or are already rendering, in

the army of the country in which they reside ; and I have received instructions from my Government to accept in all its parts the arrange-

ment proposed in Your Excellency's kind note.

The procedure suggested in the said note to which I refer rests on

the following bases:

"The Selective Training and Service Act of the United States of 1940 provides that, with certain exceptions , every male citizen of the United States and every other male domiciled in the United States , between the ages of eighteen and sixty-five, must be registered . The Act provides, further, that, with certain exceptions , males registered between certain specified age limits, are subject. to active military service in the armed forces of the United States. "The Government of the United States of America recognizes that from the point of view of the morale of the individuals mentioned and the primordial military effort of the nations at war with the Axis powers, it would be desirable to permit certain nationals of the co-belligerent countries, who are now registered or who may be registered under the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, to enlist in the armed forces of their own country, if
they so desire. It will be recalled that during the World War the United States Government signed conventions with various associated powers on this subject. The United States Government believes, nevertheless , that under the present circumstances, the same purpose may now be attained by administrative action, thus avoiding the delays resulting from the signing and ratification of conventions. "The United States Government is prepared, consequently, to initiate a procedure to permit aliens who have registered under the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 , as amended , and who are nationals of co-belligerent countries and who have not declared their intention of becoming United States citizens , to choose to serve in the forces of their respective countries instead of serving in the forces of the United States , on any date anterior to their enrolment in the armed forces of the United States. The Government of the United States is also prepared to offer to nationals of co -belligerent countries, who have not declared their intention of becoming citizens of the United States and who are now serving in the armed forces of the United States, an opportunity to elect their transfer to the armed forces of their own country. The details of the arrangement are to be agreed upon directly between the War Department and the Selective

Service System, on the part of the Government of the United States, and the respective authorities of the Salvadoran Government. It must be understood , nevertheless , that in all cases in which a person exercises the option contemplated in this arrangement, such option must be accepted by the military authorities. of the government of his nationality before his departure from the United States is permitted . "
In accordance with the bases which have just been copied , Your Excellency informs me, in the same note of April 3 , that before the above-mentioned procedure comes into force between our two Governments, the Department of State desires to receive from the undersigned, as Diplomatic Representative of El Salvador in the United States, a note declaring that the Government of El Salvador desires to avail itself of the same procedure and that , on doing so , it agrees to the following :
(a) "No effort shall be made by the Government of El Salvador to induce any person in the United States to enlist in its own forces or in those of any foreign Government ;
(b) "Reciprocal treatment shall be granted by the Government of El Salvador to the citizens of the United States of America, that is, prior to the enrolment in the armed forces of their Government, they shall be offered the opportunity to elect service in the armed forces of the United States in a manner substantially like that above described . Furthermore, the Government of El Salvador agrees to inform all citizens of the United States who are serving in its armed forces , as well as former citizens of the United States who may have lost their nationality as a result of having taken an oath of loyalty on enlisting in such armed forces, in which they are serving, that they can now be transferred to the armed forces of the United States, if they so desire and on condition that they are acceptable to the armed forces of the United States . The arrangements for making such transfers are to be made between the corresponding representatives of the armed forces of our respective Governments ;

Supplementary agreement between the United States of America and the Netherlands respecting principles applying to the provision of aid to the armed forces of the United States. Effected by exchange of notes signed at Washington June 14 , 1943; effective July 8, 1942.

June 14, 1943 [E. A. S. 326]

The Netherlands Ambassador to the Secretary of State

NETHERLANDS EMBASSY WASHINGTON , D.C.

GA 1928

JUNE 14 , 1943

SIR :

In the United Nations' declaration of January 1 , 1942 , the contracting governments pledged themselves to employ their full resources, military or economic, against those nations with which they are at war ; and in the Agreement of July 8, 1942 between the Governments of the United States and of the Netherlands , on the Principles Applying to Mutual Aid in the Prosecution of the War against Aggression, each contracting government undertook to provide the other with such articles, services, facilities , or information useful in the prosecution of their common war effort as it might be in a position to supply. It is the understanding of the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands that the general principle to be followed in providing mutual aid as set forth in the said Agreement of July 8 , 1942 is that the war production and the war resources of both Nations should be used by each in ways which most effectively utilize the available materials , manpower, production facilities and shipping space.
With a view, therefore, to supplementing the Agreement of July 8, 1942 , I have the honor to set forth below the understanding of the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands of the principles and procedures applicable to the provision of aid by the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands to the armed forces of the United States and the manner in which such aid will be correlated with the maintenance of those forces by the United States Government .

1. The Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, retaining the right of final decision , in the light of its own potentialities and responsibilities , will provide the United States or its forces with the following types of assistance as such reciprocal aid , when and to the extent that it is found that they can most effectively be procured in territory of the Kingdom of the Netherlands :

55 Stat. 1600. 56 Stat. 1554.

(a) Supplies, materials , facilities , information and services for the United States forces except for the pay and allowances of such forces, administrative expenses, and such local purchases as its official establishments may make other than through the official establishments of the Government of the Netherlands as specified in paragraph 2.

992

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [57 STAT.

(b) Supplies, materials , information and services needed in the construction of military projects, tasks and similar capital works required for the common war effort in territory of the Kingdom of the Netherlands , except for the wages and salaries of United States citizens .
(c) Supplies , materials, information and services needed in the construction of such military projects, tasks and capital works in territory other than territory of the Kingdom of the Netherlands or territory of the United States , to the extent that territory of the Kingdom of the Netherlands is a more practicable source of supply than the United States , or another of the United Nations.

2. The practical application of the principles formulated in this

note, including the procedure by which requests for aid by either Government are made and acted upon , shall be worked out as occasion may require by agreement between the two Governments, acting

when possible through their appropriate military or civilian administrative authorities . Requests by the United States Government for such aid will be presented by duly authorized authorities of the United States to official agencies of the Netherlands which will be designated or established in Washington, or in the areas where United States forces are located , for the purpose of facilitating the provision of reciprocal aid. 3. It is the understanding of the Government of the Kingdom of

the Netherlands that all such aid, as well as other aid , including information , received under Article 6 of the Agreement of July 8,

56 Stat. 1555. 1942 , accepted by the President of the United States or his authorized

representatives from the Government of the Netherlands will be

received as a benefit to the United States under the Act of March 11 ,

55 Stat. 31. 22 U. 8. C., Supp. 1941. In so far as circumstances will permit, appropriate record of

II, §§411-419. Ante, p. 20.

aid received under this arrangement will be kept by each Government.

If the Government of the United States concurs in the foregoing,

I would suggest that the present note and your reply to that effect

be regarded as placing on record the understanding of our two Govern-

ments in this matter and that for clarity and convenience of adminis-

tration this understanding be considered to be effective as from

July 8 , 1942 , the date of the Agreement of the two Governments on the principles of mutual aid .

Accept, Sir, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration.

State with respect to the application of the United States Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 , as amended, to Brazilian nationals residing in the United States.
As you are aware, the Act provides that with certain exceptions every male citizen of the United States and every other male person

residing in the United States between the ages of eighteen and sixtyfive shall register. The Act further provides that, with certain exceptions, registrants within specified age limits are liable for active military service in the United States armed forces.

This Government recognizes that from the standpoint of morale of the individuals concerned and the over-all military effort of the countries at war with the Axis Powers, it would be desirable to permit certain nationals of cobelligerent countries who have registered or who may register under the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 , as amended , to enlist in the armed forces of their own country, should they desire to do so . It will be recalled that during the World War this Government signed conventions with certain associated powers on this subject. The United States Government believes,

however, that under existing circumstances the same ends may now

be accomplished through administrative action , thus obviating the

delays incident to the signing and ratification of conventions.

ligerent countries.

This Government is prepared , therefore , to initiate a procedure

cobelligerent countries and who have not declared their intention of

becoming American citizens to elect to serve in the forces of their

respective countries, in lieu of service in the armed forces of the

United States, at any time prior to their induction into the armed forces of this country . This Government is also prepared to afford to nationals of cobelligerent countries who have not declared their

intention of becoming American citizens who may already be serving in the armed forces of the United States an opportunity of electing

to transfer to the armed forces of their own country. The details of

the arrangement are to be worked out directly between the War

Department and the Selective Service System on the part of the

United States Government and the appropriate authorities of the

Brazilian Government. It should be understood, however , that in

all cases a person exercising an option under the arrangement must

actually be accepted by the military authorities of the country of his

allegiance before his departure from the United States.

from the diplomatic representative in Washington of that country a

note stating that his government desires to avail itself of the procedure

and in so doing agrees that :

(a) No threat or compulsion of any nature will be exercised by his government to induce any person in the United States to enlist in the forces of his or any foreign government ;
(b) Reciprocal treatment will be granted to American citizens by his government ; that is, prior to induction in the armed forces
of his government they will be granted the opportunity of electing to serve in the armed forces of the United States in substantially the same manner as outlined above . Furthermore, his government shall agree to inform all American citizens serving in its armed forces or former American citizens who may have lost their citizenship as a result of having taken an oath of allegiance on enlistment in such armed forces and who are now serving in those forces that they may transfer to the armed forces of the United States provided they desire to do so and provided they are acceptable to the armed forces of the United States . The arrangements for effecting such transfers are to be worked out by the appropriate representatives of the armed forces of the respective governments ;
(c) No enlistments will be accepted in the United States by his government of American citizens subject to registration or of aliens of any nationality who have declared their intention of
becoming American citizens and are subject to registration .

This Government is prepared to make the proposed regime effective immediately with respect to Brazil upon the receipt from you of a note stating that your Government desires to participate in it and agrees to the stipulations set forth in lettered paragraphs (a) , (b) , and (c) above.

1) o Governo brasileiro intende que o acordo deve ser considerado como reciproco sob todos os aspétos e que as garantias solicitadas ao Governo brasileiro na referida nota são implicitamente dadas também pelo Govêrno dos Estados Unidos , e
2 ) o Governo brasileiro não póde assumir o encargo de informar todos os cidadãos americanos em serviço nas suas forças armadas ou cidadãos americanos que por ventura tenham perdido sua cidadânia em consequência de terem prestado juramento nas forças brasileiras e estejam atualmente servindo nessas forças armadas, de que podem ser transferidos para as forças armadas dos Estados Unidos , se assim o desejam e sejam aceitos pelas forças armadas dos Estados Unidos. Da mesma forma, nenhuma notificação será exigida com relação aos cidadãos brasileiros que estejam por ventura servindo nas forças armadas dos Estados Unidos ou venham a ser sujeitos ao serviço militar sob as leis dos Estados Unidos .

3. Espera o Governo brasileiro, contudo , possam os cidadãos brasileiros já incorporados ou convocados para o exército dos Estados Unidos, exercer, em virtude do presente acôrdo , opção para servir nas forças armadas do Brasil.

MR . SECRETARY OF STATE :

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of the note of the 23rd day of January last whereby Your Excellency states that the Government of the United States of America is disposed to initiate a proceeding in favor of foreigners registered by virtue of the Selective Service Act of 1940 who are citizens of cobelligerent countries and who have not declared an intention of becoming naturalized Americans, for the exercise of the option of serving in the armed forces of their respective countries or of being transferred to them. 2.

SIR :

July 19, 1943

I have the honor to inform you that the Honorable Anthony J. Dimond, Delegate of Alaska, United States House of Representatives , has proposed that the highway from Dawson Creek, British Columbia, to Fairbanks , Alaska , be given the official name " Alaska Highway" .
The Government of the United States believes that the name sug-

It is of the further opinion that the highway should be jointly named by the Governments of the United States and Canada in view of the location of the greater part of the highway within Canada and in view of the friendly cooperation which has made possible its construction .

In accordance with the foregoing, I have the honor to propose that

the highway from Dawson Creek, British Columbia , to Fairbanks ,

Alaska, be designated the " Alaska Highway". If the Canadian

Government is agreeable to this proposal, it is suggested that this

note and your reply in that sense shall be considered as placing on

57 STAT. ] GREAT BRITAIN-AFRICAN ASBESTOS - APR. 30, 1943 MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING

1. Statement of Principle

6TH JANUARY, 1943 .

The Government of the United States of America and the Govern-

ment of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland agree so to regulate the importation of African asbestos and take such

other practicable steps as to apportion supplies in accordance with the following principles : -

(a) Where 1943 production is adequate supplies will be so apportioned as to enable each of the Governments to create, by 1st January, 1944 , stocks (whether privately or publicly owned) of each grade of asbestos equivalent to one year's consumption.
(b) Where 1943 production of a particular kind of asbestos is inadequate to achieve this objective , the apportionment of available supplies shall be made with reference to the relative importance to the war production programmes of the respective Governments of the uses of that asbestos . It is agreed , therefore , that the requirements of H.M.G. in U.K. for supplies of blue M.S. and S. asbestos shall be given prior consideration and , conversely, that requirements of the U.S.G. for supplies of amosite shall be given prior consideration.
(c) Necessary requirements of the other friendly nations for raw African asbestos fibre (as stated in the Appendices) shall be met to

the extent of available supplies. (d ) When, as a result of inadequate supplies , the requirements of
either Government are not fully met in any grade, such Government may, at its option and in agreement with the other Government , secure equivalent quantities of other grades by way of replacement for its reserve, if there are available surpluses after essential war requirements have been met.

(e) Any surpluses of available 1943 supplies remaining after meeting the stock-pile objectives of U.S.G. and H.M.G. after meeting the necessary requirements of other nations and after providing for such additional quantities as may be secured by the respective Governments pursuant to sub-paragraph (d) above shall be apportioned between the U.S.G. and H.M.G. in U.K. in proportion to the estimated consumption in the U.S. and the U.K.
(f) Available supplies in 1944 and thereafter shall be apportioned between the U.S.G. and H.M.G. in U.K. in proportion to the estimated consumption in the U.S. and the U.K. after allowing for quantities in stock or estimated to be in stock at 31st December, 1943 , and allowing for the necessary requirements of friendly nations .
(g) The nominal requirements of the U.S.G. for blue A and C asbestos shall be met in full in 1943 .

(h) In apportioning the various types of chrysotile asbestos within any particular grade (as for example in apportioning quantities of C. and G.2, H.V.L.2. and V.R.A.2 consideration shall be given to the

1025

1026

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [ 57 STAT.
interchangeability of the grades in the U.K. and to the unfamiliarity of the U.S. manufacturing companies with grades other than C. and G. The U.S.G. will in 1943 use its best efforts to induce the manufacturers to run manufacturing tests to ascertain the interchangeability and usability of grades other than C. and G. The U.S.G. and H.M.G. will encourage the full interchange of technical information . Any limitation of the quantities of V.R.A. or H.V.L. grades which may be delivered to the U.S.A. in 1943 is agreed without prejudice to the producers ' claim that these grades are fully interchangeable with the C. & G. grades.
2. Apportionment of Supplies Appendix 1 sets forth the agreed apportionment of supplies between U.S.A. , U.K. , the Empire and neutral destinations . This apportionment has been calculated in accordance with the principles set forth in paragraph 1 . 3. Insofar as the requirements of the U.K. for African asbestos have been stated on the assumption of the continuance as hitherto of Canadian supplies , the respective Governments agree that the apportionments are subject to review in the event that adequate supplies of Canadian fibre are not forthcoming.
4. Assurances of Blue Production
In view of the real shortage in supplies of blue M.S. and S. grades , all practicable steps will be taken to increase blue M.S. and S. production to levels adequate to provide for the current essential requirements of the U.S. and the U.K. and, if possible, to provide for minimum reserve stocks .
5. Assurance of Chrysotile, (C. and G. ) Production In view of the high importance attached by users for important war production to the C. and G.1 and 2 grades, the production of these grades will be closely watched and every effort made to secure maintenance of production at an adequate level.
6. Exchange of Information (a) Information Furnished by U.S.G.
The U.S.G. undertakes to furnish to H.M.G. within 60 days after the end of each three months ' period a statement, by grades, of the receipts, consumption and stocks of African asbestos in the United States and of afloats and sinkings. The first such statement shall be made as of 31st December, 1942 .
(b) Information Furnished by H.M.G. H.M.G. in U.K. undertakes to furnish to the U.S.G. within 60 days after the end of each three months ' period a statement, by grades , of the receipts, consumption and stocks of African asbestos in the

57 STAT. ] GREAT BRITAIN-AFRICAN ASBESTOS- APR. 30, 1943
United Kingdom and of afloats and sinkings . The first such statement shall be made as of 31st December, 1942. Quarterly statements will also be furnished to the U.S.G. of mining production and African stocks of the African producers .
7. Provision for Review of Apportionments Upon exchange of information as to receipts , consumption , stocks , afloats and sinkings , either Government may request a review of the apportionment in any grade of African asbestos , to bring the actual position into line with the principles set forth in paragraph 1 .
8. Appointment of Representatives The U.S.G. and H.M.G. in U.K. will appoint a representative each to recommend the re-apportionment outlined in paragraph 7 above , or to adjust difficulties of interpretation of this agreement which may arise from time to time.
9. Agreements between Metals Reserve Company and Producing Companies
H.M.G. in U.K. takes note of the agreements entered into between Metals Reserve Company on the one hand and Cape Asbestos Company and Raw Asbestos Distributors on the other dated 22nd December , 1942 , and 18th December , 1942 , respectively and finds them to be in accord with the spirit of this agreement . The U.S.G. undertakes to provide H.M.G. in U.K. with copies of such contracts and of any documents bearing on the interpretation or extension of those contracts .
10. Provision for review by C.R.M.B. The terms of this Agreement are subject to any action which may be taken at any time by the C.R.M.B.
11. Duration of Agreement Except by mutual consent , this agreement shall terminate nine months after the cessation of hostilities. The disposition of stocks remaining in the two countries shall be the subject of full and mutual discussion between U.S.G. and H.M.G. in U.K.

Agreement between the United States of America and Canada respecting
Provincial and municipal taxation on United States defense projects in Canada. Effected by exchange of notes signed at Ottawa August 6 and 9, 1943.

August 6, 9, 1943 [E. A. S. 339]

The Canadian Secretary of State for External Affairs to the American Minister

DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS
CANADA

No. 91 SIR,

OTTAWA, August 6th, 1943.

I have the honour to refer to your note No. 859 of March 23rd [ ¹ ]

and to your subsequent note No. 902 of May 29th , [ 1 ] concerning the possibility of exempting from Provincial and municipal taxation the United States Government and United States contractors engaged

on the Alaska Highway and other United States defence projects in Canada. The Canadian Government is anxious to reach a settlement

of this question which is fair to all parties concerned and which is in keeping with the spirit of mutual helpfulness which has animated both Governments with regard to the defence projects.
2. In the view of the Canadian Government the United States

Government itself cannot be effectively taxed by Provincial or munic-

ipal authorities. If in any instance an attempt is made by those authorities to tax the United States Government either in respect of

real property which it owns or of which it is a lessee, or in respect of licence fees on motor vehicles owned by the United States Government , the Canadian Government will intervene in the legal proceedings

and request the Court to accord appropriate immunities. Should the Court hold, contrary to the expectations of the Canadian Government, that the United States Government is legally liable to pay such taxes or licence fees, the Canadian Government will, as a contribution to

the general costs of the defence projects, reimburse the United States Government for any Provincial or municipal taxes levied in respect of such projects which the United States Government had been held

liable to pay and had paid. 3. In order to keep the record clear it might be well to point out
that the Canadian Government does not consider that any exemption

from municipal taxation would be appropriate in the case of owners of property who have leased it to the United States Government . In cases in which improvements have been made on property so leased ,

1 ¹

[Not

printed . ]

1066

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [ 57 STAT.
assessments will normally be made against the owner who is legally bound to pay the taxes exactly as he would be if the lessee were the Canadian and not the United States Government.
4. United States contractors employed by the United States Government on its military projects in Canada are, of course, legally bound to pay whatever municipal taxes may be assessed against them as owners or lease-holders of property and whatever municipal fees may be charged for building permits in connection with these lands. The Canadian Government will undertake to refund to the United States Government any amounts which that Government may pay to United States contractors in respect of this taxation. Any such payments made by the Canadian Government will form part of its contribution to the cost of the defence projects.
5. The Canadian Government will also reimburse the United States
Government for any payments which it may have to make to United States contractors in respect of licence fees for motor vehicles employed on the United States defence projects in Canada . Any such payments made by the Canadian Government will form part of its contribution to the cost of the defence projects.
6. The Governments of the Provinces in which United States projects are being executed will be requested by the Government of Canada not to impose licence fees on non-military drivers of trucks belonging to the United States Army and not to levy head or poll taxes upon non-military personnel normally resident in the United States which is engaged on United States military projects in Canada. It appears that in the Province of Alberta the poll tax is devoted to educational purposes and the exemption of United States non-military personnel from this tax will carry with it a liability to pay school fees should any of the United States personnel wish to send their children to public schools in the Province.
7. I should be glad to receive your assurance that these proposals for dealing with the problem of the burden of Provincial and municipal taxation on United States defence projects in Canada will meet the wishes of the United States Government.
Accept , Sir, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration. NA ROBERTSON

Effected by exchange of notes signed at Washington June 23 and September 2, 1943; effective June 29, 1943.

EXCELLENCY :

DEPARTMENT OF STATE WASHINGTON June 23, 1943

I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your note of May 13 ,

1943 [ 1 ] in which you conveyed the request of your Government for renewal of the agreement entered into on June 29 , 1940 and extended by an exchange of notes on June 29 , 1941 [ 2 ] for a period of two years between the Governments of Argentina and the United States, providing for the detail of United States Army Air Corps Officers to assist the Argentine Ministry of War.
It is noted that Your Excellency's Government desires to renew this agreement for a period of two years, the renewal to commence upon the termination of the present agreement on June 29 , 1943. I

am pleased to inform you that this arrangement is entirely acceptable to this Government in spite of the provision of Article 3 of the agreement now in force.

In view of the acceptance by the Argentine Ministry of War of the proposal of this Government for the substitution of personnel , it is understood that it will be entirely satisfactory to Your Government to omit the word "regular" in the first paragraph of the

agreement. It is also the understanding of this Government that as a result of discussions between appropriate officials, Title III , Article 20 shall be so amended as to allow free entry into Argentina

of such articles and items as are furnished by the United States Government to the Mission for the use of the latter in the performance of its official duties.
I shall appreciate it if Your Excellency will confirm the acceptance of these modifications.

Accept, Excellency, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration.

Two points were raised in Your Excellency's note. With regard to the first, it will be entirely satisfactory to my Government to omit the word " regular" in the first paragraph of the agreement.
With reference to the second point, that is, the free entry into Argentina of such articles and items as are furnished by the United States Government to the Mission for the use of the latter in the
performance of its duties, my Government directs me to say : 1. That it will be pleased to consider favorably the requests for the free entry of personal effects, furniture, furnishings and luggage-- including a used motorcar of the member of the Mission and his family ; and 2. That whilst the Argentine Department concerned is not authorized to grant the right of free entry in general terms , it will be pleased to grant the free entry (of such materials as are referred to in Your Excellency's note ) upon request and prior knowledge of their nature in each case.

Accept, Excellency, the assurances of my highest consideration . FELIPE A. ESPIL

with certain exceptions, registrants within specified age limits are liable for active military service in the United States armed forces .

This Government recognizes that from the standpoint of morale of the individuals concerned and the over-all military effort of the countries at war with the Axis Powers, it would be desirable to permit certain classes of individuals who have registered or who may register

under the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, as amended , to enlist in the armed forces of a co-belligerent country, should they desire to do so. It will be recalled that during the World War this Govern-

ment signed conventions with certain associated powers on this subject. The United States Government believes, however, that under existing

This Government is prepared , therefore, to initiate a procedure which will permit aliens who have registered under the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, as amended , who are nationals of co-

belligerent countries and who have not declared their intention of becoming American citizens to elect to serve in the forces of their respective countries, in lieu of service in the armed forces of the

United States , at any time prior to their induction into the armed

forces of this country. Individuals who so elect will be physically examined by the armed forces of the United States, and if found physically qualified , the results of such examinations will be forwarded to the proper authorities of the co-belligerent nation for determination

of acceptability . Upon receipt of notification that an individual is acceptable and also receipt of the necessary travel and meal vouchers

from the co-belligerent government involved , the appropriate State Director of the Selective Service System will direct the local Selective

cual se me llama la atención hacia las estipulaciones de la ley pública 375 de los Estados Unidos , del 26 de diciembre de 1941 , que provee la

cooperación de los Estados Unidos con las Repúblicas centroamericanas para la construcción de la carretera interamericana .

Aunque ya hay camino continuo a través de Guatemala , se ha informado a mi Gobierno que es muy de desearse el mejoramiento de algunas secciones de esa vía , para que se ajuste a los tipos de construcción considerados para la carretera interamericana. Por eso , desea mi

Gobierno pedir la cooperación del Gobierno de los Estados Unidos , conforme a las provisiones de esa ley, de acuerdo con los siguientes términos :

1 ) El Gobierno de la República de Guatemala acepta gustoso que ingenieros designados por los dos Gobiernos expresen conjuntamente , previo el estudio que tengan por conveniente, cuáles son las reformas que deben hacerse en cada sección de la vía panamericana que el Gobierno de Guatemala ha construído . Mi Gobierno asumiría la obligación de pagar la tercera parte del costo de la obra , siempre que dicha obra se ejecute acomodándola a las cantidades que el presupuesto de la República determine y fije para cada año fiscal.
2 ) El Gobierno de Guatemala , teniendo presente su situación fiscal y las sumas acordadas por la Asamblea Legislativa para el mejoramiento de la carretera , pedirá la cooperación del Gobierno de
los Estados Unidos para realizar ese mejoramiento de las secciones de la carretera .
3 ) El Gobierno de Guatemala acepta muy agradecido el aporte del Gobierno de los Estados Unidos consistente en el doble de la cantidad
consignada en el presupuesto fiscal de la República de Guatemala para el mejoramiento de la carretera interamericana.

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of Your Excellency's kind Note No. 6756 of May 19, 1943, in which you request the co-

operation of the United States in the improvement of the InterAmerican Highway in Guatemala and in which you propose a basis upon which the cooperation of my Government might be extended within the provisions of Public Law 375 of December 26 , 1941 .

The basis of cooperation proposed by Your Excellency is satisfactory to my Government, and it will be pleased to cooperate on this basis in such survey and construction work as may jointly be

deemed desirable for the improvement of the Guatemalan section of the Inter-American Highway, subject to the appropriation of the necessary funds by the Congress of the United States.

I am much gratified at the prospect that through this cooperative undertaking it will be possible to improve the Guatemalan Section of the Inter-American Highway. Transportation facilities will be

improved , new lands and new natural resources developed , additional markets opened , and local economic conditions benefited through the useful expenditure of money which this project envisages . I sincerely trust that the Highway will serve not only as a link to increase material intercourse between our nations but also as another bond

in the close friendship which unites us .

It is further understood that a special cooperative service of health and sanitation will be established within the Department of State for Health and Public Welfare , and that the detailed arrangements for the establishment of such a special service will be effected by agreement between the appropriate official of the Government of the Dominican Republic and the representative of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs .
Allocation of United States funds for the purpose of this program will be made by the Institute of Inter-American Affairs which is an agency of the Office of the Coordinator of InterAmerican Affairs .

All projects completed in the prosecution of this program will be the property of the Government of the Dominican Republic .
No project will be undertaken that will require materials or supplies, the procurement of which would handicap any phase of the war effort.
I should appreciate it if Your Excellency would be so good as to confirm to me your approval of this general proposal with the understanding that the details of the program will be the subject of further discussion and agreements .
Accept , Excellency, the renewed assurance of my highest consideration.

No. 1426

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA México, D.F., June 30, 1943

EXCELLENCY: Your Excellency will recall that the representatives of the twenty-
one American Republics at the Third Consultative Conference held in Rio de Janeiro in January, 1942 , adopted Resolution No. 30 recommending that health and sanitation problems of the Western Hemisphere be resolved-so far as possible- by means of bi-lateral or multilateral agreements of an international character .

This Resolution, to which our Governments gave decided support, is significant evidence of the importance which the American Republics attribute to collaboration as the most effective method of resolving problems of common interest.

Of singular importance among these problems , especially in the case of neighboring countries, are those referred to in the Rio de

Janeiro Resolution just mentioned , since it is evident that health and

sanitary conditions must necessarily affect both Republics .

Fortunately the relations between the United States and Mexico

are characterized by a sincere cordiality and by well-defined purposes of cooperation, evidenced , among other manifestations, by the author-

ization which Mexico has given for workers of Mexican nationality to render service in various states of the United States during the present

emergency. It therefore appears natural that there should be added to this.
cooperation that other so wisely foreseen by the Republics of this Continent , especially since the tasks to be undertaken are of a longterm nature and cannot be resolved in the course of a few years alone.
In view of the foregoing, I take pleasure in informing Your Excellency that my Government is prepared to collaborate with that of Your Excellency, in a program looking to the development of health and sanitary conditions in Mexico . To this end , it is prepared to supply an amount of Two million five hundred thousand dollars , to be expended, together with the sums which the Mexican Government may set aside and disburse as its equitable contribution to this. enterprise , in the extension and maintenance of the services and of the measures of a sanitary nature, which the dependencies of the Government of Mexico have so efficiently been conducting.

1122 ·

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [57 STAT.

From the conversations held on this subject , my Government has

gained the impression that the Government of Your Excellency would

be principally interested in the inclusion in this program of health

and sanitation , work along the Pan American Highway, as well as the intensification of control and treatment of disease, and the estab-

lishment or extension of those public works related therewith which

may tend to improve sanitary conditions of the country.

I am authorized to state that my Government , acting through the intermediary of the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American

Affairs, if acceptable to the Government of Your Excellency , shall

send a small group of technicians to Mexico for the purpose of developing a specific program in full collaboration with the Government of

Your Excellency, acting through the officials which it may designate for this purpose . This group would be under the immediate direction

of a principal physician , to be known as Chief of the Field Party , and who would work in the closest collaboration with the Department

of Public Health of Mexico .

In order to carry through this collaboration to a satisfactory con-

clusion, it is proposed that the Government of Mexico shall desig-

nate or create an appropriate dependency within the Department

of Public Health for the carrying through of the health and sanitary

projects under reference, as well as for the study of the projects

concerning medical preparation and sanitary engineering, upon which the said officials of the Mexican Government and the Chief of the

Field Party may agree . It is understood that the Government of Mexico shall furnish the technical personnel and the materials , serv-

ices , and funds which it may consider necessary.

The respective Governments, or their duly authorized agencies, would give their approval for the actual undertaking of the projects.

in question, which would be carried through upon certification by the head of the Department of Public Health of Mexico and by the head of the Field Party already mentioned.

Upon completion of the projects entered into , these shall pass to the exclusive ownership of the Government of Mexico .

Accept, Excellency, the reiterated assurances of my highest and

most distinguished consideration .

MÉXICO , D.F. , a 1º de julio de 1943.

SEÑOR EMBAJADOR :

Tengo la honra de acusar recibo a Vuestra Excelencia de su muy

atenta nota número 1426 del 30 de junio último , en la que se sirve manifestarme lo siguiente :

"Como Vuestra Excelencia recordará, en la Tercera Reunión de Consulta celebrada en Río de Janeiro , en enero de 1942 , los Representantes de las 21 Repúblicas Americanas aprobaron la Resolución número 30 , que recomienda que en cuanto sea posible-los problemas de sanidad e higiene del Hemisferio Occidental se resuelvan por medio de convenios bilaterales o multilaterales de índole internacional.
La Resolución aludida, a la que nuestros Gobiernos dieron su decidido apoyo , es prueba evidente de la importancia que las Repúblicas Americanas atribuyen a la colaboración , como el método más efectivo de resolver los problemas de interés común .
Entre estos problemas , tienen singular importancia-especialmente en el caso de naciones vecinas-los que menciona en la Resolución aprobada en Río de Janeiro que acabo de citar, pues es evidente que la sanidad y las condiciones higiénicas forzosamente afectan a ambas Repúblicas .
Afortunadamente , las relaciones entre Estados Unidos y México se caracterizan por una cordialidad sincera y por propósitos bien definidos de cooperación, que se han evidenciado, entre otras manifestaciones , por la autorización que México ha otorgado para que trabajadores de nacionalidad mexicana presten servicios en diversos Estados de la Unión Americana durante la actual emergencia.
Por tanto , parece natural que deba agregarse a esa cooperación , la tan sabiamente prevista por las Repúblicas de este Continente , especialmente porque las tareas que habrán de emprenderse son a largo plazo y no pueden resolverse en el curso de unos cuantos años .
En vista de lo anterior, tengo el placer de comunicar a Vuestra Excelencia que mi Gobierno está dispuesto a colaborar con el de Vuestra Excelencia, en un programa tendiente al mejoramiento de la sanidad y de las condiciones de higiene de México . Para este fin, está dispuesto a suministrar la cantidad de dos millones quinientos mil dólares, que se gastará-junto con las sumas que el Gobierno Mexicano presupueste y desembolse como su aportación equitativa a esta empresa en la ampliación y sostenimiento de esos servicios y en la aplicación de medidas de carácter sanitario, que las Dependencias del Gobierno Mexicano han estado realizando tan eficientemente .
Por las conversaciones celebradas sobre este asunto, mi Gobierno ha recibido la impresión de que el Gobierno de Vuestra Excelencia estaría principalmente interesado en la inclusión en el referido programa de sanidad e higiene de obras a lo largo de la carretera pan-

1123

1124

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [57 STAT.
americana, así como en la intensificación del control y tratamiento de las enfermedades , y en la creación o ampliación de las obras públicas conexas que pudieran tender al mejoramiento de las condiciones sanitarias en el país .
Estoy autorizado para afirmar que mi Gobierno, por conducto de la Oficina del Coordinador de Asuntos Interamericanos , en caso de que esto sea aceptable al Gobierno de Vuestra Excelencia , enviará un reducido grupo de técnicos a México con el objeto de desenvolver un programa específico, en completa colaboración con los funcionarios que designe el Gobierno de Vuestra Excelencia para este fin . El grupo de referencia estaría bajo la dirección inmediata de un médico en jefe , al que se conocería como "Jefe de la Misión de Campo " y trabajaría en la más estrecha colaboración con el Departamento de Salubridad Pública de México .
Con el objeto de llevar a buen término esta colaboración , se sugiere que el Gobierno de México designe o establezca una dependencia apropiada, dentro del Departamento de Salubridad Pública, para la realización de los proyectos de sanidad y saneamiento a que se hace alusión , así como para el estudio de los proyectos concercientes a la preparación de médicos y a la ingeniería sanitaria , en que pudieran convenir los referidos funcionarios del Gobierno Mexicano y el Jefe de la Misión de Campo . Queda entendido que el Gobierno Mexicano suministrará el personal técnico y los materiales , servicios y fondos que pudiera estimar necesarios .
Los Gobiernos respectivos , o sus dependencias debidamente autorizadas, darían su aprobación para la realización efectiva de los proyectos en cuestión , que se llevarían a cabo previa certificación del Jefe del Departamento de Salubridad Pública de México y del Jefe de la Misión de Campo , ya mencionado.
A la terminación de los proyectos emprendidos , éstos pasarán a ser propiedad exclusiva del Gobierno de México .
Aceptad, Excelencia , las seguridades reiteradas de mi más alta y más distinguida consideración".
Al dar a Vuestra Excelencia las más cumplidas gracias por haber señalado a mi consideración tan importante asunto , le ruego se sirva tomar nota y comunicarlo así a su Gobierno que el de México , convencido de que los resultados de la inversión de estos fondos se traducirán en beneficio de nuestros dos países-, acepta muy reconocido esta nueva prueba del espíritu de amplia cooperación que norma las relaciones de nuestros pueblos .
Renuevo a Vuestra Excelencia el testimonio de mi más alta y distinguida consideración.

Se entiende que los empleadores cooperarán para llevar a cabo este arreglo , con aquellas Agencias del Gobierno Norteamericano cuyos poderes, según las leyes de los Estados Unidos de América, les permitan contribuir a la realización del mismo.
Los respectivos Gobiernos pueden denunciar el arreglo que se efectúe sobre las recomendaciones aquí consignadas, dando el aviso correspondiente con noventa días de anticipación.

En caso de que Vuestra Excelencia, como lo espero, considere aceptable el texto del arreglo tal como queda descrito en los párrafos anteriores bastará que así me lo comunique por escrito para que el mismo entre en vigor.

EMBASSY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

EXCELLENCY :

I have the honor to refer to the note No. 317 dated April 26 , 1943 in which Your Excellency formulates certain proposals made by the Mexican Government for making the Agreement of August 4, 1942 between the Governments of the United States of America and Mexico

a more workable instrument under which Mexican agricultural workers may be recruited in Mexico to work in the United States for a temporary period .

The United States representatives who have been discussing the proposed changes with the representatives designated by the Mexican Government for this purpose have been gratified by the generous spirit of cooperation which has animated these discussions and which has helped to bring them to a successful conclusion.

I am incorporating into this note the text of the Agreement of

August 4 , 1942 and indicating by underlining those additions or changes agreed upon by my Government :

"In order to effect a satisfactory arrangement whereby Mexican agricultural labor may be made available for use in the United States and at the same time provide means whereby this labor will be adequately protected while out of Mexico , the following general provisions are suggested :

"It is specifically understood that the provisions of Section III of Article 29 above-mentioned shall not apply to the Government of the United States notwithstanding the inclusion of this section in the agreement, in view of the obligations assumed by the United States Government under Transportation (a) and (c) of this agreement .

The respective agencies of the Government of the United States shall be responsible for the safekeeping of the sums contributed by the Mexican workers toward the formation of their Rural Savings Fund, until such sums are transferred to the Wells Fargo Bank and Union Trust Company of San Francisco for the account of the Bank of Mexico , S. A. , which will transfer such amounts to the Mexican Agricultural Credit Bank. This last shall assume responsibility for the deposit, for the safekeeping and for the application , or in the absence of these , for the return of such amounts .
"b. The Mexican Government through the Banco de Crédito Agrícola will take care of the security of the savings of the workers to be used for payment of the agricultural implements , which may be made available to the Banco de Crédito Agrícola in accordance with exportation permits for shipment to Mexico with the understanding that the Farm Security Administration will recommend priority treatment for such implements..
"Numbers
"As it is impossible to determine at this time the number of workers who may be needed in the United States for agricultural labor employment, the employer shall advise the Mexican Government from time to time as to the number needed . The Government of Mexico shall determine in each case the number of workers who may leave the country without detriment to its national economy .
"General Considerations
"It is understood that, with reference to the departure from Mexico of Mexican workers , who are not farm laborers, there shall govern in understandings reached by agencies of the respective Governments the same fundamental principles which have been applied here to the departure of farm labor.
"It is understood that the employers will cooperate with such other agencies of the Government of the United States in carrying this understanding into effect whose authority under the laws of the United States are such as to contribute to the effectuation of the understanding.

In accepting the above text as the arrangement under which Mexican Agricultural workers shall be recruited and employed in agricultural work in the United States my Government agrees that all the conditions set forth in the revised agreement will apply equally to those agricultural workers already in the United States or on their way to the United States under individual work agreements as well as to those who may be recruited for such work in the future.
Accept, Excellency, the renewed assurances of my highest and most distinguished consideration.

Agreement between the United States of America and the Dominican Republic respecting workmen's compensation in connection with certain projects under construction or operation in the Dominican Republic. Effected by exchange of notes signed at Ciudad Trujillo October 14 and 19, 1943.

The American Chargé d'Affaires ad interim to the Dominican Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs

No. 141

EMBASSY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Ciudad Trujillo , D.R. , October 14 , 1943

EXCELLENCY:
I have the honor to refer to conversations which have taken place between officers of the Dominican Department of State for Foreign
Affairs and of the Embassy with respect to compensation benefits which may be claimed by American citizens employed on projects under construction or operation by cost plus contractors with the Government of the United States in the Dominican Republic.
The Congress of the United States by Public Law 208 , 77th Con10535 .Stat . 622; 56 Stat . gress , as amended by Public Law 784, 77th Congress , has proII4, 2§§U.16581.-1C65.4.Supp. vided a mandatory and uniform system of compensation benefits as
44 Stat. 1424. 33 U. S. C. §§ 901- embodied in the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers ' Act , and 950.
administered by the United States Employees' Compensation Commission for American nationals employed by contractors in foreign
countries on or in connection with United States Government projects. The purpose of this legislation was two-fold (1 ) to insure that all
American workmen engaged outside the United States on these Government projects would be treated equally and (2 ) since these American workmen have rights under the compensation acts of the country in which they are working in the absence of some arrangement with that country, there is every possibility of an American workman collecting double benefits . Such double benefits would be ultimately paid for by the United States Government since the contracts above referred to are on a cost-plus-a-fixed -fee basis under which the Government reimburses for such expenditures .
Furthermore , in view of the fact that these workmen performing work in foreign countries are there temporarily it is necessary to
provide them and their families (in the event of their death ) with a system of benefits administered in the United States as well as in foreign countries, as is the situation under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers ' Act . This is particularly true since in the event of a workman's disability or death , as the case may be, compensation pay-
ments to himself or dependents will continue for a long period of years. If some such arrangement had not been made by Congress (in the passage of Public Laws 208 and 784 hereinabove referred to ) it would

57 STAT.] DOMINICAN REPUBLIC-WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION--OCT. 14, 19, 1943 1181

have been necessary for American workmen or their families to return to foreign countries in order to litigate or collect local compensation benefits .
It is the desire of the Government of the United States that Public

Law 208, 77th Congress, as amended by Public Law 784 , 77th Congress , will be made the exclusive remedy for workman's compensation , injury or death therein of American employees of American contractors with the United States Government.
Inasmuch as the insurance furnished these American employers is written by American companies it would be appreciated if Your Excellency's government would permit American insurance companies to service the insured risks involved , by furnishing claim adjustors and safety engineers and to maintain any facilities that may be necessary solely and only for such purpose.
I avail myself of the opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the assurances of my highest and most distinguished consideration .

SEÑOR ENCARGADO DE NEGOCIOS :

Compláceme avisar recibo a Vuestra Señoría de la nota Núm. 141 , del 14 de octubre en curso , mediante la cual esa Embajada , a nombre del Gobierno de los Estados Unidos , dirige al Gobierno dominicano la solicitud que a continuación se reproduce , en su traducción al español :
"Excelencia :Tengo el honor de referirme a las conversaciones sostenidas
entre Funcionarios de esa Secretaría de Estado de Relaciones Exteriores y de esta Embajada , con respecto a las indemnizaciones que puedan ser reclamadas por ciudadanos americanos , empleados en proyectos de construcción u operación en la República Dominicana por contratistas asalariados de los Estados Unidos .
El Congreso de los Estados Unidos , por Ley Núm . 208 , enmendada por la Ley 784 , ambas de la 77ma . Legislatura , ha establecido un sistema obligatorio e uniforme de compensaciones , como lo constituye la Ley de Estivadores y Obreros Portuarios , administrado por la Comisión de Compensaciones de Empleados Estadounidenses en favor de los nacionales americanos al servicio

1182

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [ 57 STAT.
de contratistas en el exterior o en conexión con proyectos del Gobierno de los Estados Unidos .
Esta legislación tuvo dos propósitos : 1 ) Asegurar que todos los obreros americanos empleados fuera de los Estados Unidos recibiesen un trato igual y 2 ) , puesto que esos obreros americanos tienen el derecho de acogerse a las leyes de seguro del país donde trabajan, mientras no exista un arreglo con dicho país , que hubiese la posibilidad de que el obrero americano cobrase una doble indemnización . Tales dobles indemnizaciones al fin y al cabo serían pagadas por el Gobierno de los Estados Unidos , puesto que los citados contratos se basan en el "costo de la obra más un honorario fijo ", bajo cuyas condiciones el Gobierno tiene que reembolsar gastos de esa índole .
Además, en vista del hecho que tales obreros se encuentran en esos países extranjeros solo temporalmente, es necesario protegerlos (a ellos y a sus familias en caso de su muerte ) con un sistema de indemnización administrado tanto en los Estados Unidos como en el exterior , de-acuerdo con los requisitos de la Ley de Estivadores y Obreros Portuarios . Esto es necesario , particularmente, en caso de incapacidad o muerte del obrero , según sea el caso , porque la compensación se seguirá pagando a él o sus familiares durante un largo período de años . Si el Congreso no hubiese previsto tales arreglos (al votar las leyes 208 y 784 susodichas ) hubieran tenido que regresar los obreros americanos o sus familias a esos países para litigar o cobrar las compensaciones locales correspondientes .
Es el deseo del Gobierno de los Estados Unidos que la Ley Núm. 208 77mo . Congreso , enmendada por la Ley Núm. 784 de la misma Legislatura , constituya el medio exclusivo que rija las compensaciones por concepto de lesión o muerte de obreros americanos empleados por contratistas americanos dependientes del Gobierno de los Estados Unidos.
Puesto que en los seguros suministrados a estos empresarios americanos el riesgo es asumido por Compañías americanas, se agradecería que el Gobierno de Vuestra Excelencia permita a las Compañías americanas de Seguro asumir los riesgos correspondientes, suministrando ajustadores de reclamaciones e ingenieros de seguridad y manteniendo las facilidades que sean necesarias para ese solo y único propósito .
Aprovecho la oportunidad para renovar a Vuestra Excelencia las seguridades de mi más alta y más distinguida consideración .

Sobre el particular tengo el agrado de llevar a conocimiento de Vuestra Señoría que el Gobierno dominicano consiente, en principio , en la no aplicación de la legislación dominicana de seguros contra accidentes del trabajo en los casos referentes a obreros de nacionalidad americana que trabajen en el territorio de la República Dominicana, empleados por contratistas también de nacionalidad americana que dependan del Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de América, siempre

sobre esta materia tienen carácter de orden público en la legislación

MR. CHARGÉ D'AFFAIRES: I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your note 141 of
October 14 , 1943 , in which the Embassy, in the name of the Government of the United States, transmits to the Dominican Government the request quoted below in Spanish translation:

[Here follows the text of note 141 of October 14 , 1943 from the American Chargé d'Affaires ad interim to the Dominican Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs . ]

In this connection I take pleasure in informing you that the Dominican Government approves , in principle, the inapplicability of Dominican legislation on labor accident insurance in cases con-

cerning laborers of American nationality working in the Dominican Republic , employed by contractors likewise of American nationality under the Government of the United States of America, so long as

the risks run by said workmen are properly covered by the laws of the United States of America.

In this respect and taking into consideration that the legal provisions covering this subject are of a statutory nature in Dominican law, my Government promises your Government that it will take the necessary steps toward effecting a legislative amendment which

will make possible the agreement reached in this manner.

I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to you the assurances

of my most distinguished consideration .

Agreement between the United States of America and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland respecting jurisdiction over criminal offenses committed by armed forces. Effected by exchange of notes signed at London July 27, 1942; effective August 6, 1942.

No. W 10338/13/64.

FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W. 1. 27th July, 1942.

YOUR EXCELLENCY, Jurisdiction of U. S.
Following the discussions which have taken place between repre- authorities, etc.
sentatives of our two Governments , His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom are prepared , subject to the necessary Parliamentary authority, to give effect to the desire of the Government of the United States that the Service courts and authorities of the United States
Forces should , during the continuance of the conflict against our com-
mon enemies , exercise exclusive jurisdiction in respect of criminal offences which may be committed in the United Kingdom by members of those Forces, and they are ready to introduce in Parliament the
necessary legislation for this purpose . Restoration of
2. It is appreciated , however, that cases may arise where for partic- United Kingdom ular reasons the American authorities may prefer that their courts jcuarsiessd.iction in certain should not exercise the above jurisdiction , and His Majesty's Government would accordingly propose that in any case in which a written. communication to that effect is received from the Diplomatic Representative of the United States it should be open to the appropriate
British authority to restore the jurisdiction of the courts of the United Kingdom to deal with that case.
3. In view of the very considerable departure which the above arrangements will involve from the traditional system and practice

of the United Kingdom there are certain points upon which His Majesty's Government consider it indispensable first to reach an
understanding with the United States Government. I have ac-
cordingly the honour to invite Your Excellency to be so good as to
lay the following enquiries and observations before your Government
and to inform me of their attitude thereupon. Assumption of
4. In the first place , the readiness of His Majesty's Government in U.S. willingness totry the United Kingdom to agree to the exercise by United States Service apunndi,sohn. conviction, to courts of exclusive jurisdiction in respect of offences by members of their Forces is based upon the assumption that the United States Service authorities and courts concerned will be able and willing to try and, on conviction , to punish all criminal offences which members of

1194

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [ 57 STAT.

the United States Forces may be alleged on sufficient evidence to have committed in the United Kingdom, and that the United States au-

thorities are agreeable in principle to investigate and deal with appropriately any alleged criminal offence committed by members of the United States Forces in the United Kingdom which may be brought to

their notice by the competent British authorities, or which the Ameri-

can authorities may find to have taken place .

Trial in open court,

etc.

5. Secondly, His Majesty's Government will be glad if you will

confirm their understanding that the trial of any member of the

United States Forces for an offence against a member of the civilian

population would be in open Court (except where security considera-

tions forbade this) and would be arranged to take place promptly in

the United Kingdom and within a reasonable distance from the spot where the offence was alleged to have been committed, so that wit-

nesses should not be required to travel great distances to attend the

hearing.

Offenses committed

prior to Dec. 7, 1941.

6. Thirdly, His Majesty's Government propose that no member of

the United States Forces should be tried in the United Kingdom by a

Service court of the United States of America, for an offence com-

mitted by him before the 7th December, 1941 .

Reciprocal arrange-

ment.

7. Fourthly, while His Majesty's Government in the United King-

dom would not wish to make the arrangements in regard to jurisdic-

tion over members of the United States Forces in this country dependent upon a formal grant of reciprocity in respect of United Kingdom Forces in the territory of the United States of America, I feel that you will appreciate that the considerations which have convinced His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom that the interests of our common cause would be best served by the arrange-

ments which they are prepared to make as regards jurisdiction over American forces in the United Kingdom would be equally applicable in the case of British forces which in the course of the war against our

common enemies may be stationed in territory under American jurisdiction . It would accordingly be very agreeable to His Majesty's

Government in the United Kingdom if you were authorised to inform me that in that case the Government of the United States of America

will be ready to take all steps in their power to ensure to the British forces concerned a position corresponding to that of United States Forces in the United Kingdom under the arrangements which His

Majesty's Government are willing to make. The considerations indicated in paragraph 2 above would naturally apply and His Maj-

esty's Government would be prepared to authorise the Diplomatic

Representative of His Majesty in the United States to notify the

competent American authorities in cases where the appropriate British

authorities preferred not to exercise jurisdiction .

Mutual assistance in preliminary action.

8. Fifthly, the proposal to ensure to the United States Service

courts and authorities by legislation the exclusive exercise of jurisdic-

tion in respect of criminal offences by members of the United States

Forces in the United Kingdom is based upon the further assumption

57 STAT. ] GREAT BRITAIN-CRIMINAL OFFENSES, JURISDICTION-JULY 27, 1942 1195

that satisfactory machinery will be devised between the competent American and British authorities for such mutual assistance as may

be required in making investigations and collecting evidence in respect of offences which members of the United States Forces are alleged to

have committed , or in which they are alleged to be concerned . His

Majesty's Government have no doubt that the United States Government will agree that it would as a general rule be desirable that such

preliminary action should be taken by the British authorities , on behalf of the American authorities , where the witnesses or other

persons from whom it is desired to take statements are not members of the United States Forces . Conversely, His Majesty's Government

trust that they may count upon the assistance of the American authorities in connexion with the prosecution before British courts of persons who are not members of the United States Forces where the

evidence of any member of these Forces is required or where the assistance of the American authorities in the investigation of the case

(including the taking of statements from the American forces ) may be
needed. Extension to British
9. His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom are prepared Colonies and De-
to extend the proposed legislation where necessary to British Colonies pendencies. Exceptions.
and Dependencies under their authority , other than those British

territories in which are situated the United States Military and Naval

Bases leased in pursuance of the Agreement of the 27th March, 1941 , where the question of jurisdiction is already regulated by that

Agreement. I accordingly propose that the foregoing paragraphs of

this note, and your eventual reply, should be regarded as extending

also to the arrangements to be made in the British Colonies and

Dependencies to which the proposed legislation may be applied. 10. Finally , His Majesty's Government propose that the foregoing

may be mutually agreed upon) after the final termination of such con-

SIR: I have the honor to refer to your note of July 27 , 1942 , in which you
inform me that His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom is prepared, subject to the necessary Parliamentary authority, to give effect to the desire of the Government of the United States that American authorities have exclusive jurisdiction in respect to criminal offences which may be committed in the United Kingdom by members of the American Forces. I now have the honor to inform you that my Government agrees to the several understandings which were raised in your note.

In order to avoid all doubt , I wish to point out that the Military and Naval authorities will assume the responsibility to try and on con-

viction to punish all offences which members of the American Forces may be alleged on sufficient evidence to have committed in the United Kingdom .

It is my understanding that the present exchange of notes is regarded as constituting an agreement between the two Governments to which effect shall be given as from the date on which the necessary Parliamentary authority takes effect .

Accept, Sir, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration . JOHN G. WINANT

CAIRO , March 2, 1943.

YOUR EXCELLENCY :

With reference to the request which you have addressed to me in the name of the Government of the United States of America, I have the honour to inform you that the Egyptian Government has decided to accord, for the duration of the war, immunity from jurisdiction in criminal matters to members of the United States Forces in Egypt, in accordance with the following procedure :-
The expression "United States Forces" will include all persons subject to the military and naval law of the United States who are members of the United States armed Forces on Egyptian territory as well as all civilian employees of American nationality who are accompanying the said Forces or serve with them and who are bearers of certificates issued by the competent American authority defining their status . It is understood that the wives and children of the members of the United States Forces do not benefit hereby from any immunity from jurisdiction and will be amenable to the jurisdiction of Egyptian courts .
The immunity from jurisdiction accorded by the Egyptian Government will cover crimes , misdemeanors and police offences committed in Egypt by the members of the United States Forces . However, when the infraction will have been committed by a civilian employee referred to above the Egyptian Government reserves the right , either to turn over the offender to the Egyptian courts or to hand him over to the competent American military authorities .
In cases in which members of the civilian population are victims , a competent American military court sitting in Egypt will judge the case without delay and in public session, unless sittings behind closed doors are necessary for reasons of security. The sentence will be communicated to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs through the good offices of the Legation of the United States.
The American military courts shall not assume jurisdiction over members of the civilian population of Egypt.
The Egyptian Government will undertake, on the written request of the interested American authority, the investigation, arrest and delivery of any member of the United States Forces declared deserter or absent without leave.

1198

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [57 STAT.
Except in cases provided for in the preceding paragraph, the members of the United States Forces may be arrested by the Egyptian authorities only in circumstances which would justify the arrest of civilians of American nationality .
When a member of the United States Forces has been arrested by the Egyptian authorities, the following procedure will apply :-
Notification of the arrest will be made immediately to the competent American military authority together with data regarding the name and other details concerning the person arrested and information regarding the nature of the infractions for which the said person has been arrested . Except when the case is to be submitted to the Egyptian courts, the offender will be delivered to the interested American authority . Complete details of the charges brought against the suspect with the names and addresses of the witnesses and data concerning them will be handed or sent to the interested American authority .
When a member of the United States Forces has been accused of having committed an infraction for which he has not been arrested , the details of this suspected infraction, with the procès-verbal will be communicated as quickly as possible to the competent American military authorities .
The two Governments will extend to each other mutual assistance in investigations concerning infractions which may have been committed by members of the United States Forces or of which they may have been the victims . The Egyptian Government will take at the request of the competent American military authority, all reasonable measures to the end that persons amenable to its jurisdiction appear as witnesses before the American military courts in Egypt ; likewise the Government of the United States will take all reasonable measures to assure the presence of any member of the United States Forces as witnesses at the sessions of the Egyptian courts , and this on request made by the competent official of the Ministry of Justice or by the President of the competent court .
It must be expressly understood that the exceptional regime provided for above is accorded only because of the special situation resulting from the war and that it will terminate in all respects at the end of the war to permit the return to normal law.
In case of acceptance, the present letter and your reply will be considered as constituting an agreement binding our two Governments and will be published in the ' Official Journal'. In my capacity of Military Governor General , I will not fail to take thereafter the necessary internal measures to put this agreement into effect.
I take this opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the assurances of my high consideration .

LE CAIRE, le 2 Mars 1943.

EXCELLENCE ,

Me référant à la demande que vous m'avez adressée au nom du Gouvernement des Etats-Unis d'Amérique, j'ai l'honneur de vous faire connaître que le Gouvernement Egyptien a décidé d'accorder,

pour la durée de la guerre, l'immunité de juridiction en matière pénale , aux membres des Forces des Etats-Unis d'Amérique en Egypte con-

formément aux dispositions ci- après:L'expression "Forces des Etats-Unis" comprendra toute personne
soumise aux lois militaires et navales des Etats-Unis qui est membre des Forces armées des Etats-Unis se trouvant sur le territoire égyptien ainsi que tout fonctionnaire civil de nationalité américaine qui accompagne les dites forces ou sert avec elles et qui est porteur d'un certificat délivré par l'autorité américaine compétente et définissant son statut. Il est entendu que les femmes et enfants des membres

des Forces des Etats-Unis ne bénéficient, à ce titre, d'aucune immunité de juridiction et seront justiciables des tribunaux égyptiens .
L'immunité de juridiction accordée par le Gouvernement couvrira les crimes , délits et contraventions commis en Egypte par les membres des Forces des Etats-Unis . Toutefois , en cas d'infraction commise par un fonctionnaire civil défini ci-haut , le Gouvernement Egyptien se réserve le droit de déférer le coupable aux tribunaux égyptiens ou de le remettre aux autorités militaires américaines compétentes.
Dans le cas où les victimes sont des membres de la population civile, l'affaire sera soumise à un tribunal militaire américain siégeant

en Egypte et jugée sans retard et en audience publique (sauf si le huis

clos est nécessaire pour des raisons de sécurité ) . La sentence sera communiquée au Ministère des Affaires Etrangères par les soins de la Légation des Etats-Unis .

Les tribunaux militaires américains ne pourront juger les membres de la population civile d'Egypte
Le Gouvernement Egyptien assurera, sur la demande écrite de l'autorité américaine intéressée , la recherche, l'arrestation et la livraison de tout membre des Forces des Etats-Unis déclaré déserteur

ou absent sans permission.

Sauf dans les cas prévus à l'alinéa précédent, les membres des

Forces des Etats-Unis ne pourront être arrêtés par les autorités égyptiennes que dans les circonstances qui justifieraient l'arrestation des civils de nationalité américaine .

Lorsqu'un membre des Forces des Etats-Unis aura été arrêté par les autorités égyptiennes , la procédure suivante sera adoptée: -
Notification de l'arrestation sera faite immédiatement à l'autorité

militaire américaine compétente avec indication du nom et autres détails sur la personne arrêtée et des renseignements sur la nature des infrac-

tions pour lesquelles la dite personne a été arrêtée . Sauf dans les cas où l'affaire doit être soumise aux tribunaux égyptiens , le présumé coupable

sera livré à l'autorité américaine intéressée. Les détails complets

1199

1200

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [57 STAT.
des charges portées à l'encontre du présumé coupable avec les nom et adresse des témoins et des indications à leur sujet seront remis ou envoyés à l'autorité américaine intéressée .
Lorsqu'un membre des Forces des Etats-Unis aura été inculpé d'avoir commis une infraction pour laquelle il n'a pas été arrêté, les détails de cette infraction présumée, avec le procès-verbal , seront communiqués aussi rapidement que possible aux autorités militaires américaines compétentes .
Les deux Gouvernements se prêteront mutuelle assistance pour les enquêtes concernant les infractions qui auraient été commises par les membres des Forces des Etats-Unis ou dont ils auraient été victimes . Le Gouvernement Egyptien prendra, à la requête de l'autorité militaire américaine compétente, toutes mesures raisonnables pour que les personnes justiciables de sa juridiction se présentent comme témoins devant les tribunaux militaires américains en Egypte ; de même, le Gouvernement des Etats-Unis prendra toutes les mesures raisonnables pour assurer la présence de tout membre des Forces des EtatsUnis comme témoin aux audiences des tribunaux égyptiens et ce, sur la demande faite par le fonctionnaire compétent du Ministère de la Justice ou par le Président du Tribunal compétent.
Il doit être expressément entendu que le régime d'exception visé plus haut n'est accordé qu'à raison de la situation particulière résultant de la guerre et qu'il se terminera de plein droit à la fin de la guerre pour permettre le retour au droit commun.
En cas d'acceptation , la présente lettre et la réponse de Votre Excellence seront considérées comme constituant un accord liant nos deux Gouvernements et publiées au 'Journal Officiel' . En ma qualité de Gouverneur Général Militaire, je ne manquerai pas de prendre ensuite les dispositions internes nécessaires pour la mise à exécution de cet accord.
Je saisis cette occasion pour vous renouveler, Excellence, les assurances de ma haute considération .

Among the provisions of that agreement is the following (second paragraph from the end) :

that preliminary action should be taken by the Chinese authorities on behalf of the United States authorities where the witnesses or other

persons from whom it is desired to obtain testimony are not members of the United States forces. In prosecutions in Chinese courts of persons who are not members of the United States forces, but where mem-

Agreement between the United States of America and Canada respecting access to Alaska Highway. Effected by exchange of notes signed at Ottawa April 10, 1943.

The American Chargé d'Affaires ad interim to the Canadian Under Secretary of State for External Affairs

LEGATION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

MY DEAR MR. ROBERTSON :

Ottawa, Canada, April 10, 1943.

The question has been raised in Washington as to whether the two phrases found in the American-Canadian exchange of notes of March

17-18 , 1942 , regarding the post-war use of the Alaska Highway, apply equally to the use of the existing Canadian highways which would have to be used in order to reach the southern terminus of the

Alaska Highway from the United States . You will recall that the notes provide that at the conclusion of the
war "that part of the highway which lies in Canada shall become in

all respects an integral part of the Canadian highway system , subject to the understanding that there shall at no time be imposed any discriminatory conditions in relation to the use of the road as between Canadian and United States civilian traffic . "

Elsewhere the Canadian Government agreed "to waive import duties , transit or similar charges on shipments originating in the United States and to be transported over the highway to Alaska, or originating in Alaska and to be transported over the highway to the United States ."

Although it was originally intended that most of the traffic over the Alaska Highway would be routed to Dawson Creek, British Columbia, by rail , it has , as you know, been found expedient to send certain vehicles and transport certain supplies by highway from the United States to Dawson Creek en route to Alaska . My Government feels that it is a natural inference from the language quoted above that United States vehicles should be allowed to use the roads leading from the boundary to the Alaska Highway under conditions similar to those governing the use of the Highway itself.
Sincerely yours , LEWIS CLARK

Charge d'Affaires ad interim.

for External Affairs, Ottawa.

OTTAWA - April 10, 1943.

MY DEAR MR. CLARK, I have received your letter of April 10th, on the question as to
whether the two phrases found in the American-Canadian exchange of notes of March 17-18 , 1942 , regarding the post-war use of the

Alaska Highway, apply equally to the use of the existing Canadian highways which would have to be used in order to reach the southern terminus of the Alaska Highway from the United States .

The notes provide that at the conclusion of the war "that part of

the highway which lies in Canada shall become in all respects an

integral part of the Canadian highway system, subject to the under-

standing that there shall at no time be imposed any discriminatory conditions in relation to the use of the road as between Canadian and United States civilian traffic . "

Elsewhere in the exchange of notes the Canadian Government

agrees "to waive import duties , transit or similar charges on ship-

ments originating in the United States and to be transported over the highway to Alaska, or originating in Alaska and to be transported over the highway to the United States".

You have stated in your letter that although it was originally intended that most of the traffic over the Alaska Highway would be

routed to Dawson Creek, British Columbia, by railway, it has been found expedient to send certain vehicles and transport certain sup-

plies by highway from the United States to Dawson Creek en route

to Alaska. My Government agrees that it is the natural inference

from the language quoted above that United States vehicles should be allowed to use the roads leading from the boundary to the Alaska

Highway under conditions and for purposes similar to those governing

the use of the highway itself. (It may prove necessary, however, for administrative reasons, to designate certain specific roads to be

used in this way. It would not be practicable, for example , that United States trucks should be able to enter Canada at any point

and still receive bonding priviliges on the assumption that they in-

tend eventually to proceed along the Alaska Highway to United States territory) .

Yours sincerely,

NA ROBERTSON

Under Secretary of State for External Affairs.

Paragraph 1 of the Memorandum of Agreement signed on April 11 , 1941 , under the heading "THE SECRETARIA DE AGRICULTURA Y FOMENTO OF THE UNITED MEXICAN STATES AND THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA MUTUALLY AGREE :", provides as follows :
"1.

Department of Agriculture, United States of America , dated April 11 , 1941 , more than a million locally produced and imported seeds of Hevea brasiliensis and several thousand imported trees budded to

high-yielding clones of Hevea have been planted in nurseries of the

central rubber experiment station , El Palmar, Veracruz , established

in 1941 for rubber plant research and practical development of a

Hevea rubber plantation industry in Mexico . It is estimated that

during the next twelve months about a quarter of a million trees

budded to the improved clones of Hevea will be available at El Palmar.

The project has been notably successful to the present date and with a

rapidly expanding volume of valuable plant material it is necessary

to make definite plans for the best use of the plant material and of the

experience that has been gained , in order to further insure achieve-

Por este medio vengo ahora a reiterar formalmente a Vuestra

Excelencia que el Gobierno de Panamá asumirá la tercera parte de los gastos en que incurran los Estados Unidos en la medición y construcción del tramo de la Carretera Interamericana que vaya a

construírse dentro de los límites de la República de Panamá de acuerdo con lo establecido en la ya mencionada Ley Nº 375. Este

porcentaje ascendería a la suma de $2,200,000.00 aproximadamente de conformidad con lo que me ha expresado Vuestra Excelencia por medio del Memorandum Informal de esa Embajada , de 1º del presente mes de mayo .
Como en dicho Memorandum Informal se solicita indicación

acerca de la fuente específica de la cual han de provenir los fondos.

para el pago de esa tercera parte correspondiente a Panamá, informo

a Vuestra Excelencia que es el propósito de mi Gobierno obtener un empréstito interno con ese objeto .
En esta forma está presto el Gobierno de la República de Panamá

a aportar su concurso a la realización de esta obra de tanta trascendencia para la defensa y el futuro del Hemisferio .

MR. AMBASSADOR :

PANAMÁ, May 15, 1943.

It gives me pleasure to refer to this Ministry's aide-mémoire of March 3 , 1942 [ ] informing the Embassy that the Government of Panama desired to avail itself of the benefits of law 375 of the Congress of the United States on the construction of the Inter-American Highway and that it agreed to assume one third of the total cost of said work in the Panamanian section .
By this means I now reiterate formally to Your Excellency that the Government of Panama will assume one third of the expenses incurred by the United States in the survey and construction of the section of the Inter-American Highway to be constructed within the limits of the Republic of Panama in accordance with the provisions of the above-mentioned law 375. This percentage will amount to the sum of $2,200,000.00 approximately in accordance with what Your Excellency told me in the Embassy's informal memorandum of May 1. [']
Since in that informal memorandum an indication is requested regarding the specific source from which the funds will come for the payment of this one-third part corresponding to Panama , I inform Your Excellency that it is the plan of my Government to obtain an internal loan with this object in view.
In this form , the Government of the Republic of Panama is ready to contribute its share to the realization of this work of such importance to the defense and the future of the hemisphere .
Accept , Excellency , the reiterated assurances of my highest and most distinguished consideration .

I take pleasure in informing Your Excellency that the assurances offered in the kind note referred to are satisfactory to my Government . It is consequently the intention of my Government, as soon as Your Excellency's Government has completed the financial arrangements mentioned and subject to the appropriation of the necessary funds by the Congress of the United States, to extend to Your Excellency's Government the cooperation envisaged by the above-mentioned law . Your Excellency will recall that Public Law 375 provides that the surveying and construction work authorized by that act shall be under the administration of the Public Roads Administration. It is understood , therefore , that the pertinent Panamanian officials and the Public Roads Administration will seek to reach a subsidiary agreement regarding the administration of the contemplated work.
My Government is gratified that through this cooperative undertaking it will be possible to complete the Inter-American Highway to Panamá City . Transportation facilities will be improved , new lands and new natural resources developed , additional markets opened , and local economic conditions benefitted through the useful expenditure of money which this project envisages. Both of our countries should happily profit therefrom. I sincerely trust that the highway will serve not only as a link to increase material intercourse between our nations but also as another bond in the close friendship which unites us.
Accept, Excellency , the renewed assurances of my highest consideration .

I have the honour to refer to your note of September 3 , 1943 , regarding the agreement between Canada and the United States for

the waiver of claims arising as a result of collisions between Canadian and United States vessels of war.

You stated in your note that the Secretary of War has enquired whether "ships of the United States and Royal Canadian Armies, such as Army transports" are within the agreement .

EXCELLENCY :

I have the honor to refer to the request of Your Excellency's Government, through the Colombian Ambassador in Washington, for assistance in the execution of a cooperative program of public health and sanitation in Colombia and to the conversations of September 24 had between me, the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs, and the Minister of Trabajo , Higiene y Previsión Social , concerning such a program .
Reference is also made to the notes exchanged between the Government of Colombia and the Government of the United States on rubber

development in Colombia , with particular reference to a program of health and sanitation in connection with rubber production in Colombia.
My Government, through the Office of the Coordinator of InterAmerican Affairs, is prepared to send at once to Colombia, at the request of Your Excellency's Government, to cooperate with the corresponding officials of Your Excellency's Government and the Ministry of Trabajo , Higiene y Previsión Social , such experts as Your Excellency's Government desires in order to collaborate in developing a specific program for the improvement of health and sanitation conditions in Colombia . This program will be designed to improve health and sanitation conditions in Colombia in accordance with the memorandum prepared by the Minister of Trabajo , Higiene y Previsión Social and presented to me and to the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs in Bogotá on September 24 , 1942.
For the purposes of this program, the Government of the United States, through the agency of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs , will provide an amount not to exceed one million dollars (United States Currency) to be expended for the execution of the program . The expenditure of these funds may be applied not only to the health and sanitation program, but also , in the discretion of Your Excellency's Government, for such medical , scientific , and technical training as the Government of Colombia may wish undertaken by Colombian specialists.

57 STAT. ] COLOMBIA-HEALTH AND SANITATION PROGRAM-OCT. 23, 1942
It is understood that Your Excellency's Government will furnish such expert personnel , services, and funds for local expenditures as it may consider necessary for the efficient development of the program. The group of United States doctors and sanitary engineers which will be sent to Colombia by the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs shall be under the direction of the Chief Medical Officer of that Office, who in turn will be under the supervision of the appropriate officials of the Colombian Government. It is understood that a special service of public health and sanitation will be established within the Ministry of Trabajo , Higiene y Previsión Social under the direction of the Chief Medical Officer of the Coordinator's Office, and that detailed arrangements for the establishment of such a special service will be carried out between Brigadier General George C. Dunham, Director of the Health and Sanitation Division of the Coordinator's Office, and the Minister of Trabajo , Higiene y Previsión Social.
The expenditure of United States funds for the purposes of this program will be handled through the Institute of Inter-American Affairs, of which the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs is President and of which General George C. Dunham is Director of the Health and Sanitation Division . Detailed arrangements for the execution of each project will be discussed and agreed to between the Chief Medical Officer and the appropriate officer of Your Excellency's Government in the area of the proposed project .
It is understood that the Government of Colombia is particularly interested in including in the program projects aimed at continuing and extending measures and services which the public health and sanitation agencies of the Colombian Government have been carrying out with efficiency and success . The measures and services embodied in the health and sanitation program are included under the following headings :
1. The improvement of nutrition in a general program for the improvement of the public health of Colombia, utilizing the services already established by the Ministerio de Trabajo , Higiene y Previsión Social ;
2. Assistance in the control of malaria , with particular reference to the eradication of malaria in the ports of Barranquilla, Cartagena, Santa Marta, Buenaventura, Tumaco, and Bahía Solano ;
3. Assistance in the control and eradication of Rickettsiasis ; 4. Assistance in the control and eradication of Bartonellosis ; 5. Assistance in the sanitation of ports , particularly the ports of Barranquilla , Cartagena , Santa Marta, Buenaventura, Tumaco, and Bahía Solano , and such other areas as may be agreed upon ; 6. The establishment , in so far as practicable , of public health centers for the effective execution of this program ;

7. The training of Colombian personnel in the fields of medicine, public health , sanitary engineering, nursing, and hospital administration .
It is agreed that all projects completed in accordance with the present agreement will be the property of the Government of Colombia .
With reference to the foregoing , I am instructed to state that this agreement can in no way commit my Government to make available supplies and equipment which may be deemed necessary to implement the agreement . While my Government sympathizes with the objectives which Your Excellency's Government aims at in the health and sanitation program , Your Excellency's Government recognizes , I am sure, that the allocation of essential or critical equipment and materials to the program must be held in abeyance due to the very real shortages of many essential materials and the necessity for preserving them for important and essential war undertakings.
I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the assurances of my highest and most distinguished consideration .

Agreement between the United States of America and Brazil respecting mobilization of the productive resources of Brazil . Effected by exchange of notes signed at Washington March 3, 1942.
The Brazilian Minister of Finance to the Acting Secretary of State
EMBAIXADA DOS ESTADOS UNIDOS DO BRASIL Washington, em 3 de março de 1942.
SENHOR SECRETARIO DE ESTADO INTERINO , Na Resolução IIa da 3a . Reunião de Ministros das Relações
Exteriores das Republicas Americanas , no Rio de Janeiro , o Governo brasileiro se comprometeu a cooperar no mais alto grau com as demais Republicas Americanas na mobilização de seus recursos economicos com o especial objetivo de aumentar a produção de materiais estrategicos , essenciais à defesa do Hemisfério e à manutenção das economias do Brasil e das outras Republicas Americanas .
O Governo do Brasil, por intermédio da Missão Economica que tenho a honra de chefiar, propõe desde já tomar medidas para levar avante eficazmente êsse empreendimento e promover o programa de desenvolvimento da produção de tais materiais , que já vêm sendo explorados.
O Governo do Brasil julga que a maneira mais eficaz de realizar seus altos propositos será constituir uma nova organização oficial para investigar e promover o desenvolvimento de materiais estrategicos e outros recursos naturais do Brasil . A nova organização, que poderia ser um novo departamento do Govêrno brasileiro ou uma associação sob controle governamental examinaria todos os projetos susceptíveis de fomentar tal desenvolvimento e tornaria possível a realização dos projetos recomendados , quer por meio de emprezas já existentes no Brasil ou, na falta de entidades adequadas, por meio de novos departamentos, organizações independentes ou emprezas particulares a serem creadas para esse fim.
Em qualquer caso , porém, a nova organização funcionaria como uma dependência do Governo brasileiro , interessada não em fins lucrativos, mas, principalmente , em fomentar na medida do possível, o desenvolvimento dos recursos naturais do Brasil , afim de melhor atender os interêsses do país e das outras Republicas Americanas.
A nova organização brasileira teria o seu trabalho grandemente facilitado si pudesse contar , de um modo positivo , com a assistência técnica dos Estados Unidos . Ademais , para realizar o seu programa, o Governo brasileiro necessitaria, além de fundos para despezas locais , por êle fornecidos , de creditos em dolares , no valor total aproximado de $ 100.000.000 , a ser sacado a medida que fôsse necessário para cubrir as despezas em dolares feitas com os projetos adotados .

57 STAT. ] BRAZIL- MOBILIZATION OF RESOURCES- MAR. 3, 1942
Tais creditos seriam utilizados em projetos empreendidos diretamente pelo Govêrno brasileiro ou por particulares aprovados por êle .
Em nome do Governo brasileiro e de acordo com os entendimentos da Missão Economica Brasileira , que tenho a honra de chefiar, com os representantes do Govêrno dos Estados Unidos , muito agradeceria que o Governo de Vossa Excelência estudasse com simpatia o presente programa de cooperação técnica e financeira.
Tenho a firme convicção de que um programa de colaboração , como o que acima ficou delineado , poderá ser do maior valor para os nossos dois países , na objetivação dos propositos da Resolução da Reunião do Rio de Janeiro, de mobilizar todas as possibilidades economicas do Hemisfério na nossa defeza comúm .

Translation by the Department of State ofthe Foregoing Note
EMBASSY OF THE UNITED STATES OF BRAZIL Washington, March 3, 1942.
MR. ACTING SECRETARY OF STATE : In resolution II of the Third Meeting of the Ministers of Foreign
Affairs of the American Republics at Rio de Janeiro , the Brazilian Government undertook to cooperate to the utmost possible degree with the other American republics in the mobilization of its economic resources with the special objective of increasing the production of strategic materials essential to the defense of the hemisphere and to the maintenance of the economies of Brazil and the other American republics .
The Government of Brazil, through the Economic Mission which I have the honor to head, proposes at once to take measures to carry out that undertaking effectively and to further the program of developing the production of such materials, which are already being produced .
The Government of Brazil believes that the most effective way of carrying out its high purposes will be to create a new official organization to investigate and promote the development of strategic materials and other natural resources of Brazil . The new organization, which might be a new department of the Brazilian Government or a government-controlled corporation , would examine all feasible projects for promoting such a development and would make possible the realization of the projects recommended , either by means of existing enterprises in Brazil or, where suitable entities do not exist , by means of new departments, independent organizations, or private enterprises to be established for that purpose.

1315

1316

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [ 57 Stat.
In any case, however, the new organization would function as an agency of the Brazilian Government, not for profit, but primarily to promote to the fullest degree possible the development of Brazil's natural resources, in order best to serve the interests of the country and of the other American republics.
The work of the new Brazilian organization would be greatly facilitated if it could have positive assurance of technical assistance from the United States . Moreover, in order to carry out its program , the Brazilian Government, in addition to the funds for local expenditures, which it would provide, would require dollar credits in the approximate total amount of $ 100,000,000 , to be drawn against as needed for dollar expenditures in connection with the projects adopted .
Such credits would be utilized in projects undertaken directly by the Brazilian Government or by private individuals approved by it.
On behalf of the Government of Brazil, and in accordance with understandings between the Brazilian Economic Mission , which I have the honor to head , and the representatives of the Government of the United States, I should greatly appreciate it if Your Excellency's Government would study sympathetically the present program of technical and financial cooperation .
I am firmly convinced that a program of collaboration , such as that outlined above , can be of the greatest value for both of our countries in carrying out the aims of the resolution of the Rio de Janeiro Meeting to mobilize all the economic resources of the hemisphere in our common defense.
I avail myself of the opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the assurances of my highest consideration .

EXCELLENCY :

March 3, 1942

I acknowledge the receipt of your note of March 3, 1942 , outlining a program for further economic cooperation between the United States

and Brazil in furtherance of Resolution II of the Third Meeting of the

Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the American Republics at Rio de

Janeiro, calling for the mobilization of the productive resources of the American republics.

I have the honor to inform you that the appropriate agencies of the Government of the United States have considered carefully this program and are prepared to extend the financial and expert cooperation essential to its success. I have been informed by the Secretary of

57 STAT. ] BRAZIL- MOBILIZATION OF RESOURCES-MAR. 3, 1942
Commerce that he is agreeable to the opening of a line of credit of up to $ 100,000,000 for the purpose of financing dollar expenditures in connection with specific projects to be undertaken by the Brazilian Government through the agency of the proposed new organization . It is contemplated that such projects shall be undertaken after agreement between the Brazilian Government , acting through the new organization, and the Government of the United States , acting through the Department of Commerce, and that appropriate United States technical and expert assistance shall be made available as necessary and desirable. The Secretary of Commerce will consider and act upon such projects within the period in which the Export-Import Bank of Washington is in a position to provide these credits, and to the extent that its funds may be available for this purpose. Details of the arrangements may be worked out between representatives of the Government of Brazil and the Secretary of Commerce.
It is of course understood that although the United States is desirous of cooperating to the fullest extent in the general development of the Brazilian economy, the carrying out of specific projects which require important amounts of machinery, equipment or other materials produced in the United States must be conditioned upon careful investigation and determination that the particular project will contribute in an important manner to the progress of our war effort and to the security of the Hemisphere, and has accordingly been granted the appropriate priority ratings.
I believe that the cooperative program which the Governments of Brazil and the United States of America are undertaking will constitute a further great step forward in mutually beneficial economic relationships between our two countries and in the mobilization of the economic resources of the Western Hemisphere .
Accept, Excellency, the assurances of my most distinguished consideration .

EMBAIXADA DOS ESTADOS UNIDOS DO BRASIL ·
Washington, em 3 de Março de 1942.
SENHOR SECRETÁRIO DE ESTADO INTERINO , Tive a honra de trocar hoje com Vossa Excelência notas referentes
á criação de uma organização brasileira de expansão á qual será concedido um crédito de 100 milhões de dólares pelo Banco de Exportação e Importação . Esta organização brasileira foi estabelecida em consoante á Resolução II da Terceira Reunião Consultiva de Ministros das Relações Exteriores das Repúblicas Americanas realizada no Rio de Janeiro, em virtude da qual o Govêrno brasileiro resolveu colaborar com as mesmas Repúblicas no mais alto gráu possível para a mobilização dos seus recursos econômicos visando especialmente o aumento da produção dos materiais estratégicos essenciais á defesa do Hemisfério contra a agressão armada e á manutenção da economia do Brasil e de outras Repúblicas americanas .
Um dos projetos concretos a respeito do desenvolvimento dos recursos do Brasil que tem sido discutido entre o Governo de Vossa Excelência e a Missão Econômica Brasileira , que tenho a honra de chefiar, é o que se refere á expansão da produção de borracha no Vale do Amazonas e regiões adjacentes . Nossas discussões sobre tal assunto alcançaram agora o ponto em que acredito ser possível sugerir os seguintes itens para o citado projeto :
1º-A Rubber Reserve Company , afim de cooperar com o Governo brasileiro no desenvolvimento da borracha do Vale do Amazonas e regiões adjacentes , estabelecerá um fundo de cinco milhões de dólares destinado a aumentar a produção de borracha no citado Vale e regiões . É de se esperar que o dispêndio dessa soma resulte no aumento da exportação de borracha brasileira para os Estados Unidos da América, em volume anual não inferior a vinte e cinco mil toneladas.
2º O Banco do Brasil ou outro departamento ou agência do Governo brasileiro tornar-se-á o único e final comprador de borracha , tanto para a exportação quanto para o consumo doméstico , excepção feita da Rubber Reserve Company que, de acordo com o Banco do Brasil , poderá adquirir borracha por sua própria conta. O Governo brasileiro depois de reservar quantidades adequadas para suas necessidades internas estabelecerá quotas de exportação visando fornecer aos Estados Unidos da América a maior quantidade de borracha.

Washington , March 3, 1942 .
MR . ACTING SECRETARY OF STATE : I have had the honor to exchange notes with Your Excellency
today referring to the creation of a Brazilian development organization to which a credit of 100 million dollars will be extended by the Export-Import Bank. This Brazilian organization has been established in consonance with resolution II of the Third Consultative Meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the American Republics at Rio de Janeiro, in virtue of which the Brazilian Government resolved to collaborate with the said republics in the greatest possible degree for the mobilization of their economic resources with a view especially to increasing the production of strategic materials essential

to the defense of the hemisphere against armed aggression and to the maintenance of the economy of Brazil and of other American republics .
One of the concrete projects with respect to the development of the resources of Brazil which has been discussed between Your Excellency's Government and the Brazilian Economic Mission, which I have the honor to head, is the one relating to the increase of the production of rubber in the Amazon Valley and adjacent regions . Our discussions on this subject have now reached the stage where I believe it is possible to suggest the following points for the said project:
1. The Rubber Reserve Company, in order to cooperate with the Brazilian Government in the development of rubber in the Amazon Valley and adjacent regions , will establish a fund of five million dollars to be used to increase the production of rubber in the said valley and regions. It is to be hoped that the expenditure of this sum will result in the increase of exportation of Brazilian rubber to the United States of America , in an annual volume of not less than 25,000 tons.
2. The Bank of Brazil or other department or agency of the Brazilian Government will become the sole and final purchaser of rubber, both for exportation and for domestic consumption, with the exception of the Rubber Reserve Company which, in accord with the Bank of Brazil, will be able to purchase rubber for its own account . The Brazilian Government after reserving quantities adequate for its domestic needs will establish export quotas with a view to furnishing to the United States of America the greatest quantity of rubber.
3. The Rubber Reserve Company will make a five-year agreement with the Bank of Brazil or other department or agency of the Brazilian Government for the acquisition of rubber produced in Brazil .
4. The Rubber Reserve Company will cooperate with the Instituto Agronômico do Norte in the solution of the scientific problems of the development of rubber production in the Amazon Valley and adjacent regions .
5. The Brazilian Government will cooperate fully with the Government of the United States of America to increase the production of crude and manufactured rubber in Brazil .
6. In compliance with resolution XXX approved in the Consultative Meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the American Republics held at Rio de Janeiro, the Government of the United States of America will furnish the services of the Division of Health and Sanitation established by the Office of the Coordinator of InterAmerican Affairs for the development works of the Amazon Valley and adjacent regions , with the objective of carrying out there a program of improvement of sanitary conditions in collaboration with official agencies of other American republics.
In the name of the Brazilian Government and in accordance with the understandings which the Brazilian Economic Mission reached

The Acting Secretary of State to the Brazilian Minister for Finance
DEPARTMENT OF STATE WASHINGTON March 14, 1942
MY DEAR MR. MINISTER:
I refer to the notes which we exchanged on March 3 , 1942 on rubber development in the Amazon Valley , and specifically to Point 6 of your note concerning the readiness of this Government to lend its good offices through the Health and Sanitation Division of the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs in matters pertaining to health and sanitation conditions in the Amazon Valley . I refer also to the agreements reached on that day with respect to other economic projects .
The Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs is prepared to send at once to Brazil , on your request , to cooperate with corresponding officials of the Brazilian Government and its health services , such experts as your Government desires in order to collaborate in developing a specific health and sanitation program . The program would. be initially designed for the Amazon Basin area for the special purpose of aiding in the stimulation of rubber production, but at the desire of the Government of Brazil could be extended to other areas .
For these purposes this Government, through the agency of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs, will provide an amount not to exceed $5,000,000 to be expended toward the development of this health and sanitation program . The expenditure of these funds may be applied not only to health and sanitation projects but also , in the discretion of the Government of Brazil , for such medical or sanitation engineering training as the Government of Brazil may wish undertaken by Brazilian specialists.
It is understood that the Government of Brazil will furnish such
expert personnel, materials , services and funds for local expenditures as it may consider necessary for the efficient development of the program .
The group of United States medical and sanitation specialists which the Brazilian Government indicates should be sent by the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs shall be under the direction of the chief medical officer of that Office who in turn
will be under the supervision of the appropriate officials of the Brazilian Government.

57 STAT. ] BRAZIL -HEALTH AND SANITATION PROGRAM- MAR. 14, 1942
Detailed arrangements for the execution of each project shall be discussed and agreed to between the chief medical officer and the officer of the Brazilian Government in the area of the proposed project. The technical advice and expert assistance of United States medical and sanitation specialists will be made available to the appropriate Brazilian authorities at any time that the need for consultation arises .
I understand that the Government of Brazil would be particularly interested in including in the program projects aimed at continuing and expanding the measures and services which the health and sanitation agencies of the Government of Brazil have been carrying out with efficiency and success in the areas in question . These measures and services may be included under the following general headings :
1. Malaria control . 2. Yellow fever control . 3. General disease control by hospitals, clinics and public education. 4. Water supply systems . 5. Sewage systems . 6. Garbage and rubbish disposal . All projects completed in accordance with the present arrangement would of course be the property of the Government of Brazil . I am, my dear Dr. Souza Costa,
Sincerely yours, SUMNER WELLES
His Excellency Dr. ARTHUR DE SOUZA COSTA, Minister for Finance of Brazil.
The Brazilian Minister for Finance to the Acting Secretary of State
MARCH 14, 1942 MY DEAR MR. SECRETARY :
I refer to your letter of today's date in which you propose , on behalf of the Government of the United States, cooperation with the Government of Brazil to carry out the measures of health and sanitation considered desirable in connection with the program for rubber development agreed to in our exchange of notes of March 3 , 1942 , and in connection with the other economic projects agreed upon on that day.
I am happy to confirm that my Government has for many years been actively pursuing a health and sanitation program as outlined in your letter and that it is pleased to accept this offer of collaboration in order to stimulate the progress of the program which has so important a bearing on the economic possibilities of the areas in question . My Government will be ready to furnish expert personnel, materials,

I avail myself of the opportunity to present to Your Excellency the assurance of my highest consideration.

ment in expanding the program of public health and sanitation , thus

contributing the funds necessary for the execution of the program within a five-year period beginning January 1 , 1944 .

Next Your Excellency proposes that the Brazilian Government , which has already contributed the amount of CR $ 9.000.000,00 toward the cooperative program, shall contribute an additional amount of CR $ 100.000.000,00 to be expended in the said five-year period together with the funds furnished by the United States of America for the same purpose .

of the Brazilian Government, who would be the Minister of Education and Health , and an authorized member of the Institute of Inter-

"9. Mexican workers shall be afforded opportunity to work the same number of working hours per week as other workers engaged in similar employment at the place of employment. In view of the fact that in accordance with custom in the United States no subsistence allowances are furnished to non-agricultural workers, Mexican workers are guaranteed under this agreement a minimum of 75 % of full time employment in each pay period and at least 90% of full time employment during period for which contracted . However, if the worker is afforded an opportunity to work but is unwilling or unable to work the guarantee in the previous sentence shall not apply.
"10. The term of the contract shall be agreed upon by the representatives of the two Governments with privilege of extension with the consent of the worker and approval of the Mexican Government .
"11.

"C. Savings Fund "The War Manpower Commission assumes responsi-
bility for the safekeeping of amounts contributed by Mexican workers for the formation of the Savings Fund until such amounts are credited to the Bank of Mexico in such agency or agencies of said bank in the United States and which agencies will be determined by means of an exchange of notes. The Bank of Mexico for its part will transfer the sums in question to the Banco del Ahorro Nacional, S.A.

"Whenever the War Manpower Commission shall have made the deposits referred to in the previous paragraph it shall send directly to the Banco del Ahorro Nacional, S.A. a list containing the names of the beneficiaries and the amount corresponding to each of them for the abovementioned fund.
"GENERAL PROVISIONS "It is understood that the War Manpower Commission will

Either Government shall have the right to renounce this understanding giving appropriate notification to the other Government ninety days in advance.

I desire to express my gratitude to Your Excellency for the manner in which the negotiations leading up to this agreement were conducted . The Mexican representatives have at all times had a real comprehension of the urgency and necessity for these workers in the United States . On the other hand, the United States representatives recognize the full value of this contribution of Mexico to the joint war effort.

México, 29 de abril de 1943.

SEÑOR EMBAJADOR:

En su muy atenta nota número 1218 , del 29 del actual, que para mayor precisión a continuación inserto , Vuestra Excelencia me dice lo siguiente :

57 STAT. ] MEXICO- NON-AGRICULTURAL WORKERS-APR. 29, 1943
"Tengo la honra de referirme a mi nota número 990 , del 29 de enero de 1943 , en la cual pregunté a Vuestra Excelencia si su Gobierno estaría dispuesto a concluir un arreglo mediante el cual trabajadores no especializados podrían ser contratados en México para trabajos no agrícolas en los Estados Unidos, así como a la contestación de Vuestra Excelencia del 3 de febrero de 1943. -La posibilidad de contratar trabajadores no agrícolas fué también prevista cuando se celebró el acuerdo para los trabajadores agrícolas del 4 de agosto de 1942 y el siguiente párrafo constituye parte de dicho arreglo : " "Queda sobreentendido que al tratarse de la salida de otros trabajadores mexicanos , no agrícolas, prevalecen en los arreglos que lleven a cabo las dependencias de los respectivos Gobiernos , los mismos principios fundamentales que se han aplicado aquí a la salida de trabajadores del campo" " -Los representantes debidamente autorizados del Gobierno de los Estados Unidos , junto con los representantes autorizados del Gobierno de México , han llegado al siguiente acuerdo respecto a los trabajadores no agrícolas :
"A fin de que pueda disponerse de trabajadores mexicanos para su empleo en trabajos no agrícolas en los Estados Unidos y , al propio tiempo , para asegurar que tales trabajadores sean protegidos convenientemente mientras permanezcan fuera de México , se sugieren las disposiciones siguientes para su aprobación por los representantes de los Gobiernos de ambos países .
Estas disposiciones incluyen los mismos principios fundamentales que fueron aplicados a la partida de los trabajadores de campo , conforme al convenio celebrado entre la República Mexicana y los Estados Unidos de América , de fecha 4 de agosto de 1942 . I. PRINCIPIOS GENERALES
1. Los nacionales de México que entren a los Estados Unidos con contrato de un departamento o dependencia apropiada del Gobierno no estarán sujetos al servicio militar en los Estados Unidos .
2. De acuerdo con los principios enunciados en el Decreto del Ejecutivo No. 8802 , expedido en la Casa Blanca el 25 de junio de 1941 , los nacionales de México que penetren a los Estados Unidos como resultado de cualquier entendimiento entre los dos Gobiernos , no sufrirán actos discriminatorios de ninguna naturaleza .
3. Los nacionales mexicanos que entren a los Estados Unidos para ser empleados en ese país, conforme al presente convenio, disfrutarán de las garantías de transporte, gastos de subsistencia y de repatriación que establece el artículo 29 de la Ley Federal del Trabajo de México , que es del tenor siguiente :
"Artículo 29.- Todo contrato de trabajo celebrado por trabajadores mexicanos, para la prestación de servicios fuera del país , deberá extenderse por escrito , ser legalizado por la autoridad municipal del lugar donde se celebre y visado por el Cónsul de la Nación donde deberán prestarse los servicios . Contendrá, además, como necesarios para su validez, las siguientes estipulaciones sin las cuales no podrá ser legalizado :

1359

1360

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [57 STAT.
I. Los gastos de transporte y alimentación del trabajador y de sus familiares , en su caso, y todos los que se originasen por el paso de las fronteras y cumplimiento de las disposiciones sobre migración o cualquier otro concepto semejante , serán por cuenta exclusiva del patrón o contratista ;
II. El trabajador percibirá íntegro el salario convenido , sin que pueda descontársele cantidad alguna por cualesquiera de los conceptos a que se refiere el inciso anterior, y
III.-El empresario o contratista otorgará fianza y constituirá depósito en efectivo en el Banco del Trabajo , y , en su defecto , en el Banco de México , a entera satisfacción de la autoridad de trabajo respectiva, por una cantidad igual a al que importen todos los gastos de repatriación del trabajador y su familia, y los de su translado hasta el lugar de origen . Una vez que el empresario compruebe haber cubierto dichos gastos o la negativa del trabajador para volver al país , y que no adeuda al trabajador cantidad alguna por concepto de salario o indemnización a que tuviere derecho , la autoridad de trabajo ordenará la devolución del depósito o cancelará la fianza otorgada".
Queda específicamente entendido que las disposiciones del inciso III, del artículo 29 arriba citado , no se aplicarán, por lo que hace a los Gobiernos de los Estados Unidos y México, a pesar de la inclusión del aludido inciso en el presente convenio, en vista de la obligación asumida por el Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de acuerdo con la sección III , párrafo A, parte 1 de este mismo convenio .
4. Los mexicanos que entren a los Estados Unidos conforme a este convenio no serán empleados para desplazar a otros trabajadores ni con el objeto de abatir salarios ni otras normas previamente establecidos.

2. El Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de América , por conducto del Presidente de la Comisión de Mano de Obra para la Guerra (War Manpower Commission) o de su representante autorizado , celebrará contratos con los empleadores en los Estados Unidos encargados de emplear a los trabajadores ; los contratos estarán en armonía con los principios en que hubieren convenido los dos Gobiernos .
3. En adelante , cuando se use en el presente texto el término empleador se entenderá que significa el propietario o patrón de una empresa no agrícola en los Estados Unidos , por quien será

Esto no disminuye el alcance de las obligaciones asumidas por el Gobierno de los Estados Unidos conforme a los párrafos 1 y 2 anteriores . B. Salarios y Trabajo. 1.

February 24, 1942.

I refer to point 4 of the memorandum of January 29, 1942 [1 ] which was delivered to the Government of Ecuador by the Government of the United States at Rio de Janeiro, committing my Government to assist the Government of Ecuador in an amount not to exceed $2,000,000 to be expended in ways which will contribute to the attainment of the

objectives of that Government in matters of health and sanitation. In fulfilment of this commitment and in accordance with Resolution

XXX of the Third Meeting of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the American Republics at Rio de Janeiro, the Government of the United States, acting through the agency of the Coordinator of InterAmerican Affairs, is sending, upon your request, a small group of experts to Ecuador in the immediate future in order to develop a specific program in agreement with the Government of Ecuador, acting through the agency of the Municipality of Quito and the Junta de Beneficencia of Guayaquil. This group will be under the immediate direction of the Chief Medical Officer of the Office of the Coordinator

of Inter-American Affairs and will work in the closest cooperation

with the appropriate Ecuadoran officials. Approval for the actual execution of the specific projects agreed upon will be made by the respective Governments or their duly appointed agents upon recommendation of the Chief Medical Officer, acting in cooperation with the appropriate officials of the Municipality of Quito or the Junta de Beneficencia of Guayaquil, or with appropriate officials designated by the Ecuadoran Government for such projects as might be undertaken outside of the municipal areas of Quito and Guayaquil . Expenditures for such projects shall be made upon certification of the Chief Medical Officer and the appropriate Ecuadoran official designated for the areas where projects will be executed.
The specific projects of interest to the Ecuadoran Government include :

1. For Quito : 1. Improvement of the sewage system.

ment will be prepared to facilitate such training of Ecuadoran personnel as the two Governments may deem advisable.

SIR :
During the course of a conversation on April 24 , 1942 , Mr. Keenleyside, Assistant Under Secretary of State for External Affairs , raised the question of the southern terminus of the Alaska Highway now under construction, and inquired in particular if my Government felt that the stretch of road between railhead at Dawson Creek and Fort St. John fell within the terms of the American offer as contained in my note of March 17, 1942.
The wording of the pertinent recommendation of the Permanent Joint Board on Defense, which was incorporated in my note of March 17th , dealt with "the construction of a highway along the route that follows the general line of airports, Fort St. John - Fort Nelson Watson Lake - Whitehorse - Boundary - Big Delta , the respective termini connecting with existing roads in Canada and Alaska" .
As there seemed from Mr. Keenleyside's query to be some ambiguity as to whether the word "termini " limited the length of the road to be constructed, or merely described where existing roads, irrespective of their size or carrying capacity, ended , the appropriate minutes of the Permanent Joint Board on Defense were consulted . These contain the following sentence :

56 Stat. 1458.

"The proposed highway would have its southern terminus on the Edmonton, Dunvegan, British Columbian Railway, which has available carrying capacity substantially in excess of the possible carrying capacity of the road . Its northern terminus would be at a point about sixty miles south of Fairbanks on the Richardson Highway, which connects Fairbanks with Valdes ."

In view of the foregoing, which clarifies the intent of the Permanent Joint Board on Defense, my Government believes that its offer to undertake the building and wartime maintenance of the highway does in fact include the stretch of road from Dawson Creek to Fort St. John.

LEGATION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Ottawa, Canada, August 26, 1942.

SIR : With a view to increasing the value of the Alaska Highway , the
American authorities are anxious to undertake the construction of eight flight strips to be located along the road. The tentative sites for these strips are as follows :

No. 1 At Dawson Creek. No. 2 About 50 miles south of Ft . Nelson, No. 3 About 75 miles west of Ft. Nelson. No. 4 Approximately 40 miles east of Lower Post. No. 5 Approximately 55 miles west of Lower Post. No. 6 Approximately 60 miles southeast of Whitehorse. No. 7 Approximately 30 miles northwest of Whitehorse. No. 8 About midway between Burwash Landing and Snag.

Although the flight strips will in all cases be located along the highway, they will be so placed in direction as to benefit by the prevailing wind . '
My Government believes that the construction of these eight flight strips along the highway, which will result in its greater usefulness , falls within the scope and under the terms of the project as agreed to in our exchange of notes of March 17-18, 1942 , but inasmuch as mention thereof was not specifically made in the text, it would welcome a confirmation from you of its belief.

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Ottawa, November 28, 1942.

SIR :

I have the honor to refer to my conversation with Mr. Keenleyside of November 11 , 1942 , in which , on behalf of the Government of the United States of America , I requested the approval of the Canadian Government for the construction by appropriate American agencies of the Canadian section of a road from Haines Point, Alaska, to

Champagne, Yukon Territory, where it would join the Alaska ( Alcan ) Highway which is now being constructed according to agreement between our two Governments.

As I pointed out, the construction of this cut-off road would give the United States Army additional facilities for distributing supplies in Yukon and Alaska by truck, and would materially supplement the quantity of freight that can now be moved into the Whitehorse area

over the narrow gauge White Pass and Yukon Railway. The Canadian Government was good enough to inform me orally
on November 19 , 1942, that it authorized the construction of that part of the Haines - Champagne road which lies in Canada and I have been directed to express the appreciation of the United States Government for this new mark of Canadian cooperation.
My Government has now instructed me to propose to the Canadian

Government that the Haines- Champagne cut-off road shall hence-

forth be considered an integral part of the Alcan Highway, subject in all applicable respects to the terms of the agreement reached in our exchange of notes of March 17-18 , 1942.

SIR , I have the honour to refer to the suggestions made by the Legation
some years ago, and renewed in the Legation's Memorandum of De-

cember 4, 1941 , [ ¹ ] regarding the granting of the privilege of free import after first arrival to several categories of United States officials in Canada who do not at present receive it.
2. After careful consideration, the Canadian Government has decided that it would be willing to grant this privilege to Consuls and Vice Consuls of career but not to any other United States officials in Canada who do not at present receive it. The Canadian Government's proposal is, of course, conditional on reciprocity. In view of the fact that Canada does not have any Consuls or Vice Consuls in the United States, and is not likely to have a large number of them for many years, it is desired that the privilege of free import after first arrival be given to Canadian Trade Commissioners and Assistant Trade Commissioners in the United States, as well as to Canadian Consuls and Vice Consuls of career, if and when any should be appointed.
3. The Canadian Government has also had under consideration an-

other aspect of the Customs Regulations, namely, the right of free entry on first arrival for United States Government employees who are not expressly given that privilege by the Regulations under Tariff Item 706 e. g. clerks of the United States Legation and of Consulates , officers and employees of the United States Customs offices, etc. In

practice such persons are given free entry on first arrival by entering them as "Settlers". I understand that in the United States a similar

procedure is used to grant free entry on first arrival to non-diplomatic employees of the Canadian Government.
4. We propose that the privilege of free entry on first arrival should be expressly extended to all employees ( of United States nationality)

of the United States Government sent to posts in Canada and to all employees ( of Canadian nationality ) of the Canadian Government sent to posts in the United States. This free entry on first arrival should cover private automobiles , but not spirituous liquors.

If they are, I should like to know whether your Government desires to have a formal exchange of notes suitable for publication , or whether this Note and your reply will be sufficient .

Memorandum of agreement between the United States of America , Argentina, Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom respecting wheat. Initialed at Washington April 22, 1942 ; effective June 27, 1942. And related papers.

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT

Washington Wheat Meeting.

1. Officials of Argentina , Australia , Canada and the United States,

wheat exporting countries, and of the United Kingdom , a wheat

importing country, met in Washington on July 10, 1941 to resume

the wheat discussions which were interrupted in London by the out-

break of war in September 1939 and to consider what steps might be

taken toward a solution of the international wheat problem.

2. The discussions at Washington, which extended over a period of many months, have made it clear that a satisfactory solution of

the problem requires an international wheat agreement and that such

an agreement requires a conference of the nations willing to participate which have a substantial interest in international trade in wheat.

Draft Convention. Post, p. 1384.

It was also recognized that pending the holding of such a conference the situation should not be allowed to deteriorate. The Washington Wheat Meeting has recorded the results of its deliberations in the attached Draft Convention in order to facilitate further international

consideration of the subject at such time as may be possible and to

provide a basis for such interim measures as may be found necessary.

consultation with other countries it deems the time propitious, should

convene a wheat conference of the nations having a substantial interest in international trade in wheat which are willing to participate , and that the Draft Convention above mentioned should be submitted

Those arrangements will come into effect on such date as may be unanimously agreed . Announcement of that date will be made within six months after the cessation of hostilities.

the other exporting countries and will be adjusted from time to time to meet substantial changes in freight and exchange rates.

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [57 STAT. DRAFT CONVENTION PREAMBLE

Accumulation of wheat surpluses.

1. The prospects with regard to the production and marketing of

wheat are such that accumulation of wheat surpluses threatens to

result in grave post- war difficulties for the economies of the producing

countries and hence, because of the interdependence of nations, for

the economies of all countries. It is also to be expected that , unless

appropriate action is taken , such accumulation will recur .

2. A solution of the problem thus presented must be regarded as an

essential part of any program of world economic reconstruction and

will call for cooperative action by all countries concerned in international trade in wheat. It will involve national and international

measures for the regulation of wheat production in both exporting and importing countries, for the orderly distribution of wheat and

flour in domestic and international trade at such prices as are fair to

consumers and provide a reasonable remuneration to producers and

for the maintenance of world supplies which shall be at all times ample

for the needs of consumers without being so excessive as to create

a world burden of unwanted surpluses.

Relief in war-stricken areas.

3. Cooperative action is also necessary to meet the need for relief

in the war -stricken areas of the world by the supply and distribution

of gifts of wheat .
Measures necessary to assure benefits of 4. The benefits of abundant world supplies of wheat cannot be abundant supplies. assured to consumers unless there is a substantial decrease in uneco-

nomic incentives to high-cost production , a lowering of barriers to world trade and the charging of prices to consumers not substantially higher than the price of wheat in international trade.

5. In many countries the standard of living would be improved by increasing the consumption of wheat through a lowering of prices. In all countries the standard of living would be improved by stimulating the consumption of foods rich in vitamins, proteins and minerals. The increased production of such foods would offer a more valuable use for land which has at times been used uneconomically

for high-cost production of wheat.

Agreement.

6. Producers of an international commodity such as wheat are directly affected by standards of living throughout the world, by international purchasing power and by prevailing policies and practices affecting international trade generally. There can be no basic solution of the problem of export surpluses without a general reduction of import barriers and no measure should be taken or maintained. which has the effect of retarding such reduction or of preventing in any way the fullest possible development of international trade.
Accordingly the contracting Governments have agreed as follows :

ARTICLE I ( EXPANSION OF TRADE )

1. The contracting Governments agree that an essential element of a solution of the world wheat problem is that consumers should

57 STAT.]

MULTILATERAL WHEAT-APR. 22, 1942

1385

have the opportunity and means of increasing their purchases of wheat from areas which are equipped to produce it economically.

They agree that such opportunity and means depend not only on the lowering of barriers to the importation of wheat but also on making available to wheat importing countries increased outlets for the exportation of goods which they in turn are equipped to produce

economically. They agree that this requires the adoption and pur-

suit of national and international policies aimed at a fuller and more

efficient use among nations of human and natural resources and

thereby a world- wide expansion of purchasing power. 2. Recognizing therefore that much that is called for transcends

the scope of a wheat agreement and requires action on a broad inter-

national basis, but that much also can be accomplished by national measures and by agreements with each other and with other coun-

tries, the contracting Governments undertake to further in every

way possible the attainment of the foregoing objectives. 3. The Council shall from time to time submit to the contracting
Governments a review of international trade in wheat and invite

them to consider, in the light of the foregoing, what measures may be adopted for the expansion of such trade.

ARTICLE II ( PRODUCTION CONTROL) *

1. The Governments of Argentina , Australia, Canada and the

United States of America shall adopt suitable measures to ensure

that the production of wheat in their territories does not exceed the

quantity needed for domestic requirements and the basic export

quotas and maximum reserve stocks for which provision is hereinafter made.
2. Should nevertheless production in any country be found to have

exceeded in any crop -year the quantity above prescribed , the Government of that country shall before the end of that crop-year take such action as will result in the disappearance of the excess production

within its territories before the end of the following crop-year or

shall otherwise deal with such excess production as the Council may direct, except that if any part of the excess production is shown to the satisfaction of the Council to be due to a yield above the average

of the preceding 20 years the Government of the country concerned may carry that part as provided in paragraph 3 ( a ) of Article III or deal with it in such other manner as may be agreed with the Council.
3. Pending the coming into force of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article, the Governments of Argentina, Australia , Canada and the United States of America shall adopt or maintain positive measures

EXCELLENCY :

EMBASSY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
Lima, May 19, 1943

I have the honor to refer to Your Excellency's Note No. 402 of May 14, 1943 [ ¹ ] transmitting for my consideration the revised draft of the Spanish text of the agreement for the establishment of the Inter-

American Cooperative Food Production Service, and to inform Your Excellency that except for two minor changes in wording I concur in Your Excellency's opinion that this Spanish text is satisfactory.
These two minor changes, which have been informally discussed with Mr. Moravsky, the Director of Agriculture, are :

1. Page 3, Clause Six, line 11 of the Spanish draft, to be altered to read in English as follows : "but, without prejudice to the immediately preceding provisions of this sentence , the necessary steps will so far as possible be taken to obtain those"
2. Page 3, Clause Nine, next to last line, the insertion after the words "labores oficiales", of the following new sentence which in English reads : "The members of the Food Production Mission of the Institute of Inter-American Affairs will not pay to Peru any direct tax on salaries when they are subject to such a tax by the United States of America".

In view of Mr. Moravsky's verbal statement that the above two

minor changes are acceptable, I have pleasure in transmitting as an

enclosure to this Note an original and one copy of the English text of this Memorandum of Agreement. Providing you perceive no

As I pointed out, this supplementary project would involve the transportation in tank cars of gasoline destined for the use of the United States Army in Alaska to Prince Rupert, where authority was requested for the American Government to build by contract suitable storage and loading facilities, and thence by barge to Skagway, Alaska. From Skagway to Whitehorse a four-inch pipeline would be laid under contracts let by the American Government, and the authority of the Canadian Government was requested to lay that section of the pipeline within Canadian territory. At Whitehorse the gasoline would be stored in the facilities being built under the Canol project.
The Canadian Government was good enough to inform me orally on June 27 that it approved the establishment of the new supply line as outlined in the preceding paragraph.
My Government has instructed me to propose to the Canadian Government that the terms of the agreement reached in the exchange Ante, pp . 1413, 1415. of notes of June 27-June 29, 1942, on the Canol project shall apply

also, mutatis mutandis, to the supplementary project outlined above in respect of any construction within Canadian territory except as hereafter set forth . My Government proposes that the pipeline from Skagway to Whitehorse and the storage and loading facilities at Prince Rupert shall remain its property and shall be operated under contracts with it or by its agents or representatives during the war. It further proposes that at the termination of the hostilities the two

governments agree that at the request of either government discussions between them shall be undertaken with a view to reaching an agreement in regard to the disposition of this pipeline and of the

57 STAT. ] CANADA- CANOL PROJECT PIPELINE-AUG. 14, 15, 1942
storage and loading facilities at Prince Rupert. Additionally, it is proposed that both governments agree that they will not themselves order or allow the dismantlement of this pipeline or of the facilities mentioned, nor will they allow their dismantlement by any company which may purchase them unless and until approval for dismantlement is recommended by the Permanent Joint Board on Defence.

The American Minister to the Canadian Secretary of State for External Affairs

LEGATION OF THE

No. 818

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Ottawa, Canada, December 28 , 1942.

SIR :

I have the honor to refer to our exchange of notes of June 27 and

Ante, pp. 1413, 1415.

June 29 , 1942 , regarding the desire of the United States Government to take steps for extending the fuel supply for the U. S. Army in Canada and Alaska. At that time the United States Government pro-

posed, and the Canadian Government approved , the so-called Canol

Project which included , inter alia, the drilling of wells in the vicinity

of Norman Wells, and the laying of a pipeline from Norman Wells to Whitehorse, capable of delivering 3,000 barrels of oil daily.

The developments of our joint war effort have in the opinion of my Government made it vitally necessary to discover additional sources of petroleum in northwestern Canada and Alaska , capable of produc-

ing from 15,000 to 20,000 barrels per day, to supplement the supply which will be obtained from Norman Wells. This will require the drilling of exploratory, or in oil parlance "wildcat" wells in this

northern region . As such operations should be conducted in a number of widely separated locations in the Northwest Territories, where

oil is believed to exist, it is suggested that the area in Canada within which such operations are authorized be bounded on the north by the

Arctic Ocean, on the east by the 112th meridian, on the south by the 60th parallel , on the west by the Continental Divide and the AlaskaCanadian Border.

The operations under immediate contemplation, - as a result of

which, however, it may prove desirable to enlarge or expand the Canol

Project - are for the sole purpose of discovering oil fields capable of producing the required 20,000 barrels per day . No plans have as yet been worked out covering the refineries, storage or distribution systems

beyond those already authorized and approved by the Canadian Government.

In view of all the circumstances involved, and the increasingly

urgent need of additional fuel for military purposes in the far north, the Government of the United States of America hopes that the

Canadian Government will approve these exploratory operations with

the understanding that the United States Army authorities be allowed

57 STAT. ] CANADA- CANOL PROJECT WELLS- Dec. 28, 1942 Jan. 13, 1943

during the war to drill through contract with one or more companies

either Canadian or American, to develop through contract with one or

more Canadian companies, and to make use of any petroleum sources

that may be discovered , subject to Canadian regulations governing

such operations and to the further understanding that operations

would be subject to the provisions of our exchange of notes of June 27 and June 29 above referred to, insofar as such provisions are not

inconsistent with the provisions of this note and are capable, with necessary adaptations and modifications, of being applied to such

operations. My Government will of course keep the Canadian Gov-

ernment fully informed of any future plans for carrying out these

operations.

DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS

OTTAWA, January 18, 1943. DEAR MR. MOFFAT :
I wish to refer again to your note of December 28, 1942 , No. 818 on the proposals for drilling exploratory oil wells in the Northwest Territories. The question has arisen as to the best means of avoiding the possibility of the intervention of any one whose interest is not identical with that of the Canadian Government or of the United States Government, and who might make application for oil and gas rights in that part of the Northwest Territories under discussion.
It would facilitate the drafting of regulations if the United States authorities would indicate more definitely the particular districts, within the very large area described in your note No. 818, paragraph 2, which seem to be the most promising. These districts could then be reserved for exploration by nominees of the United States Government.
Yours sincerely, H. L. KEENLEYSIDE.
Assistant Under Secretary of State for External Affairs.
The Honourable PIERREPONT MOFFAT, United States Minister to Canada, Ottawa.

The American Chargé d'Affaires ad interim to the Canadian Assistant Under Secretary of State for External Affairs

DEAR MR. KEENLEYSIDE :

LEGATION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
Ottawa, February 17, 1943.

I sent to the State Department for its comments the text of your letter to Mr. Moffat of January 18, 1943, regarding a more strict delimitation of the districts in which wildcatting would be done in the Northwest Territories in order that such districts might be reserved for exploration by nominees of the United States Government.

Jan. 18, Feb. 17, 1943 57 STAT. ] CANADA- CANOL PROJECT AREAS-- Mar. 13, 1943

I have now received a reply to the effect that , while we are wholly in accord with your suggestion , it is nevertheless believed to be desirable that in any regulations which may be adopted there be nothing which would forbid operations anywhere within the broad general area mentioned in our note of December 28, 1942. I quote below, for your information , the pertinent parts of a letter of February 6, 1943 , to the Secretary of State from the Secretary of War on this subject :

"This office is wholly in accord with the suggestion contained in Dr. Keenleyside's letter of January 18, 1943 that certain areas should be reserved for exploration by nominees of the United States in order to prevent the possible intervention of any one whose interest is not identical with that of the Canadian Government or of the United States Government.
"At the present time it is expected that the greater part of the wildcatting will be carried on in the district contiguous to the Mackenzie River, approximately 25 miles each side thereof , and extending from Fort Wrigley on the south to Good Hope on the north. It is hoped that sufficient sources of oil to fulfill our requirements will be discovered within this area. However, there are under consideration and surveys are being made of two major districts which, on the basis of presently available geological data , are considered to be the most promising for oil exploration . These areas are defined as follows :

a. District of Mackenzie - An area contiguous to the Mackenzie River, approximately 75 miles each side thereof, and extending from Great Slave Lake on the south to the Arctic Ocean on the north .

b. Yukon Territory - All that portion of the Yukon Territory lying north of the 66th parallel .

"It is believed that, in accordance with the suggestion of the

Canadian authorities, it would be advantageous to both governments

to have the two major areas as described above reserved for oil ex-

ploration by the United States in connection with the Canol Project, to the exclusion of other interests.
6'6Although it is expected that our activities will be confined within

these two areas it would be considered inadvisable to have them strictly limited thereto. It is therefore the desire of this department that any regulations which may be adopted be of such a nature as to permit

operations anywhere within the broad general area described in our letter of November 18 , 1942 . " [ ¹]

DEAR MR. CLARK,

OTTAWA, March 13, 1943.

With reference to your letter of February 17th, on the matter of a more strict delimitation of the districts in the Northwest Territories

in which wildcatting rights might be reserved for nominees of the

United States Government, I have now received a reply from the Department of Mines and Resources on the subject .

The two areas mentioned in your letter are contiguous , namely :

1. District of Mackenzie - An area contiguous to the Mackenzie River, approximately 75 miles each side thereof, and extending from Fort Providence on the south to the Arctic Ocean on the north . Within the delta of the Mackenzie River , the line of reference shall be the East Channel.

2. Yukon Territory - All that portion of the Yukon Territory lying north of the 66th parallel .

It is proposed to apply the same regulations in these two areas as were worked out for the three areas already reserved by Orders- inCouncil P.C. 1138 dated 12th February 1943 , and P. C. 4140 of May

18th, 1942 , as a result of consultation between Mr. Sidney Paige, Consulting Geologist attached to the office of Colonel Wyman , and Dr. Camsell. These regulations were published in the Canada Gazette on February 20th, 1943, and provide :
First, (clause 1 ) that no one can prospect without first obtaining permission ;
Second, ( clause 14 ) that the Minister should have the right to refuse to issue a permit when , in his opinion it might retard the search for and the development of the oil resources or interfere with

the production of petroleum for the use of His Majesty or of any country associated or allied with His Majesty in the conduct of the present war.

This should afford ample protection against nuisance staking and

ensure that any exploratory and development work that may be car-
ried on by bona fide companies other than those nominated by the United States Government will be made available for our war needs.

I trust that this arrangement will be satisfactory to all parties.

Yours sincerely ,

OTTAWA, February 22, 1943.

SIR, I have the honour to refer to the correspondence and negotiations
with regard to the White Pass and Yukon Route. I am enclosing for your information a copy of an Order in Council P. C. 10067 , dated the 6th of November, 1942. This Order in Council is in terms which have already met with your approval, and which establish the legal foundation for the operation and maintenance by the Government of the United States of America for the duration of the war of the Railway owned by the British Yukon Railway Company and the British Columbia - Yukon Railway, which form parts of the White Pass and Yukon Route.
2. The arrangements which have been agreed upon contemplate that there may be agreements concluded between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Canada , or the Government of the Province of British Columbia, in respect of matters within the jurisdiction of such governments. It is my understanding that the authorities of your Government who are interested in this matter considered that such agreements should be of a flexible character, and should be entered into by recording, from time to time, by Exchange of Notes, arrangements which concern the two Governments. It is likely that in the course of the operation of the White Pass and Yukon Route further matters will arise requiring modifications and changes, and that your Government and mine will co- operate in bringing these about. There are, however, certain understandings which have already met with the approval of the interested departments of the two Governments during the negotiations at the meeting which was held on October 16, 1942.
3. Accordingly, it is desirable to place on record the following understandings :

Post, p. 1425.

(1) The monthly rental is to be paid by the United States Government in United States Dollars, and insofar as United States taxation is concerned is to be net to the companies.
( 2 ) The Canadian Government will continue to charge against the Canadian companies, namely the British Columbia - Yu-

1424

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [ 57 STAT.
kon Railway Company and the British Yukon Railway Company in the usual manner all taxes other than taxation of operating income. For the term of the lease, corporation income taxes will be based upon income from rental only, and there will be no taxation of operating profits as such. Similarly, it is open to the Province of British Columbia to continue to charge against the British Columbia - Yukon Railway Company such taxes as it has heretofore imposed upon the company, without regard to the operation of the White Pass and Yukon Route by the United States Government. (3) Civilian personnel resident in Canada will pay taxes to the Canadian Government , even though they are actually employed by the United States Government. Civilian employees resident in United States territory and United States Army personnel will not, by reason of their employment on the White Pass and Yukon Route, be subject to Canadian taxation.
(4) Civilian personnel will be subject to local Workmen's Compensation and Unemployment Insurance laws and regulations in the same manner as if they were directly employed by the Canadian companies. This will apply only to civilian personnel residing in Canadian territory, and will have no application to United States Army personnel or civilian personnel resident in United States territory. United States authorities will supply the necessary information to the Workmen's Compensation and Unemployment Insurance authorities , but will not be required to make deductions at the source .
( 5) The United States Government will furnish by February 15 of each year full information with respect to remuneration paid to civilian personnel resident in Canada, but will not be required to make deductions at the source for taxation purposes.
(6) The annual operating report to the Board of Transport will be made in the joint names of the two Canadian companies. This report will show substantially the same information as it has heretofore, with the exceptions that operating statistics will be omitted, and that the only income shown in the reports will be the annual rental received from the United States
Government. If required by the Board, operating statistics will be furnished by the United States Military Railway Service . Accept, Sir, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration.

LEGATION OF THE

No. 827 SIR :

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Ottawa, January 27, 1943.

Under instructions from my Government, I have the honor to refer to conversations relating to the post- war disposition of various facilities being or to be constructed in Canada by the Government of the United States.

Although in many instances the Governments of the United States of America and of Canada have reached specific agreements covering

the post-war disposition of defense projects and installations which, in order more effectively to prosecute the war, the Government of the United States, with the consent and approval of the Canadian Government, has built or is building in Canada, nevertheless there seemed advantage in defining certain general principles which in the absence of special circumstances should serve as a guide to the two Govern-

ments in formulating any future agreements covering the post- war disposition of such projects or installations in Canada . The same general principles would of course apply reciprocally in the event of any project or installation being built by the Canadian Government in the United States territory.
The matter was referred to the Permanent Joint Board on Defense
which after careful study adopted the following Recommendation on January 13, 1943.

Recommendation
adopted by Permanent Joint Board on Defense.

"The Board considered the question of the post-war disposition of the defense projects and installations which the Government of the United States has built or may build in Canada. The Board noted that the two Governments have already reached specific agreements for the post-war disposition of most of the projects and installations thus far undertaken. It considers that such agreements are desirable and should be made whenever possible.
"The Board recommends the approval of the following formula as a generally fair and equitable basis to be used by reference whenever appropriate in the making of agreements in the future and to cover such defense projects, if any, the post -war disposition

of which has not previously been specifically provided for :

81077°-44- PT. II-- 50

1430

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [ 57 STAT.

"A: All immovable defense installations built or provided in Canada by the Government of the United States shall within one year after the cessation of hostilities, unless otherwise agreed by the two Governments, be relinquished to the Crown either in the right of Canada or in the right of the province in which the same or any part thereof lies, as may be appropriate under Canadian law.

"B : All movable facilities built or provided in Canada by the Government of the United States shall within one year after the cessation of hostilities, unless otherwise agreed by the two Governments, at the option of the United States Government :

(1) be removed from Canada ; or

(2) be offered for sale to the Government of Canada , or with the approval of the Government of Canada , to the Government of the appropriate Province at a price to be fixed by a Board of two appraisers, one to be chosen by each country and with power to select a third in the case of disagreement.
"C: In the event that the United States Government has fore-

gone its option as described in B ( 1 ) , and the Canadian Government or the Provincial Government decides to forego its option
as described in B ( 2 ) , the facility under consideration shall be offered for sale in the open market, any sale to be subject to the approval of both Governments.
"D: In the event of no sale being concluded the disposition of such facility shall be referred for recommendation to the Permanent Joint Board on Defense or to such other agency as the two Governments may designate.
"The principles outlined above shall reciprocally apply to any defense projects and installations which may be built in the United States by the Government of Canada.
"All of the foregoing provisions relate to the physical disposition and ownership of projects, installations, and facilities and are without prejudice to any agreement or agreements which may be reached between the Governments of the United States and Canada in regard to the post-war use of any of these projects , installations, and facilities."

I have today been directed to inform you that this Recommendation has been approved by the Government of the United States of America, which would welcome confirmation from you that it has likewise been approved by the Government of Canada.

SIR : I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your note of January

It is noted with satisfaction that the Government of the United

States has approved the Twenty- Eighth Recommendation of the Permanent Joint Board on Defence which dealt with this matter and which read as follows :

"The Board considered the question of the post-war disposition of the defense projects and installations which the Government of the United States has built or may build in Canada. The Board noted that the two Governments have already reached specific agreements for the post -war disposition of most of the projects and installations thus far undertaken. It considers that such agreements are desirable and should be made whenever possible.
"The Board recommends the approval of the following formula as a generally fair and equitable basis to be used by reference whenever appropriate in the making of agreements in the future and to cover such defense projects, if any, the post-war disposition of which has not previously been specifically provided for :

"A : All immovable defense installations built or provided in Canada by the Government of the United States shall within one year after the cessation of hostilities, unless otherwise. agreed by the two Governments, be relinquished to the Crown. either in the right of Canada or in the right of the province in which the same or any part thereof lies, as may be appropriate under Canadian law.
"B : All movable facilities built or provided in Canada by the Government of the United States shall within one year after the cessation of hostilities, unless otherwise agreed by the two Governments, at the option of the United States Government :
(1) be removed from Canada ; or
(2) be offered for sale to the Government of Canada , or with the approval of the Government of Canada, to the Government of the appropriate Province at a price

to be fixed by a Board of two appraisers, one to be chosen by each country and with power to select a third in the case of disagreement.
"C: In the event that the United States Government has foregone its option as described in B ( 1 ) , and the Canadian Government or the Provincial Government decides to forego its option as described in B ( 2 ) , the facility under consideration shall be offered for sale in the open market, any sale to be subject to the approval of both Governments.
"D : In the event of no sale being concluded the disposition of such facility shall be referred for recommendation to the Permanent Joint Board on Defense or to such other agency as the two Governments may designate.
"The principles outlined above shall reciprocally apply to any defense projects and installations which may be built in the United States by the Government of Canada.
"All of the foregoing provisions relate to the physical disposition and ownership of projects , installations, and facilities and are without prejudice to any agreement or agreements which may be reached between the Governments of the United States and Canada in regard to the post- war use of any of these projects, installations, and facilities."

It gives me pleasure to inform you that the Canadian Government has also approved this Recommendation and has so informed the Permanent Joint Board on Defence.
