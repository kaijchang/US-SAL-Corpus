BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

A PROCLAMATION.

Preamble.
Appointment of November 24,1881, as a day of thanksgiving-

It has long been the pious custom of our people, with the closing of the year, to look back upon the blessings brought to them in the chang-

ing course of the seasons, and to return solemn thanks to the All-giving Source from Whom they flow. And although at this period, when the falling leaf admonishes us that the time of our sacred duty is at hand,

our Nation still lies in the shadow of a great bereavement, and the mourning which has filled our hearts still finds its sorrowful expression toward

the God before Whom we but lately bowed in grief and supplication,

yet the countless benefits which have showered upon us during the past

twelvemonth call for our fervent gratitude and make it fitting that we

should rejoice with thankfulness that the Lord, in His infinite mercy

has most signally favored our country and our people. Peace without

and prosperity within have been vouchsafed to us, no pestilence has

visited our shores, the abundant privileges of freedom which our fathers

left us iu their wisdom are still our increasing heritage,--and if, in parts

of our vast domain, sore affliction has visited our brethren in their forest

homes, yet even this calamity has been tempered and in a manner sanc-

tified by the generous compassion for the sufferers which has been called

forth throughout our land. For all these things, it is meet that the

voice of the Nation should go up to God in devout homage.

Wherefore I, Chester A. Arthur, President of the United States, do

recommend that all the people observe Thursday, the twenty-fourth day

of November instant, as a day of National Thanksgiving and Prayer,

by ceasing so far as may be from their secular labors, and meeting iu

their several places of worship, there to join in ascribing honor and

praise to Almighty God, whose goodness has been so manifest in our

history and in our lives, and offering earnest prayers that His bounties

may continue to us and to our children.

In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal

of the United States to be affixed.

Done at the city of Washington this fourth day of November in the

Artic le III.

1. According to the laws of Madagascar from all time, Malagasy lands cannot be sold to foreigners, and, therefore, citizens and proteges of the United States of America are prohibited from purchasing lands in Madagascar; but still they shall be permitted to lease or rent lands, houses, or storehouses for a term of months or years, mutually

can agree with the lessor (proprietor of the land), renew the lease by periods not exceeding twenty-five years for any one term ; and the conditions agreed upon by the parties for such renewals are to be inserted in the lease.
However, every renewal must be acknowledged at the time of making it before the proper authorities, as hereinafter provided in section 9

of this article for executing leases for lands and houses; and the same fee may be exacted.

2. United States citizens and proteges shall be permitted to build houses and magazines, of any material desired, on land leased by them, according to the agreement made with the owner; and when the lease contains a condition permitting the lessee to remove the buildings and fixtures so constructed by him, the same shall be removed within three months after the final expiration of the lease; otherwise they shall become the property of the owner of the land.
3. This privilege of leasing lands and building thereon by United States citizens and proteges shall not be construed as a right to build fortifications of whatever nature, nor to mine on the lands; and should any minerals be accidentally found on such lands, they are to be left to the disposition of Her Majesty's Government, and no agreement will be valid made between parties to avoid this clause relative to minerals.

be at liberty to do so, and be paid up to the time of leaving on giving one month's previous notice.
6. This notice, however, shall not be required from the Government of Madagascar, when Her Majesty the Queen shall have immediate and unexpected need of the services of such laborers; but the officers of the Government in taking such laborers for government service will avoid taking the skilled laborers--those who have become habituated to the special avocations in which they are employed--and the permanently employed servants, when the circumstances will admit. And the Queen calling such laborers for soldiers or other pressing Government service, shall be considered as the circumstances under which they may be taken without the notice, and paid up to the time of leav-
ing. The above restriction is intended to prevent the local authorities
from taking such permanent laborers from their employers, but not to i nterfere with the right of Her Majesty the Queen of Madagascar to call them to government service when needed.
7. Mail carriers, and bearers of dispatches, and bearers of freight, as well as the servants and bearers of travelers employed by United States citizens and protegEs, and provided with passports from the Malagasy Government, will not be taken away while en route, but must be permitted to finish their journeys. Nevertheless, such persons, if transgressing the law, will not be exempt from arrest even while on the journey.
8. Slaves shall be allowed to engage themselves with United States citizens and protegEs for short periods, where their masters are far away, or where it is not known whether they are slaves or not, but if they are demanded by their masters they shall be allowed to leave, and be paid up to the time of leaving, without giving the one month's previous notice.
9. Contracts for renting or leasing lands or houses, or hiring laborers, shall be executed by leases for lands and contracts for labor in writing which shall be executed before the United States consular officer and the governor of the district where such consular officer resides, or instead of said governor such officer as he may delegate for such duty, who, when satisfied that the parties have the right to make the contract, shall approve it in writing signed by them, and sealed with their official government seals.
10. And for such service a fee not exceeding two dollars ($2) may be exacted for each official seal. But when the period contracted for, for labor does exceed six mouths, procuring this official approval shall be optional with the parties.
11. And the United States consular officer, as well as the governor of the district where such officer resides, or any other local officer that may be designated by the governor for that purpose, shall approve the same without delay, unless it be in the case of some unavoidable preventing circumstances, or on a day when official business is stayed by the Queen of Madagascar.
12. On lands so leased by American citizens and protegEs, the American lessee shall pay to Her Majesty an annual tax of two cents per English square acre upon lands for cultivation, and on town lands an annual tax of one-fourth cent per English square yard.
13. This tax shall not be considered as payment in whole or in part of other taxes which may be levied on such United States citizens and protegEs, or the citizens and subjects of other nations residing in Madagascar and Malagasy subjects, not of any part of the export duty upon the productions of such lands, but as a special land tax.
14. This tax shall be paid once'each year in the month which shall be fixed by the government for its payment; and the officer who shall be designated to receive such, shall upon reception of each tax give a receipt therefor, over his signature and official seal, mentioning the day, month and year on which it was received, and describing the land upon which the tax is paid, and for what year, as a proof of payment.

TREATY--MADAGASCAR. May 13, 1881.

15. Such leases maybe transferred; iu which cases notice must be given to the government authority of Madagascar.
16. Citizens and proteges of the United States of America who come to Madagascar must present a passport from their government, or from some consul, certifying their nationality; otherwise they are liable to be prohibited from residing in Madagascar.
17. But after producing such passport, they shall be permitted to follow any occupation they wish; to print books or newspapers of a moral character, or any books or periodicals on literary, commercial, or scientific subjects, provided they are not of an unlawful character; but shall not be permitted to publish seditious criticisms upon Her Majesty's government.
18. United States citizens and proteges shall be permitted to pass with or without merchandise, with their bearers, baggage, carriers, and servants, through all parts of Madagascar which are under the control of a governor duly appointed by Her Majesty the Queen of Madagascar, with the exception of Ambohmianga, and Ambohmianambola, and
Amparafaravats, which places foreigners are not permitted to enter; and, in fact, be entitled to all privileges of commerce or other business, calling or profession granted to the most favored nation, so long as they do not infringe the laws of Madagascar.
19. The subjects of Her Majesty the Queen of Madagascar shall en-

of influencing his decision, shall be considered a felony, and that the person proved guilty of either of these offences shall be punished by the government to which he belongs, according to the grade of his crime. And if it shall be proved that a judge of these courts, of either nationality, shall have received a bribe to influence his decision in any

case, he shall be dismissed from his office of judge, and otherwise punished according to the laws of his own nation for such malfeasance.
