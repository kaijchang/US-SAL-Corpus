Preamble. Ed ward B e 1lows. Relief of.

Whereas, Edward Bellows, upon the eighteenth day of July, in the year of our Lord eighteen hundred and sixty six, was, by the President of the United States, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, duly appointed and commissioned a paymaster in the Navy of the United States from the twentieth day of February, anno Domini eighteen hundred and sixty-six; and
Whereas, on the twenty eighth day of January, anno Domini eighteen hundred and sixty-nine, the Secretary of the Navy issued an order declaring that said Bellows was dismissed the Naval service, declared in such order of dismissal to be "in consequence of the facts appearing

upon the record of the naval court martial before which he was tried, in November, eighteen hundred and sixty-eight;" and
Whereas, on the twenty-second day of January, anno Domini eighteen hundred and eighty, the President of the United States, through the Secretary of the Navy, after investigation of the facts in the case, determined and issued an order declaring that said order of dismissal was illegal and void, and annulled and revoked, because issued contrary to the provisions of section sixteen hundred and twenty-four, article thirtysix, page two hundred and eighty-two of the Revised Statutes of the United States, and the name of said Edward Bellows was thereupon, by order of the President, restored to the list of Paymasters on the Naval Register, next after that of Paymaster George A. Lyon, being the original relative position held by him on that list, and to which he is entitled by virtue of his commission, which position on said list the said Bellows has ever since held and now holds, and
Whereas, on the sixteenth day of March, anno Domini eighteen hundred and sixty-nine, while the said order of dismissal remained upon the records unrevoked, the President of the United States, under the mistaken belief that said order of dismissal was valid and according to law, and that the same caused a vacancy, by reason of said dismissal, in the list of paymasters, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate appointed Leonard A. Frailey paymaster in the Navy, declaring such appointment to be " vice Bellows, dismissed;" and
Whereas, by a recent decision and judgment of the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Charles M. Blake versus the United States (thirteenth Otto, page two hundred and twenty-seven) said decision makes questionable the right of said Bellows to hold said office; and
Whereas, including the said Bellows, the present number of paymasters does not exceed the number now allowed bylaw : Therefore
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the President of the United States be, and he hereby is, authorized to nominate and, with the advice and consent of the Senate, appoint the said Edward Bellows paymaster in the Navy of the United States, to take rank and position on the list of such paymasters in the position where his name now stands on the Register as above stated: Provided, That such appointment shall not entitle the said Edward Bellows to compensation during the time his name was not borne on said list, and during which he was not recognized as a paymaster in the service; Provided further, That after such appointment the said Edward Bellows shall be entitled to longevity pay upon his said commission of date February twentieth, eighteen hundred and sixty-six.

Whereas, on the twenty-second day of January, anno Domini eighteen hundred and eighty, the President of the United States, through the Secretary of the Navy, after investigation of the facts in the case, determined and issued an order declaring that said order of dismissal was illegal and void, and annulled and revoked, because issued contrary to the provisions of section sixteen hundred and twenty-four, article thirtysix, page two hundred and eighty-two of the Revised Statutes of the United States, and the name of said Edward Bellows was thereupon, by order of the President, restored to the list of Paymasters on the Naval Register, next after that of Paymaster George A. Lyon, being the original relative position held by him on that list, and to which he is entitled by virtue of his commission, which position on said list the said Bellows has ever since held and now holds, and
Whereas, on the sixteenth day of March, anno Domini eighteen hundred and sixty-nine, while the said order of dismissal remained upon the records unrevoked, the President of the United States, under the mistaken belief that said order of dismissal was valid and according to law, and that the same caused a vacancy, by reason of said dismissal, in the list of paymasters, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate appointed Leonard A. Frailey paymaster in the Navy, declaring such appointment to be " vice Bellows, dismissed;" and
Whereas, by a recent decision and judgment of the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Charles M. Blake versus the United States (thirteenth Otto, page two hundred and twenty-seven) said decision makes questionable the right of said Bellows to hold said office; and
Whereas, including the said Bellows, the present number of paymasters does not exceed the number now allowed bylaw : Therefore
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the President of the United States be, and he hereby is, authorized to nominate and, with the advice and consent of the Senate, appoint the said Edward Bellows paymaster in the Navy of the United States, to take rank and position on the list of such paymasters in the position where his name now stands on the Register as above stated: Provided, That such appointment shall not entitle the said Edward Bellows to compensation during the time his name was not borne on said list, and during which he was not recognized as a paymaster in the service; Provided further, That after such appointment the said Edward Bellows shall be entitled to longevity pay upon his said commission of date February twentieth, eighteen hundred and sixty-six.

Preamble.
Suit, etc., authorized to be brought in Court of Claims; court to have jurisdiction, etc.

Whereas, the United States, on the eighteenth day of June, eighteen hundred and sixty five, chartered the steamboat Jackson to run on the Chattahoochee River in the service of the United States, and while so employed it was wholly destroyed by fire caused by unavoidable acci-
dent; and Whereas the Secretary of the Treasury, on the application of Aaron
Barnett and Daniel Fry for payment to them, as alleged owners of said steamboat, of the value of the same, adjudged and decided "that the Steamer Jackson was lost by unavoidable accident while in the military service of the United States by contract, and that the owners thereof were entitled to the payment of the value thereof under acts of March third, eighteen hundred and forty nine, and March third, eighteen hun-
dred and sixty three"; and Whereas the value of said Steamer was duly ascertained by the
Treasury Department to be thirty six thousand one hundred and twenty five dollars, which was paid to the said Barnett and Fry, on the execution of the bond of said Barnett as principal and Louis G. Schiffer and Gabriel H. Schiffer as sureties, in the sum of twenty six thousand dollars, payable to the United States, and "conditioned that if the above bounden obligors their heirs, executors, administrators, or any of them, shall and do well and truly pay or cause to be paid unto any person or persons who shall establish a valid claim to any of the five fourteenths of the steamer Jackson the full amounts as paid by the United States to the said Barnett and Fry, or shall pay or cause to be paid unto the United States, or their assigns, the full amounts paid by the United States on account of said five fourteenths of the said steamer Jackson, with the legal costs and interest on such sum, without any defalcation or delay, then the said bond to be void", and so forth; and
Whereas John R. Ely, John B. Lockey, A R. Godwin, S. and J. Irwin, Thomas M. White, surviving partner of T, and J. M, White, and Ellison and Hughs, partners or joint owners, claim that they are the owners of said five fourteenths of said steamer Jackson, in different number of shares, and entitled to their pro rata share of said thirty six thousand one hundred and twenty five dollars, amounting to twelve thousand nine hundred and one dollars and seventy eight cents, and have demanded payment of the same from the United States; and
Whereas Barnett and Fry deny the ownership of said claimants of said five fourteenths, and also claim that they (Barnett and Fry) have made payments and advances of large sums of money for and on account of repairs and materials for repairs of said steamer Jackson, which they are entitled to have deducted from any sum for which they may be liable on said bond, or on account of said payment to them of the said twelve thousand nine hundred and one dollars and seventy eight cents; Therefore for the purpose of having the real owners of said five fourteenths of said steamer Jackson legally ascertained, and to enable the said Barnett and Fry, in the event that said claimants, or any of them, shall establish their right to said five fourteenths or any part thereof, to show by legal proof what, if any, advances or payments they, or either of them, have made for and on account of any repairs of the said steamer, and legally chargeable against all the owners thereof.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That John R. Ely, John B. Lockey, A. R. Godwin, S, and J. Irwin, partners or joint owners, and Thomas M. White, surviving partner of T and J. M. White, and Ellison and Hughs partners or joint owners, be, and they are hereby authorized within six months and not thereafter, after the passage of this act to bring suit in their joint names in the Court of Claims against the United States, and that said Court of Claims shall have jurisdiction of said suit to hear and determine the same for the purposes aforesaid, and to try all issues joined between the parties thereto in relation to the owner-

Wash in gt on , Saturday, January 20, 1883. The Commissioners met, and upon further discussion the United States Commissioners consented to accept Article V. as submitted by the Mexican Commissioners. The remaining articles of the treaty were considered, and the treaty signed, with the following agreement: As to steel tools. Whereas the Mexican Commissioners state that although in their instructions the word steel (acero) is omitted from the item No. (35) 66 of the list of merchandise of the United States to be admitted into Mexico, free of duty, appended to article 2 of the said treaty, which reads as follows: "Tools and instruments of iron, brass, or wood, or composed of these articles, for artisans," they doubt whether this omission is intentional or casual, and have Consulted about it by the cable with their Government; and Whereas the United States Commissioners assert that if tools wholly or partly of steel for the use of artisans be excluded from the benefits of the treaty, the item in question is practically of no value as a concession to the United States.

As to local taxation in Mexico.

The Commissioners, Ulysses S. Grant and William H. Trescot, on the part of the United States, and Matias Romero and Estanislao Cafiedo, on the part of Mexico, met at the State Department at 1 o'clock, January 15, 1883.
Upon submitting to each other their respective powers, the Commissioners of the United States called to the attention of the Commissioners of Mexico that while the powers of the former were full, the powers of the latter were confined to the execution of such a Treaty as was prescribed in their instructions, and as these instructions were unknown to the United States Commissioners, the powers could scarcely be considered " like and equal."
The Mexican Commissioners said they proposed to communicate their instructions, and, at the request of the United States Commissioners, consented to attach them to their powers as part thereof.
As these instructions referred to a draft of a treaty in possession of the Mexican Commissioners as representing the views of the Mexican Government, it was agreed that the treaty should be read.
It was accordingly read, article by article. Upon the reading of the first article, the United States Commissioners stated that complaints had been made that merchandise going from the United States into Mexico and subject to duty was not only so taxed at the port of entry, but was subject to extra taxation imposed upon the border line of every State of the Mexican Republic through which it might pass. They wished to know whether the condition of Mexican law, taken in connection with the language of this article, exempting goods on the free list from all " taxation whether Federal or local", was such as to secure these goods from local taxation. The Mexican Commissioners said: "That section I. of article 112 of the Federal Constitution of the United States of Mexico provides that the States cannot levy any tax upon tonnage or any other port duty, or upon imports and exports unless they are authorized to do so by the Federal Congress. That the Federal Congress has not authorized the States to levy any tax upon imports and exports, and could not give any such authority if this project became a treaty, so far as the articles embraced in Article 2 of the treaty are concerned. "That, therefore, if any State should attempt to collect any tax on said articles, or

COMMERCIAL CONVENTION--MEXICO. January 20,1883.

any other foreign articles, in Mexico, the interested parties could apply to the proper courts and have the wrong remedied in accordance with the Mexican laws."
Having considered Articles 1 and,2, with the respective free lists, the Commission adjourned to meet on Tuesday, the iGth instant, at 10 o'clock.

Washi ngt on , Tuesday, January 16, 1883. The Commissioners met at 10 o'clock. The reading of the articles of the treaty draft was renewed. In connection with Articles 3 and 4, the United States Commissioners suggested that, without making any alteration in the substance of the articles, it would be desirable if some concert could be had in the establishment of such customs regulations as might be found necessary for proof of the character of the merchandise made free under the provisions of the Treaty; and they considered it important that the official examination of such merchandise once made at the port of original entry should be sufficient to carry such goods to their point of destination without further examination. The Mexican Commissioners said that the Mexican Government was now endeavoring to modify its customs regulations; that a Commissioner was appointed to come to the United States to examine the customs regulations between the United States and Canada, who has reported favorably upon the adoption of that system, and that a Commission was now sitting in Mexico for the revision of the tariff, anti would probably adopt that system; that the introduction and development of railroads would require a change in the present system, and that they had no doubt some plan would be devised by which goods could be carried under bond to their point of final destination; that, as they had explained before, no separate State had the right to levy taxes upon imports without the consent of the Federal Congress, and that goods declared free, having once passed the custom house of original entry, or having arrived at the place of destination, if the bond system was adopted, would not need any further justification. The remaining articles of the draft, with the exception of Article 5, were then read, and in some respects modified. Article V. was then read. The United States Commissioners submitted a modification by which the free lists were made the exclusive privilege of the contracting parties during the term of existence of the treaty--six years. After a very full discussion, the Mexican Commissioners said that they were not authorized to accept the modification; and the United States Commissioners replied that under their instructions they were not authorized to accept the article without some modification. The subject was referred for further discussion to the next meeting. The Commission then adjourned to meet on Wednesday, January 17, at 11 o'clock.

PROTECTION OF INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY. Marc h 20, 1883.

Final protocol.

FINAL PROTOCOL.

PROTOCOLE DE CLOTURE.

On proceeding to the signature of the Convention, concluded this day between the Governments of Belgium, Brazil, Spain, France, Guatemala, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Salvador, Servia, and Switzerland, for the protection of industrial property, the undersigned plenipotentiaries have agreed on the following:

Definition of "Industrial Property."

1. The words Industrial Property are to be understood in their widest acceptation, in the sense that they apply not only to the productions of industry properly so called, but equally to the productions of agriculture (wines, grains, fruits, cattle, etc.) and to mineral productions used in commerce (mineral waters, etc.).

Patents. Domestic legislation not infringed upon. Trade-marks.

2. Under the name Patents of invention are included the various classes of industrial patents granted by the laws of the contracting States, such as patents of importation, patents of improvement, etc.
3. It is understood that the final provision of Article 2 of the convention shall in no respect infringe upon the laws of each of the contracting States, so far as concerns the procedure before the courts and the competence of the said courts.
4. Paragraph 1 of Article 6 is to be understood in the sense that no trade or commercial mark shall be excluded from protection, in one of the States of the Union, by the mere fact that it may not satisfy, in respect to the signs composing it, the conditions of the laws of this State, provided that it does satisfy, in this regard, the laws of the country of origin, and that it has been in this latter country, duly deposited. Saving this exception which concerns only the form of the mark, and under reservation of the provisions of the other articles of the Convention, the domestic legislation of each of the states shall receive its due application.

In order to avoid all misinterpretation, it is understood that

Au moment de proceder a la signature de la Convention conclue, a la date de ce jour, entre les Gouvernements de la Belgique, du Bresil, de I'Espagne, de la France, du Guatemala, de 1'Italie, des Pays-Bas, du Portugal, du Salvador, de la Serbie et de la Suisse, pour la protection de la Propriete industrielle, les Plenipotentiaires soussignes sont convenus de ce qui suit:
1. Les mots Propriete industrielle doivent etre entendus dans leur acception la plus large, en ce sens qu'ils s'appliquent non seulement aux produits de 1'industrie proprement dite, mais egalement aux produits de 1'agriculture (vins, grains, fruits, bestiaux, etc.) et. aux produits mineraux livres au commerce (eaux mindrales, etc.).
2. Sous le nom de Brevets d'invention sont comprises les diverses especes de brevets industriels admises par les legislations des Etats contractants, telles que brevets d'importation, brevets de perfectionnement. etc.
3. Il est entendu que la disposition finale de I'article 2 de la Convention ne porte aucune atteinte a la legislation de chacun des Etats contractants, en ce qui concerne la procedure suivie devant les tribunaux et la compdtence de ces tribunaux.
4. Le paragraphe ler de Particle 6 doit etre entendu en ce sens qu'aucune marque de fabrique ou de commerce ne pourra etre exclue de la protection dans 1'un des Etats de 1'Union par le fait seul qu'elle ne satisferait pas, au point de vue des signes qui la composent, aux conditions de la legislation de cet Etat, pourvu qu'elle satisfasse, sur ce point, a la legislation du pays d'origine et qu'elle ait ete, dans ce dernier pays, I'objet d'un depot regulier. Sauf cette exception, qui ne concerne que la forme de la marque, et sous reserve des dispositions des autres articles de la Convention, la legislation interieure de chacun des Etats recevra son application.
Pour eviter toute fausse interpretation, il est entendu que

PROTECTION OF INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY. Mar ch 20, 1883.

the use of public armorial bearings and decorations may be considered contrary to public order, in the sense of the final paragraph of Article 6.
5. The organization of a special service of Industrial Property mentioned in Article 12 shall include, as far as is possible, the publication in each state of an official periodical.
6. The common expenses of the International Bureau, created by Article 13, shall in no case exceed yearly a sum-total representing a mean of 2,000 francs for each contracting State.
In order to determine the contributory share of each of the States this sum-total of expenses, the contracting States, and those who may hereafter adhere to the Union, shall be divided into six classes, each contributing in the proportion of a certain number of units, namely :

1'usage des armoiries publiques et des decorations pent etre considere comme contraire a 1'ordre public,dans le sens du paragraphe final de I'article 6.
5. L'organisation du service special de la Propriete industrielle mentionne a 1'article 12 comprendra, autant que possible, la publication, dans chaque Etat, d'une feuille officielle periodique.
6. Les frais communs du Bureau international institue par I'article 13 ne pourront, en aucun cas, depasser, par annee, une somme totale representant une moyenne de 2,000 francs par chaque Etat contractant.
Pour determiner la part contributive de chacun des Etats dans cette somme totale des frais, les Etats contractants et ceux qui adhereraient ulterieurement a I'Union seront divises en six classes, contribuant chacune dans la proportion d'un certain nombre d'unites, savoir :

Publication of official periodical.
Expenses of International Bureau.

Those coefficients shall be multiplied by the number of the States of each class, and the sum of the products thus obtained shall furnish the number of units by which the total expense is to be divided. The quotient will give the amount of the unit of expense.
The contracting States are classified as follows in respect to the division of the expenses :

Ces coefficients seront multiplies par le nombre des Etats de chaque classe, et la somme des produits ainsi obtenus fournira le nombre d'unites par lequel la depense totale doit etre divisee. Le quotient donnera le montant de I'unite de depense.
