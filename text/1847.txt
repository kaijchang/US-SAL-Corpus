cluded at Hanover on the 10th day of June last, by the plenipoten-

tiaries of the contracting parties, and was subsequently duly ratified

on the part of both governments :

And whereas, by the terms of the twelfth article of the same, " the

United States agree to extend all the advantages and privileges

contained in the stipulations of the present treaty to one or more of

the other States of the Germanic confederation, which may wish to

accede to them, by means of an official exchange of declarations;

provided that such State or States shall confer similar favors upon the

said United States to those conferred by the kingdom of Hanover, and

observe and be subject to the same conditions, stipulations, and

obligations: "

And whereas, the government of his Royal Highness the Grand Duke

of Oldenburg has signified its desire to accede to the said treaty, and

to all the stipulations and provisions therein contained, so far as the

same are or may be applicable to the two countries, and to become a

party thereto ; that is to say, to all the said stipulations and provisions,

excepting only those relating to the Stade, and the Weser tolls, in

which the government of Oldenburg has no interest, and over which

it has no control:

Now, therefore, the undersigned, Baron W. E. de Beaulieu Mar-

connay, of the privy council of his Royal Highness, and at the head of

the Department of Foreign Affairs, on the part of Oldenburg, and A.

D. Mann, special agent, on the part of the United States, invested with

Royal Highness the Grand Duke of Oldenburg, for the Duchy of

Oldenburg, to the treaty aforesaid, the effect of which accession and

agreement is hereby declared to be to establish the said treaty between

the high parties to this declaration, as fully and perfectly, to all intents

and purposes, as if all the provisions therein contained, excepting as

above excepted, had been recited word for word in a separate treaty,

concluded and ratified between them, in the ordinary form.

In witness whereof, the above-named plenipotentiaries have hereto

affixed their names and seals. Done at Oldenburg, this tenth day of

Satisfactory evidence that no discriminating duties are levied on vessels of the United States in the ports of Brazil.
Discriminating duties on Brazilian vessels and their cargoes suspended.
From 25th October, 1847.

And whereas satisfactory evidence has lately been received by me, from his

Majesty the Emperor of Brazil, through an official communication of Mr. Fe-

lippe Jose Pereira Leal, his charge daffaires in the United States, under date

of the 25th of October, 1847, that no other or higher duties of tonnage and

impost are imposed or levied in the ports of Brazil upon vessels wholly belong-

ing to citizens of the United States, and upon the produce, manufactures, or

merchandise imported in the same from the United States, and from any for-

eign country whatever, than are levied on Brazilian ships and their cargoes in

the same ports under like circumstances :

Now, therefore, I, James K. Polk, President of the United States of America,

do hereby declare and proclaim, that so much of the several acts imposing dis-

criminating duties of tonnage and impost within the United States are, and

shall be, suspended and discontinued so far as respects the vessels of Brazil,

and the produce, manufactures, and merchandise imported into the United

States in the same, from Brazil and from any other foreign country whatever,

the said suspension to take effect from the day above mentioned, and to con-

tinue thenceforward so long as the reciprocal exemption of the vessels of the

United States, and the produce, manufactures, and merchandise imported into

Brazil in the same as aforesaid, shall be continued on the part of the govern-

ment of Brazil. Given under my hand, at the city of Washington, this fourth day of No-
