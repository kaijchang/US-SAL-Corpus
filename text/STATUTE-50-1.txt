FORM OF CONTRACT OR SALE.-Subject to the provisions of this Act and of any statute in that behalf, a contract to sell or a sale may be made in writing (either with or without seal ) , or by word of mouth, or partly in writing and partly by word of mouth or may be inferred from the conduct of the parties.
SEC. 4. STATUTE OF FRAUDS .-- ( 1 ) A contract to sell or a sale of any goods or choses in action of the value of $500 or upwards shall not be enforceable by action unless the buyer shall accept part of the goods or choses in action so contracted to be sold or sold, and actually receive the same, or give something in earnest to bind the contract, or in part payment, or unless some note or memorandum in writing of the contract or sale be signed by the party to be charged or his agent in that behalf.
(2) The provisions of this section apply to every such contract or sale, notwithstanding that the goods may be intended to be delivered at some future time or may not at the time of such contract or sale be actually made, procured, or provided , or fit or ready for delivery, or some act may be requisite for the making or completing thereof, or rendering the same fit for delivery ; but if the goods are to be manufactured by the seller especially for the buyer and are not suitable for sale to others in the ordinary course of the seller's business, the provisions of this section shall not apply.
(3 ) There is an acceptance of goods within the meaning of this section when the buyer, either before or after delivery of the goods, expresses by words or conduct his assent to becoming the owner of those specific goods.

Subject matter of contract.

SUBJECT MATTER OF CONTRACT

and the buyer to buy a definite number, weight, or measure of the

goods in the mass, and though the number, weight, or measure of

the goods in the mass is undetermined. By such a sale the buyer

becomes owner in common of such a share of the mass as the number,

weight, or measure bought bears to the number, weight, or measure

of the mass. If the mass contains less than the number, weight,

or measure bought, the buyer becomes the owner of the whole mass

and the seller is bound to make good the deficiency from similar

goods unless a contrary intent appears.

SEO. 7. DESTRUCTION OF GOODS SOLD.- ( 1 ) Where the parties pur-

port to sell specific goods, and the goods without the knowledge of the seller have wholly perished at the time when the agreement is made, the agreement is void.

(2) Where there is a contract to sell specific goods, and subsequently, but before the risk passes to the buyer, without any fault of the seller or the buyer, part of the goods perish or the whole or a

material part of the goods so deteriorate in quality as to be substantially changed in character, the buyer may at his option treat the contract-

is to pass to the buyer : Rule 1. Where there is an unconditional contract to sell specific

goods, in a deliverable state, the property in the goods passes to the buyer when the contract is made and it is immaterial whether the time of payment , or the time of delivery, or both, be postponed.

125151-37-3

34

75TH CONGRESS, 1ST SESSION-CH. 43-MARCH 17, 1937

Rule 2. Where there is a contract to sell specific goods and the seller is bound to do something to the goods, for the purpose of

putting them into a deliverable state, the property does not pass until such thing is done.

Rule 3. (1 ) When goods are delivered to the buyer "on sale or return", or on other terms indicating an intention to make a present

sale, but to give the buyer an option to return the goods instead of

paying the price, the property passes to the buyer on delivery, but

he may revest the property in the seller by returning or tendering the goods within the time fixed in the contract, or, if no time has been fixed, within a reasonable time.
(2) When goods are delivered to the buyer on approval or on trial or on satisfaction, or other similar terms, the property therein passes to the buyer-

(a ) When he signifies his approval or acceptance to the seller or does any other act adopting the transaction ;
(b) If he does not signify his approval or acceptance to the
seller, but retains the goods without giving notice of rejection, then if a time has been fixed for the return of the goods, on the

expiration of such time, and, if no time has been fixed , on the expiration of a reasonable time. What is a reasonable time is a question of fact.

Rule 4. ( 1 ) Where there is a contract to sell unascertained or future goods by description, and goods of that description and in a deliverable state are unconditionally appropriated to the contract, either by the seller with the assent of the buyer, or by the buyer

with the assent of the seller, the property in the goods thereupon

passes to the buyer. Such assent may be expressed or implied, and may be given either before or after the appropriation is made.
(2 ) Where, in pursuance of a contract to sell, the seller delivers

the goods to the buyer, or to a carrier or other bailee (whether named

by the buyer or not) for the purpose of transmission to or holding for the buyer, he is presumed to have unconditionally appropriated the goods to the contract, except in the cases provided for in the next rule and in section 20. This presumption is applicable, although by the terms of the contract, the buyer is to pay the price before receiving delivery of the goods, and the goods are marked with the words "collect on delivery" or their equivalents.
Rule 5. If the contract to sell requires the seller to deliver the

goods to the buyer, or at a particular place, or to pay the freight or cost of transportation to the buyer, or to a particular place, the property does not pass until the goods have been delivered to the

Reservation ofright of possession or property when goods are shipped.

buyer or reached the place agreed upon. SEC. 20. RESERVATION OF RIGHT OF POSSESSION OR PROPERTY WHEN
GOODS ARE SHIPPED. (1) Where there is a contract to sell specific
goods, or where goods are subsequently appropriated to the contract, the seller may, by the terms of the contract or appropriation, reserve
the right of possession or property in the goods until certain conditions have been fulfilled . The right of possession or property may

be thus reserved notwithstanding the delivery of the goods to the buyer or to a carrier or other bailee for the purpose of transmission to the buyer.

(2) Where goods are shipped, and by the bill of lading the goods are deliverable to the seller or his agent, or to the order of the seller or of his agent, the seller thereby reserves the property in the goods. But if, except for the form of the bill of lading, the property would have passed to the buyer on shipment of the goods, the seller's property in the goods shall be deemed to be only for the purpose of

75TH CONGRESS, 1ST SESSION- CH. 43-MARCH 17, 1937

securing performance by the buyer of his obligations under the contract.
(3) Where goods are shipped , and by the bill of lading the goods are deliverable to the order of the buyer or of his agent, but possession of the bill of lading is retained by the seller or his agent, the seller thereby reserves a right to the possession of the goods as against the buyer.
(4) Where the seller of goods draws on the buyer for the price and transmits the bill of exchange and bill of lading together to the buyer to secure acceptance or payment of the bill of exchange, the buyer is bound to return the bill of lading if he does not honor the bill of exchange, and if he wrongfully retains the bill of lading he acquires no added right thereby. If, however, the bill of lading provides that the goods are deliverable to the buyer or to the order of the buyer, or is endorsed in blank, or to the buyer by the consignee named therein, one who purchases in good faith, for value, the bill of lading, or goods from the buyer will obtain the property in the goods, although the bill of exchange has not been honored, provided that such purchaser has received delivery of the bill of lading endorsed by the consignee named therein, or of the goods, without notice of the facts, making the transfer wrongful.
SEC. 21. SALE BY AUCTION.-In the case of a sale by auction(1 ) Where goods are put up for sale by auction in lots, each lot is the subject of a separate contract of sale. (2) A sale by auction is complete when the auctioneer announces its completion by the fall of the hammer, or in other customary manner. Until such announcement is made, any bidder may retract
his bid; and the auctioneer may withdraw the goods from sale unless the auction has been announced to be without reserve.

Sale by auction.

(3) A right to bid may be reserved expressly by or on behalf of the seller.

(4) Where notice has not been given that a sale by auction is subject to a right to bid on behalf of the seller, it shall not be lawful for the seller to bid himself or to employ or induce any person to
bid at such sale on his behalf, or for the auctioneer to employ or induce any person to bid at such sale on behalf of the seller or knowingly to take any bid from the seller or any person employed
by him. Any sale contravening this rule may be treated as fraudulent by the buyer.
SEC. 22. RISK OF Loss.-Unless otherwise agreed , the goods remain at the seller's risk until the property therein is transferred to the buyer, but when the property therein is transferred to the buyer the goods are at the buyer's risk whether delivery has been made or not, except that-
(a) Where delivery of the goods has been made to the buyer or to a bailee for the buyer, in pursuance of the contract and the property in the goods has been retained by the seller merely to secure performance by the buyer of his obligations under the contract, the goods are at the buyer's risk from the time of such delivery.
(b) Where delivery has been delayed through the fault of either the buyer or seller the goods are at the risk of the party in fault as regards any loss which might not have occurred but for such fault.
TRANSFER OF TITLE

Risk ofloss. Transfer of title.

negotiable document of title may be negotiated by delivery-

(a) Where by the terms of the document the carrier, warehouse-

man, or other bailee issuing the same undertakes to deliver the goods to the bearer ; or

(b) Where by the terms of the document the carrier, warehouseman, or other bailee issuing the same, undertakes to deliver the goods to the order of a specified person, and such person or a subsequent endorsee of the document has endorsed it in blank or to the bearer.

By endorsement.

Where by the terms of a negotiable document of title the goods are deliverable to bearer or where a negotiable document of title has been endorsed in blank or to bearer, any holder may endorse the same to himself or to any specified person, and in such case the document shall thereafter be negotiated only by the endorsement of such endorsee.
SEC. 29. NEGOTIATION OF NEGOTIABLE DOCUMENTS BY ENDORSEMENT.-

A negotiable document of title may be negotiated by the endorsement 1
of the person to whose offer ¹ the goods are by the terms of the docu-
ment deliverable. Such endorsement may be in blank, to bearer, or
to a specified person. If endorsed to a specified person, it may be
again negotiated by the endorsement of such person in blank, to
bearer, or to another specified person. Subsequent negotiations may be made in like manner.

carrier, warehouseman, or other bailee to deliver the goods to the bearer, to a specified person or order, or to the order of a specified

person, or which contains words of like import, has placed upon it

the words "not negotiable", "nonnegotiable", or the like, such a document may nevertheless be negotiated by the holder and is a negotiable document of title within the meaning of this Act. But nothing in

this Act contained shall be construed as limiting or defining the effect

If the document is nonnegotiable, such person also acquires the

right to notify the bailee who issued the document of the transfer thereof, and thereby to acquire the direct obligation of such bailee to hold possession of the goods for him according to the terms of the document.

Prior to the notification of such bailee by the transferor or transferee of a nonnegotiable document of title, the title of the transferee
to the goods and the right to acquire the obligation of such bailee may be defeated by the levy of an attachment or execution upon the goods by a creditor of the transferor, or by a notification to such bailee by the transferor or a subsequent purchaser from the transferor of a subsequent sale of the goods by the transferor.

SEC. 38. WHEN NEGOTIATION NOT IMPAIRED BY FRAUD, MISTAKE, OR DURESS . The validity of the negotiation of a negotiable document of title is not impaired by the fact that the negotiation was a breach of duty on the part of the person making the negotiation, or by the fact that the owner of the document was deprived of the possession of
the same by loss, theft, fraud, accident, mistake, duress, or conversion , if the person to whom the document was negotiated or a person to whom the document was subsequently negotiated paid value therefor in good faith without notice of the breach of duty, or loss, theft, fraud , accident, mistake, duress , or conversion.
SEC. 39. ATTACHMENT OR LEVY UPON GOODS FOR WHICH A NEGOTIABLE
DOCUMENT HAS BEEN ISSUED.-If goods are delivered to a bailee by the owner or by a person whose act in conveying the title to them to a purchaser in good faith for value would bind the owner and a negotiable document of title is issued for them, they cannot thereafter, while in the possession of such bailee, be attached by garnishment or otherwise or be levied under an execution unless the document be first

SEC. 43. PLACE, TIME, AND MANNER OF DELIVERY. (1 ) Whether it is for the buyer to take possession of the goods or for the seller to send them to the buyer is a question depending in each case on the contract, express or implied, between the parties. Apart from any

Place, time, and manner ofdelivery.

such contract, express or implied , or usage of trade to the contrary, the place of delivery is the seller's place of business if he have one, and if not his residence ; but in case of a contract to sell or a sale of specific goods, which to the knowledge of the parties when the contract or the sale was made were in some other place, then that

place is the place of delivery. (2) Where by a contract to sell or a sale the seller is bound to send
the goods to the buyer, but no time for sending them is fixed , the seller is bound to send them within a reasonable time.

(3) Where the goods at the time of sale are in the possession of a third person, the seller has not fulfilled his obligation to deliver

to the buyer unless and until such third person acknowledges to the buyer that he holds the goods on the buyer's behalf; but as against all others than the seller the buyer shall be regarded as having received delivery from the time when such third person first has notice of the sale. Nothing in this section, however, shall affect the operation of the issue or transfer of any document of title to goods.

(4) Demand or tender of delivery may be treated as ineffectual unless made at a reasonable hour. What is a reasonable hour is a

question of fact.

(5) Unless otherwise agreed, the expenses of and incidental to

putting the goods into a deliverable state must be borne by the seller.
SEC. 44. DELIVERY OF WRONG QUANTITY.- (1) Where the seller delivers to the buyer a quantity of goods less than he contracted to sell, the buyer may reject them, but if the buyer accepts or retains the goods so delivered, knowing that the seller is not going to perform the contract in full, he must pay for them at the contract rate. If, however, the buyer has used or disposed of the goods delivered before he knows that the seller is not going to perform his contract

Delivery of wrong quantity.

in full, the buyer shall not be liable for more than the fair value to him of the goods so received.
(2 ) Where the seller delivers to the buyer a quantity of goods larger than he contracted to sell, the buyer may accept the goods included in the contract and reject the rest, or he may reject the whole. If the buyer accepts the whole of the goods so delivered he must pay for them at the contract rate.

(3) Where the seller delivers to the buyer the goods he contracted to sell mixed with goods of a different description not included in

the contract, the buyer may accept the goods which are in accordance with the contract and reject the rest, or he may reject the whole.

(4) The provisions of this section are subject to any usage of
trade, special agreement, or course of dealing between the parties. SEC. 45. DELIVERY IN INSTALLMENTS .- ( 1 ) Unless otherwise agreed ,
the buyer of goods is not bound to accept delivery thereof by installments.

Delivery in install. ments.

(2 ) Where there is a contract to sell goods to be delivered by stated installments, which are to be separately paid for, and the seller makes defective deliveries in respect of one or more installments, or the buyer neglects or refuses to make delivery of or pay for one or more installments, it depends in each case on the terms of the contract and the circumstances of the case, whether the breach

of contract is so material as to justify the injured party in refusing to proceed further and suing for damages for breach of the entire

contract, or whether the breach is severable, giving rise to a claim for compensation but not to a right to treat the whole contract as broken.
SEC. 46. DELIVERY TO A CARRIER ON BEHALF OF THE BUYER.- ·(1) Where, in pursuance of a contract to sell or a sale, the seller is authorized or required to send the goods to the buyer, delivery of the goods to a carrier, whether named by the buyer or not, for the purpose of transmission to the buyer is deemed to be a delivery of the goods to the buyer, except in the cases provided for in section 19, rule 5, or unless a contrary intent appears.

(2 ) Unless otherwise authorized by the buyer, the seller must make such contract with the carrier on behalf of the buyer as may

be reasonable, having regard to the nature of the goods and the other circumstances of the case. If the seller omit so to do, and the

goods are lost or damaged in course of transit, the buyer may decline to treat the delivery to the carrier as a delivery to himself, or may hold the seller responsible in damages.

(3 ) Unless otherwise agreed , where goods are sent by the seller to the buyer under circumstances in which the seller knows or ought to know that it is usual to insure, the seller must give such notice to

the buyer as may enable him to insure them during their transit, and , if the seller fails to do so, the goods shall be deemed to be at his risk during such transit.
SEC. 47. RIGHT TO EXAMINE THE GOODS .- ( 1 ) Where goods are delivered to the buyer which he has not previously examined , he is not

deemed to have accepted them unless and until he has had a reason-

able opportunity of examining them for the purpose of ascertaining whether they are in conformity with the contract.
(2) Unless otherwise agreed, when the seller tenders delivery of

goods to the buyer, he is bound, on request, to afford the buyer a reasonable opportunity of examining the goods for the purpose of ascertaining whether they are in conformity with the contract.

What constitutes acceptance.

(3) Where goods are delivered to a carrier by the seller, in accordance with an order from or agreement with the buyer, upon the terms that the goods shall not be delivered by the carrier to the buyer until he has paid the price, whether such terms are indicated by marking the goods with the words "collect on delivery", or otherwise, the buyer is not entitled to examine the goods before payment of the price in the absence of agreement permitting such examination.
SEO. 48. WHAT CONSTITUTES ACCEPTANCE. The buyer is deemed to have accepted the goods when he intimates to the seller that he has accepted them, or when the goods have been delivered to him, and he does any act in relation to them which is inconsistent with the

ages.

ownership of the seller, or when , after the lapse of a reasonable time, he retains the goods without intimating to the seller that he has rejected them.
SEC. 49. ACCEPTANCE DOES NOT BAR ACTION FOR DAMAGES.-In the
absence of express or implied agreement of the parties, acceptance

of the goods by the buyer shall not discharge the seller from liability in damages or other legal remedy for breach of any promise or warranty in the contract to sell or the sale. But, if, after acceptance of

the goods , the buyer fail to give notice to the seller of the breach of any promise or warranty within a reasonable time after the buyer

knows, or ought to know of such breach, the seller shall not be liable therefor.

buyer, and he refused to accept them, having the right so to do , he

is not bound to return them to the seller, but it is sufficient if he notifies the seller that he refuses to accept them.
SEC. 51. BUYER'S LIABILITY FOR FAILING TO ACCEPT DELIVERY.---When
the seller is ready and willing to deliver the goods, and requests the buyer to take delivery, and the buyer does not within a reasonable time after such request take delivery of the goods, he is liable to the seller for any loss occasioned by his neglect or refusal to take delivery, and also for a reasonable charge for the care and custody of the goods. If the neglect or refusal of the buyer to take delivery amounts to a repudiation or breach of the entire contract, the seller shall have the right against the goods and on the contract hereinafter provided in favor of the seller when the buyer is in default.

(a) If the buyer, or his agent in that behalf, obtains delivery of the goods before their arrival at the appointed destination ;
(b) If, after the arrival of the goods at the appointed destination, the carrier or other bailee acknowledges to the buyer or his agent that he holds the goods on his behalf and continues in possession of them as bailee for the buyer or his agent ; and it is immaterial that a further destination for the goods may have been indicated by the buyer ; and
(c ) If the carrier or other bailee wrongfully refuses to deliver the goods to the buyer or his agent in that behalf.
(3) If goods are delivered to a ship chartered by the buyer, it is a question depending on the circumstances of the particular case, whether they are in the possession of the master as a carrier or as agent of the buyer.
(4) If part delivery of the goods has been made to the buyer, or his agent in that behalf, the remainder of the goods may be stopped in transitu, unless such part delivery has been made under such circumstances as to show an agreement with the buyer to give up possession of the whole of the goods.
SEC. 59. WAYS OF EXERCISING THE RIGHT TO STOP.-(1) The unpaid seller may exercise his right of stoppage in transitu either by obtaining actual possession of the goods or by giving notice of his claim to the carrier or other bailee in whose possession the goods are. Such notice may be given either to the person in actual possession of the

75TH CONGRESS, 1ST SESSION-CH. 43-MARCH 17, 1937

goods or to his principal. In the latter case the notice, to be effectual, must be given at such time and under such circumstances that the principal, by the exercise of reasonable diligence, may prevent a delivery to the buyer.
(2) When notice of stoppage in transitu is given by the seller to the carrier, or other bailee in possession of the goods, he must redeliver the goods to, or according to the directions of, the seller. The expenses of such delivery must be borne by the seller. If, however, a negotiable document of title representing the goods has been issued
by the carrier or other bailee, he shall not be obliged to deliver or justified in delivering the goods to the seller unless such document is first surrendered for cancelation.

RESALE BY THE SELLER

Resale by sellor.

SEC. 60. WHEN AND HOW RESALE MAY BE MADE.- ( 1 ) Where the goods are of perishable nature, or where the seller expressly reserves the right of resale in case the buyer should make default, or where the buyer has been in default in the payment of the price an unreasonable time, an unpaid seller having a right of lien or having stopped the goods in transitu may resell the goods. He shall not thereafter be liable to the original buyer upon the contract to sell or the sale or for any profit made by such resale, but may recover from the buyer damages for any loss occasioned by the breach of the contract or the sale.

When and how resale may be made.

(2) Where a resale is made, as authorized in this section, the buyer acquires a good title as against the original buyer.
(3) It is not essential to the validity of a resale that notice of an intention to resell the goods be given by the seller to the original buyer. But where the right to resell is not based on the perishable nature of the goods or upon an express provision of the contract or
the sale, the giving or failure to give such notice shall be relevant in any issue involving the question whether the buyer had been in default an unreasonable time before the resale was made.
(4) It is not essential to the validity of a resale that notice of the time and place of such resale should be given by the seller to the original buyer.
(5) The seller is bound to exercise reasonable care and judgment in making a resale, and subject to this requirement may make a resale either by public or private sale.

RESCISSION BY THE SELLER

Rescission by seller.

SEC. 61. WHEN AND HOW THE SELLER MAY RESCIND THE SALE.- (1)
An unpaid seller having the right of lien or having stopped the goods in transitu, may rescind the transfer of title and resume the property in the goods, where he expressly reserved the right to do so in case the buyer should make default, or where the buyer has been in default in the payment of the price an unreasonable time. The seller shall not thereafter be liable to the buyer upon the contract to sell or the sale, but may recover from the buyer damages for any loss occasioned by the breach of the contract or the sale.
(2) The transfer of title shall not be held to have been rescinded by an unpaid seller until he has manifested by notice to the buyer or by some other overt act an intention to rescind. It is not necessary that such overt act should be communicated to the buyer, but the giving or failure to give notice to the buyer of the intention to rescind shall be relevant in any issue involving the question whether the buyer had been in default an unreasonable time before the right of rescission was asserted.

SEC. 62. EFFECT OF SALE OF GOODS SUBJECT TO LIEN OR STOPPAGE IN TRANSITU. Subject to the provisions of this Act, the unpaid seller's
right of lien or stoppage in transitu is not affected by any sale , or other disposition of the goods which the buyer may have made , unless the seller has assented thereto.

If, however, a negotiable document of title has been issued for goods, no seller's lien or right of stoppage in transitu shall defeat the right of any purchaser for value in good faith to whom such document has been negotiated, whether such negotiations be prior or subsequent to the notification to the carrier, or other bailee who issued such document, of the seller's claim to a lien or right of stoppage in transitu.

SEC. 63. ACTION FOR THE PRICE.-- ( 1 ) Where, under a contract to sell or a sale, the property in the goods has passed to the buyer, and the buyer wrongfully neglects or refuses to pay for the goods according to the terms of the contract or the sale, the seller may maintain an

action against him for the price of the goods. (2 ) Where, under a contract to sell or a sale, the price is payable on
a day certain, irrespective of delivery or of transfer of title, and the

buyer wrongfully neglects or refuses to pay such price, the seller may maintain an action for the price, although the property in the goods

has not passed, and the goods have not been appropriated to the contract. But it shall be a defense to such an action that the seller at any time before judgment in such action has manifested an inability to perform the contract or the sale on his part or an intention not to perform it.

(3) Although the property in the goods has not passed , if they cannot readily be resold for a reasonable price, and if the provisions of section 64 (4) are not applicable, the seller may offer to deliver the
goods to the buyer, and, if the buyer refuses to receive them, may notify the buyer that the goods are thereafter held by the seller as bailee for the buyer. Thereafter the seller may treat the goods as the

(3 ) Where there is an available market for the goods in question, the measure of damages is, in the absence of special circumstances, showing proximate damage of a greater amount, the difference between the contract price and the market or current price at the time or times when the goods ought to have been accepted, or, if no time was fixed for acceptance, then at the time of the refusal to accept.
(4) If, while labor or expense of material amount are necessary on the part of the seller to enable him to fulfill his obligations under the contract to sell or the sale, the buyer repudiates the contract or the sale, or notifies the seller to proceed no further therewith, the
buyer shall be liable to the seller for no greater damages than the seller would have suffered if he did nothing toward carrying out the contract or the sale after receiving notice of the buyer's repudia-
tion or countermand. The profit the seller would have made if the contract or the sale had been fully performed shall be considered in estimating such damages.

(6) The measure of damages for breach of warranty is the loss directly and naturally resulting, in the ordinary course of events, from the breach of warranty.
(7) In the case of breach of warranty of quality, such loss, in the absence of special circumstances showing proximate damage of a
greater amount, is the difference between the value of the goods at the time of delivery to the buyer and the value they would have had if they had answered to the warranty.

constitute a fair and equitable basis for determining the monthly compensation for service prior to January 1, 1937, the Board shall

determine the monthly compensation for such service in such manner

as in its judgment shall be just and equitable. If the employee earned compensation after June 30, 1937, and after the last day of the month in which he attained age sixty-five, such compensation

If the person or persons designated to receive the death benefit do not survive the widow or widower, the death benefit shall be paid to the legal representative of the deceased.

on the 14th day of April 1937 by the representatives of the States of

the Department of State of the United States and reads as follows :

brPidogret,semtoc.uth-Kittery INTERSTATE BRIDGE AUTHORITY FOR THE PORTSMOUTH-KITTERY BRIDGE AND APPROACHES THERETO

COMPACT

BETWEEN THE STATE OF MAINE AND THE STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE

Compact relative to bridge construction
aRcirvoesrs. Piscataqua

Whereas, the single highway bridge serving as the sole facility for vehicular traffic over and across the Piscataqua river between the state of New Hampshire and the state of Maine is wholly inadequate to care for and accommodate such traffic over said river between the

said two states and therefore causes such traffic congestion in and upon the streets and highways of the city of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and the town of Kittery, Maine, that the lives and property of the citizens of said communities and the travelers on said streets and highways are constantly endangered ; and
Whereas, the antiquated and obsolete wooden pile bridge serving as the sole facility for railroad traffic over and across the Piscataqua river between the state of New Hampshire and state of Maine is wholly inadequate to care for and accommodate the railroad traffic between the said two states ; and
Whereas, the narrow draw-span of said wooden pile railroad bridge the sole facility permitting passage of water traffic up and down said river is wholly inadequate to permit the passage of steamers and vessels of broad beam from the sea inland to serve the

large industrial plants now situate on the banks of said river and therefore constitutes an obstacle to further enlargement of these industries and the development of numerous other industrial sites located so that passage through said bridge is absolutely necessary ; and

Whereas, the only remedy for the conditions now existing is the construction of a bridge across said river which by coordinating the facilities required by vehicular and railroad traffic will remove the obstacle to water traffic ; and

Whereas, the solution to this problem will result in great economy and benefit not only to the states of Maine and New Hampshire but to the nation and will require the cordial cooperation of the states of New Hampshire and Maine in the encouragement of the investment of capital as well as the formulation and execution of the necessary plans and such result can best be accomplished through the joining of the two states of Maine and New Hampshire by and through a common agency.
Now therefore, the said states of New Hampshire and Maine do hereby agree and pledge each to the other as follows :

ARTICLE I

Said states agree to and pledge, each to the other, faithful cooperation in the planning, execution and construction of a suitable vehicu-

TITLE I-POLICY AND INTENT

Preamble:

Whereas enforcement among the industrial States of the Union of reasonably uniform standards for labor in industry, determined

in accordance with the general welfare, would not only benefit labor but would be of real advantage to employers, removing the pressure

toward low wages, long hours of work, exploitation of minors and

women, and similar action commonly admitted to be injurious to all concerned ; and

Whereas the advantages of such uniform standards have already been indicated by the operation of the National Industrial Recovery Act

and the codes of fair competition adopted thereunder ; and Whereas such operation points to the desirability of continued uni-

form legislation affecting labor standards, by Federal action or otherwise, and of joint action by the States to establish such uniform standards ; and

Whereas the establishment of reasonably uniform standards in States

concerned with the same general fields of industry and competitors

in the same markets will afford the advantages of stability in labor

JOINT RESOLUTION

Granting the consent of Congress to a compact between the States of New York
and New Jersey providing for the creation of the Palisades Interstate Park Commission as a joint corporate municipal instrumentality of said States with appropriate rights, powers, duties, and immunities, for the transfer to said com-
mission of certain functions, jurisdiction, rights, powers, and duties together with the properties of the bodies politic now existing in each State known as "Commissioners of the Palisades Interstate Park" , and for the continuance of the Palisades Interstate Park.

August 19, 1937 [H.J. Res. 445]
Pub. Res., No. 65]

Whereas, pursuant to chapter 170 of the Laws of 1937 of the State of New York and chapter 148 of the Laws of 1937 of the State of New Jersey, the States of New York and New Jersey entered into a compact which is as follows :

Palisades Interstate Park Commission.
Compact between
New York and New

"COMPACT

"Whereas, heretofore the states of New York and New Jersey have cooperated in the establishment and maintenance of an interstate park along the front of the Palisades in said states and in the mountainous lands in Rockland and Orange counties in the state of New York, by respectively enacting legislation creating in each state a body politic by the name and style of "Commissioners of the Palisades Interstate Park", with power to acquire lands for such park, and improve and manage the same, and by respectively appointing, in practically all cases, the same persons as members of each of such state bodies politic ; and
"Whereas, it is confidently believed that the creation, by interstate compact, of a joint corporate municipal instrumentality to hold and manage such interstate park will provide greater flexibility and harmony in the management of the park,
"Now, therefore, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual advantages and benefits to accrue to the peoples of the states of New York and New Jersey from this compact and in consideration of the mutual covenants of the parties hereto herein contained, the sovereign state of New York and the sovereign state of New Jersey do hereby agree as follows :
"ARTICLE I

"The park or parks in the state of New York under the jurisdiction, management or control of Commissioners of the Palisades Interstate Park, a body politic created pursuant to chapter one hundred seventy of the laws of nineteen hundred of the state of New York (hereinafter referred to as "New York state board") , and the park or parks in the state of New Jersey now under the jurisdiction, management or control of Commissioners of the Palisades Interstate Park, a body politic created pursuant to chapter eighty-seven of the laws of nineteen hundred of the state of New Jersey (hereinafter referred to as "New Jersey state board," the New York state board and the New Jersey state board being hereinafter referred to collectively as "state boards" ) , shall continue to exist and shall be maintained in the two states as an interstate park for the use of the public and for the purpose of preserving the scenic beauty of the Palisades and other lands therein. Such park shall be called "Palisades Interstate Park." The parties hereto do hereby agree to and pledge, each to the other, faithful co-operation

720

75TH CONGRESS, 1ST SESSION- CH. 706-AUGUST 19, 1937
in the future planning, improvement, development, maintenance, government and management of the park, holding in high trust for the benefit of the public the special blessings and natural advantages thereof.
"ARTICLE II
"There is hereby created a body corporate and politic with the name and style of 'Palisades Interstate Park Commission' (for brevity hereinafter referred to as ' the commission ') which shall be a joint corporate municipal instrumentality of both the state of New York and the state of New Jersey for the purpose of effecting the objects of this compact and which shall be deemed to be performing governmental functions of the two states in the performance of its duties hereunder. The commission shall have power to sue and be sued, to use a common seal and to make and adopt suitable by-laws. The commission shall consist of ten members, five of whom shall be citizens and residents of the state of New York and five of whom shall be citizens and residents of the state of New Jersey. For the purpose of doing business the members of the commission shall constitute a board. The present members of the two state boards shall be the first members of the commission for their respective states for the remainder of the terms for which they were respectively appointed. Each member of the commission shall be a citizen and resident of the state of which his predecessor was a citizen and each member of the commission other than the first members shall be appointed by the governor of the state of which his predecessor was a citizen, by and with the approval of the senate of such state. Each member shall take an oath of office to perform faithfully all of the duties of his office according to the best of his ability. Such oath of office may be administered by any officer of the state of which such member is a citizen who is authorized to take oaths of office of any state officer and shall be filed in the office of the secretary of state of such state. The term of office of each member other than said first members shall be five years. Each member shall hold office until his successor shall have been appointed and shall have taken his oath of office, but each term shall be deemed to commence at the end of the preceding five-year term regardless of when the incumbent is appointed or takes the oath of office. If a member shall cease to be a citizen and resident of the state for which he was appointed he shall cease to be a member of the commission. If a member of the commission shall die, resign, be removed, refuse to act, or cease to be a citizen and resident of the state for which he was appointed, the
vacancy so created shall be filled, for the unexpired term only, by the appointment of a citizen and resident of the state of which such member was a citizen by the governor thereof, by and with the approval of the senate of such state. Each member of the commission may be removed from office for neglect of duty or misconduct in office by the governor of the state of which such member is a citizen after giving such member a copy of the charges against him and an opportunity of being publicly heard in person or by counsel or both in his own defense, upon not less than ten days' notice . No member of the commission shall receive any compensation for his services as a member, but each member shall be entitled to receive his actual disbursements for his expenses in performing the duties of his office. The commission shall annually choose a president, a vice-president, a treasurer and a secretary from among its members and may also appoint such other officers as it may deem necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of this compact.

"ARTICLE III
"There are hereby transferred to the commission all of the functions, jurisdiction, rights, powers and duties of the respective state boards, as now prescribed by the laws of the respective states, and the same shall hereafter be exercised and performed by the commission, subject to such modifications thereof as are contained in this compact. Either the state of New York or the state of New Jersey may by law applicable to parks or park commissions generally within such state, or by law specifically applicable to the commission or to any of the parks within such state under its jurisdiction , and without the concurrence of the other state, withdraw, modify, alter or amend any of the functions, jurisdiction, rights, powers and duties transferred to the commission by this article or confer additional functions, jurisdiction, rights, powers and duties on the commission, but such action by one state shall be effective only within the territorial limits of such state. The commission shall also have such additional functions, jurisdiction, rights, powers and duties as may be conferred upon it by both states.
"ARTICLE IV
"1. All legal and equitable title to or in any property, tangible or intangible and whether real, personal or mixed, used or held as a part of, in connection with, or for the purposes of the park or parks now under the jurisdiction, management or control of the respective state boards, or connected with the maintenance or control thereof, in so far as the same shall have heretofore been vested in either of such state boards, is hereby transferred to and vested in the commission, subject to such liens, easements, permits, life rights and other contracts relating thereto or in respect thereof as may now lawfully exist. All such legal and equitable title shall, upon the taking effect of this compact, forthwith and thereafter reside in the commission without further act or deed or transfer.
"2. The commission shall succeed and shall be and hereby is substituted for each of the state boards in so far as either of them has
any obligation or liability to any person, firm or corporation, has undertaken or commenced any proceeding or other business, is a party to any action, suit or proceeding (the substitution of the commission for either of the state boards in any action, suit or proceeding to be deemed to be by operation hereof without motion or order ) or has issued or promulgated any orders, rules or regulations, and also in so far as, consistent with the other provisions and the purposes of this compact, the commission should be regarded as succeeding and as substituted for either of the state boards in any other respect in order that the purposes of this compact may be accomplished. The balance of all appropriations heretofore made by either state and remaining to the credit of either of the state boards, to which either state board is entitled , or in the future would become entitled if its
existence continued , shall be deemed to be appropriations to the commission herein created , and the commission shall, upon the taking effect of this compact, succeed to all the rights to any such appropriations theretofore made with the same force and effect as if the commission had originally been specifically named in the respective appropriation acts instead of the respective state boards for which such appropriations were made.
"3. All lands the title to which is hereby transferred to or shall hereafter be owned by the commission shall be and continue under the jurisdiction of the commission and shall be used only for public

park purposes and none of said lands or any part thereof shall be sold, exchanged or conveyed except with the consent of both states by specific enactments ; provided, however, that the commission shall have power to grant easements, licenses, permits and other rights over any lands held by it in either state when in the opinion of the commission the same will not interfere with the use and enjoyment of the park by the public.
"4. Each state may by legislation make rules and regulations for the use and government, including regulation of traffic, of such portions of the park as lie within the boundaries of the state, and such parts of any state, county or other public highways as lie within the limits of such portions of the park, and all lands, parks and parkways in the state under the jurisdiction of the commission, prescribe the penalty or penalties for violation of any such rules or regulations, prescribe the procedure for enforcement of any such penalty or penalties and provide the court or courts in which any such enforcement is to be sought.
"ARTICLE V
"1. All money, securities and other property, real and personal , heretofore received by either of the state boards or hereafter received by the commission by way of gift, bequest or devise, may be retained by the commission and, except in so far as the purpose or manner of using the same is otherwise specifically designated or restricted by the terms of any such gift, bequest or devise, may be used in the commission's discretion in either state for any park purpose ; and the commission may likewise retain and use all revenue and income arising solely from such money, securities and other property so received by way of gift, bequest or devise or from facilities or operations financed solely by funds so received. In the case of revenue and income arising partly from specific property received by way of gift, bequest or devise or from specific facilities or operations financed partly by funds so received, the commission may likewise retain and use such proportion of such revenue and income as the amount of gifts, bequests or devises, or the proceeds thereof, invested in each such property, facility or operation, bears to the total amount invested therein. The legislature of either state may from time to time by law specifically made applicable to the commission prescribe other terms and conditions upon which or purposes for which any gifts, bequests, or devises thereafter made of money, securities, or other property may be accepted for use in such state or used in such state or prescribe a different manner of administering gifts, bequests or devises thereafter made in such state and the disposition of all revenues or income arising therefrom.
"2. Either state may from time to time by law require the commission to render to any designated official or official body of such state such reports and such estimates of revenues and expenditures as may be specified in such law.
"ARTICLE VI
"The commission shall not pledge the credit of either state except by and with the authority of the legislature thereof.
"ARTICLE VII
"Neither the state of New York nor the state of New Jersey shall be liable for any torts of the commission, its members, officers or employees, except as provided by the laws of such state, but each member, officer and employee of the commission shall, with respect to

75TH CONGRESS, 18T SESSION-CH. 706-AUGUST 19, 1937

any tort committed by him in the exercise of his duties or in the course of his employment as such member, officer or employee, be deemed to be an officer or employee of the state where such tort was committed, and any liability arising from such tort shall be governed by the laws of such state.
"ARTICLE VIII

"This compact may be amended from time to time by the concurrent action of the two states who are parties hereto.

JOINT RESOLUTION

Expressing the views of the Congress as to a program for the relief and benefit of agriculture.

anPdrobgernaemfitfoorf raeglrieifculture.
Preamble.

Whereas the whole Nation suffers when agriculture is depressed ; and Whereas the Nation has felt and still feels the unfavorable economic
consequences of two different kinds of misfortune in agriculture ; and

Whereas the first of these misfortunes was the ruinous decline in

farm prices from 1929 to 1932 ; and Whereas the second kind of misfortune was the drought of 1934
followed by the drought of 1936 ; and

Whereas a permanent farm program should (a ) provide not only for soil conservation but also for developing and improving the

crop-adjustment methods ofthe Agricultural Adjustment Act, (b) protect agriculture and consumers against the consequences

of drought, and (c) safeguard farmers and the business of the Nation against the consequences of farm-price decline ; and Whereas it is the sense of Congress that the permanent farm legislation should be based upon the following fundamental principles :
(1) That farmers are entitled to their fair share of the national income ;

(2 ) That consumers should be afforded protection against the consequences of drought, floods, and pestilence causing abnormally high prices by storage of reserve supplies of big crop years for use in time of crop failure ;
(3) That if consumers are given the protection of such an ever-normal granary plan, farmers should be safeguarded against undue price declines by a system of loans supplementing their national soil-conservation program ; and
(4) That control of agricultural surpluses above the evernormal granary supply is necessary to safeguard the Nation's investment in loans and to protect farmers against a price collapse due to bumper yields resulting in production beyond all domestic and foreign need.

(6) That, linked with control of agricultural surpluses, there should be research into new uses for agricultural commodities and the products thereof and search for new uses, new outlets , and new markets, at home and abroad ;

(7) That provision should be made for applications to the Interstate Commerce Commission for correction of discrimina-

tions now existing against agricultural products in the freightrate schedules.

Now, therefore, be it

Whereas the Act entitled " An Act to establish a commission for the
settlement of the special claims comprehended within the terms of the convention between the United States of America and the United Mexican States concluded April 24, 1934", approved April 10, 1935 ( 49 Stat. 149 ) , provides for the establishment of the Special Mexican Claims Commission and confers upon that Commission jurisdiction to hear and determine all claims against the Republic of Mexico, notices of which were filed with the Special Claims Commission , United States and Mexico , established by a convention of September 10, 1923, in which the said Commission failed to award compensation, except such claims as may be found by the committee provided for in the Special Claims Convention of April 24, 1934, to be general claims and recognized as such by the General Claims Commission ; and

Whereas the said Special Claims Convention of April 24, 1934, provides that the jurisdiction in and validity of the claims found by the said committee to be general claims shall be determined in each case when examined and adjudicated by the Commissioners or Umpire in accordance with the provisions of the General Claims Convention of September 8, 1923, and the protocol of April 24, 1934, or the Special Claims Convention of September 10, 1923, and the protocol of June 18, 1932, in the event it shall be found
by the Commissioners or Umpire to have been improperly eliminated from the special claims settlement ; and Whereas certain claims filed with the said Special Claims Commission, United States and Mexico, established by the said convention of September 10, 1923, were found by the said committee to be general claims but have not yet been the subject of any determination by the said General Claims Commission ; and Whereas the said Special Mexican Claims Commission, established in pursuance of the said Act approved April 10, 1935, expires by the terms of the said Act on August 31 , 1937 ; and Whereas, by the terms of the protocol of April 24, 1934, between the United States of America and the United Mexican States, the said General Claims Commission expires on October 24, 1937, and the two Governments have undertaken, upon the basis of the joint report of the members of the said Commission, to conclude a convention for the final disposition of the claims pending before the said Commission , the said convention to take either the form of an agreement for an en-bloc settlement of the said claims or the form of an agreement for the disposition of the claims upon their individual merits by reference to an umpire ; and Whereas the committee provided for in the Special Claims Convention of April 24, 1934, found that the amount to be paid by the Government of Mexico in settlement of the special claims comprehended in that convention was $5,448,020.14, it being understood that the sum thus determined was susceptible of increase after express decision of the General Claims Commission in case the
said Commission might decide to be within the jurisdicton¹ of the Special Commission any one or more of the claims which the said committee found to be general claims ; and Whereas the said Special Mexican Claims Commission, in the event that the total amount of the awards made by it upon all claims is greater than the amount which the Government of Mexico has agreed to pay to the Government of the United States in satisfaction of the claims, is required by the said Act approved April 10, 1935, to reduce the awards on a percentage basis to such amount ; and Whereas, in the circumstances set forth, it is not now possible to ascertain which, if any, of the claims found by the said committee to be general claims will be found by the said General Claims Commission to be special claims, nor what will be the amount of the total en-bloc settlement provided for in the said Special Claims Convention of April 24, 1934 ; and Whereas payments on awards of the said Special Mexican Claims Commission from funds paid to the Government of the United States by the Government of Mexico under the Special Claims Convention of April 24, 1934, should not, in justice to the beneficiaries, be deferred until the question of the jurisdiction of the claims now pending before the General Claims Commission, by virtue of the classification of such claims as general claims by the joint committee, shall have been finally determined in the manner provided for in the said convention of April 24, 1934, or in the said protocol of the same date : Therefore be it
