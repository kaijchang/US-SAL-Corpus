(a) Act relating to the courts of Florida, vol. iii. 752.
The following case, which originated in the courts established by the act of May 23, 1826, contains decisions upon principles of admiralty law, of great general interest.
The schooner North Carolina, bound from Appalachicola to Charleston, with a cargo ofcotton, part on account of the consignees, and part the property of the shipper, struck on a reef about ninety-five miles from Key West; and the next morning one hundred and ten bales of cotton were taken from her by the wrecking schooner Hyder Ally, when she floated, and she sailed with the Hyder Ally to Indian Key, and arrived there the same evening. The Hyder Ally was one of those wrecking schooners in the profits of which Houseman was a participator. He became the consignee of the North Carolina; and salvage being claimed by the master of the Hyder Ally, a reference was made by the master of the North Carolina, and the master of the wrecker, and by an award thirty-five per cent. was allowed as salvage; and one hundred and two bales of cotton were put into the stores of Houseman, in part payment of the salvage ; and one hundred dollars was paid in cash, and a draft for six hundred dollars was given by the captain of the North Carolina, in further satisfaction of the salvage, and the commissions of Houseman, with the vessel's expenses. Afterwards, the consignees of the cotton sent an agent to Key West, who proceeded, by a libel in his name, as agent in the superior court of the United States of Monroe county in Florida, alleging the facts, and by process issued by the court, seventy-two bales of the cotton of the North Carolina were attached in the hands of Houseman. The court decreed that the libellant should recover the seventy-two bales of cotton, and Houseman appealed to the court of appeals. In that court, a supplemental libel was filed by the appellee, claiming damages for the taking and the detention of fifty other bales of cotton, making the whole number of one hundred and twentytwo bales, which had gone into the possession of Houseman. The court of appeals gave a decree in favour of the appellee for the value of one hundred and twenty-two bales. The Supreme Court affirmed the decree as to the seventy-two bales, and set aside that part of the decree which allowed the value of the fifty bales; leaving the consignees or owners of the fifty bales to proceed in the superior court of East Florida by a new libel for the recovery of the same or the value thereof. Houseman v. The Schooner North Carolina, 15 Peters, 41.
There are many cases in which the contract of the captain, in relation to the amount of salvage to be paid to the salvors, or his agreement to refer the question to arbitrators, would bind the owners. In times of disaster, it is always his duty to exercise his best judgment, and to use his best exertions for the benefit of both the vessel and cargo: and when, from his situation, he is unable to consult them or their agent, without an inconvenient and injurious delay, it is in his power to compromise a question of salvage and he is not bound in all cases to wait for the decision of a court of admiralty. Ibid.
So, too, when the salvage service has not been important, and the compensation demanded is a small one, it may often be the interest of the owners, that the amount should be settled at once by the captain and the vessel proceed on her voyage, without waiting even a day for the purpose of consulting them.
But in all such cases, unless the acts of the captain are ratified by the owners, his conduct will be carefully watched and scrutinized by the court; and his contracts will not be regarded as binding on the parties concerned, unless they appear to have been bona fide, and such as a discreet owner, placed in the same circumstances, would probably have made. If he settles the amount by agreement, those who claim under it must show that the salvage allowed was reasonable and just. If he refers it to arbitrators those who claim the benefit of the award, must show that the proceedings were fair, and the referees worthy of the trust. Ibid.
The case is within the jurisdiction of a court of admiralty. It is a question of salvage of a vessel which had been stranded on a reef in the ocean. The points in controversy are whether salvage is due and if due, how much. The admiralty is the only court in which such a question can be tried. Ibid.
It is well settled in admiralty proceedings, that the agent of absent owners may libel either in his
own name, as agent, or in the name of his principals, as he thinks best. That a power of attorneygiven subsequent to the libel is a sufficient ratification of what he had before done in their behalf and that the consignees of a cargo have a sufficient interest in the cargo that they may proceed in the admiralty for the recovery not only of their own property, but for that part of it which may be consigned to them.

It is not a contempt of court to serve a person with a summons, while attending at the place where the court is held, as a party in a cause, or as a witness. It is a contempt of court to serve process, either of summons or capias, in the actual or constructive presence of the court. Blight's Ex'rs v. Ashley, 1 Peters' C. C. R. 41.
Attachments for the non-attendance of a witness, on a subpoena, must be served by the marshal of the court; although the persons against whom the process is issued, reside in a distant county. United States v. Montgomery, circuit court of the United States, 2 Dall. 33.
An attachment is the usual process to bring a party into court, where he has not made a true return : and if he is present in court, no such process is necessary; but the court may pass an order directing him, immediately, to answer interrogatories. United States v. Greene, 3 Mason's C. C. R. 482.
Attachments may issue out of the admiralty courts of the United States, against the goods or debts of an absent person, so as to make him a party to the suit. Bouysson et al. v. Miller et al., Bee's Adm. Decis. 186.
The admiralty may issue process of attachment to compel an appearance in cases of maritime torts, as well as in cases of contract. Manro v. Almeida, 10 Wheat. 473; 6 Cond. Rep. 190.
An admiralty court has jurisdiction to proceed by attachment in rem for a tort. The Candalero, Bee's Adm. Decis. 60.
The process of attachment may issue whenever the defendant has concealed himself, or has absconded from the country, and the goods to be attached are within the jurisdiction of the court of admiralty. It may issue against his goods and chattels, and against his credits and effects, in the hands of third persons. Manro v. Almeida, 10 Wheat. 473; 6 Cond. Rep. 190.
It seems that an attachment cannot issue without an express order of the judge, but it may be issued simultaneously with the monition ; and where the attachment issued in this manner, and in pursuance of the prayer of the libel, the Supreme Court will presume that it was regularly issued. Ibid.
The act for regulating processes in the courts of the United States, provides that the forms and modes of proceeding in courts of equity, and in those of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, shall be according to the principles, rules and usages which belong to courts of equity, and to courts of admiralty, respectively, as contradistinguished from courts of common law, subject, however, to alterations by the courts, &c. This act has been generally understood to adopt the principles, rules and usages of the court of chancery of England. Hinde v. Vattier. 5 Peters, 398.
Process of foreign attachment cannot be properly issued by the circuit courts of the United States, in cases where the defendant is domiciled abroad, or not found within the district in which the process issues, so that it cannot be served upon him. Toland v. Sprague, 12 Peters, 300.
By the general provisions of the laws of the United States: 1. The circuit courts can issue no process beyond the limits of their districts. 2. Independently of positive legislation, the process can only be served upon persons within the same districts. 3. The acts of Congress adopting the state process, adopt the form and modes of service only, so far as the persons are rightfully within the reach of such process; and did not intend to enlarge the sphere of the jurisdiction of the circuit courts. 4. The right to attach property to compel the appearance of persons, can properly be used only in cases in which such persons are amenable to the process of the circuit court, in personam; that is, where they are inhabitants, or found within the United States; and not where they are aliens, or citizens resident abroad, at the commencement of the suit, and have no inhabitancy here. Ibid.
In the case of a person being amenable to process, in personam, an attachment against his property cannot be issued against him, except as a part of, or together with process to be served upon his person. Ibid.
The circuit and district courts of the United States cannot, either in suits at common law or equity, send their process into another district, except where specially authorized so to do, by some act of Congress. Ex parte Graham, 3 Wash. C. C. R. 456.
The marshal may have an attachment to enforce the payment of his fees of office, against suitors in the court. Anonymous, 2 Gallis. C. C. R. 101.
The court will not dictate to the marshal, what return he shall make to process in his hands. He must make his return at his peril, and any person injured by it, may have his legal remedy for such return. Wortman v. Conyngham, Peters' C. C. R. 241.
Congress has, by the constitution, exclusive authority to regulate proceedings in the courts of the United States ; and the states have no authority to control those proceedings ; except so far as the state process acts are adopted by Congress, or by the courts of the United States, under the authority of Congress. Wayman v. Southard, 10 Wheat. 1 ; 6 Cond. Rep. 1.
The 14th section of the judiciary act of 1789, ch. 20, authorizes the courts of the United States to issue writs of execution, as well as other writs. Ibid.
The 34th section of the judiciary act of 1789, ch. 20, does not apply to the process and practice of the courts. It merely furnishes a rule of decision, and is not intended to regulate the remedy. Ibid.
The process act of 1792, ch. 137, is the law which regulates executions issuing from the courts of the United States : and it adopts the practice of the supreme courts of the states, in 1789, as the rule for governing proceedings on such executions, subject to such alterations as the courts of the United States may make, but not subject to the alterations which have since taken place in the state laws and practice. Ibid.
The statutes of Kentucky concerning executions, which require the plaintiff to endorse on the execution, that bank notes of the Bank of Kentucky, or notes of the Bank of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, will be received in payment, and on his refusal, authorize the defendant to give a replevin bond for the debt, payable in two years, are not applicable to executions issued on judgments rendered by the courts of the United States.

The laws of the United States authorize the courts of the Union so to alter the form of the process of execution used in the supreme courts of the states in 1789, as to subject to execution, issuing out of the federal courts, lands and other property not thus subject by the state laws in force at that time. Bank of the United States v. Halstead, 10 Wheat. 51; 6 Cond. Rep. 22.
A subpoena duces tecum may issue to the President of the United States. 1 Burr's Trial, 183. A party cannot be arrested in Pennsylvania, on an attachment from the circuit court in Rhode Island, for contempt, in not appearing in that court after a monition served upon him in Pennsylvania, to answer in a prize cause depending in the court in Rhode Island. Ex parte Graham, 3 Wash. C. C. R. 456. A writ of error does not lie to an order of the court below to stay the proceedings finally, upon suggestion of the attorney of the United States, in a case to which the United States are not parties; but the court will award a mandamus nisi, in the nature of a procedendo. Livingston v. Dorgenois, 7 Cranch,
577; 2 Cond. Rep. 618. The marshal of the District of Columbia is bound to serve a subpoena in chancery, as soon as he rea-
sonably can; and he will, in case of neglect, be answerable to the plaintiff, who has, in consequence of such neglect, sustained any loss. Kennedy v. Brent, 6 Cranch, 187; 2 Cond. Rep. 345.
On a capias, in assumpsit against three, and one arrested, who gives bail, and non est inventus as to the others, if the party files his declaration and proceeds against the one arrested, he cannot afterwards bring in the others by alias capias, and make them parties to the suit. United States v. Parker, 2
Dall. 373. An alias capias must be tested, as of the term to which the original writ was returned. Ibid. A term cannot intervene between the teste and return of a writ of error. Hamilton v. Moore, 3 Dall.
371; 1 Cond. Rep. 168. If the defendant below intermarries after the judgment, and before the service of the writ of error,
the service of the citation upon the husband will be sufficient. Fairfax's Ex'rs v. Fairfax, 5 Cranch,
19; 2 Cond. Rep. 178. There is no act of Congress which authorizes a circuit court to issue a compulsory process to the
district court for the removal of a cause from that jurisdiction before a final judgment or decree is pronounced. If a certiorari should issue in such a case, the district court may and ought to refuse obedience to the writ: and after the cause is thus removed, either party may move for a procedendo, or pursue the cause in the district court, in like manner as if the record had not been removed. But, if instead of taking advantage of this irregularity, the defendant enter his appearance in the circuit court, take defence and plead to issue, it is too late after verdict to object to the irregularity. The cause will be considered as an original one in the circuit court, made so by consent of parties, even though no declaration de novo should be filed in the circuit court. Patterson v. The United States, 2 Wheat. 221 ;
4 Cond. Rep. 98. Whenever, by the state laws in force in 1789, a capias might issue from a state court, the acts of 1789
and 1792, extending, in terms, to that species of writ, must be understood to have adopted its use permanently in the federal courts. United States v. January, 10 Wheat. 66. In a note.
At an early period after the organization of the federal courts, the rules of practice in force in the state courts, which were similar to the English practice, were adopted by the judges of the circuit court. A subsequent change in the practice of the state courts, will not authorize a departure from the rules adopted in the circuit court. Anonymous, Peters' C. C. R. 1.
Whenever, by the laws of the United States, a defendant is to be arrested, the process of arrest employed in the state, shall be pursued. 2 Burr's Trial, 481.
Upon executing a writ of inquiry, in Virginia, in an action of assumpsit upon a promissory note, it is necessary to produce a note, corresponding with that stated in the declaration ; but it is not necessary to prove the note. Sheehy v. Mandeville, 7 Cranch, 208; 2 Cond. Rep. 476.
A party charged with a crime, even before indictment found, may have compulsory process for his witnesses. But his omitting to avail himself of this right is not such negligence as will deprive him of the benefit of having his cause postponed, if his witnesses be absent; but it will justify the court in imposing terms on him. United States v. Moore, Wallace's C. C. R. 23.
The process act of Congress, of 1828, was passed shortly after the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, in the case of Wayman v. Southard, and the Bank of the United States v. Halsted, and was intended as a legislative sanction of the opinions of the court in those cases. The power given to the courts of the United States, by this act, to make rules and regulations on final process, so as to conform the same to the laws of the states on the same subject, extends to future legislation ; and as well to the modes of proceedings on executions, as to the forms of writs. Ross & King v. Duval et al., 13
Peters, 45. All proceedings for attachments are on the civil side of the courts, and are to be entitled with the
names of the parties, until an attachment issues; after which they are on the criminal side. United States v. Wayne, Wallace's C. C. R. 134.
The courts of chancery of the United States will, under circumstances, order a commission of rebel-
lion, to be returnable forthwith. Ibid. The judiciary act of 1789, ch. 20, does not contemplate compulsive process against any person in any
district, unless he be an inhabitant of, or found within, the same district at the time of serving the writ. Picquet v. Swan, 5 Mason's C. C. R. 35.
The act of Massachusetts of 1797, ch. 50, prescribing the modes ofserving process,does not apply to a case where the defendant has been an inhabitant, but at the time of the suit brought has his actual domi-
cil in another state or country. Ibid. Under the statute of Massachusetts of 1823, ch. 142, giving relief against fraud to secure attaching
creditors, it is not necessary that the second attachment should be returnable to the same term of the

Sec . 2. And be it further enacted, That, in any one of the United States, where judgments are a lien upon the property of the defendant, and where, by the laws of such state, defendants are entitled in the courts thereof, to an imparlance of one term or more, defendants, in actions in the courts of the United States, holden in such state, shall be entitled to an imparlance of one term.
Sec . 3. And be it further enacted, That writs of execution and other final process issued on judgments and decrees, rendered in any of the courts of the United States, and the proceedings thereupon shall be the same, except their style, in each state, respectively, as are now used in the courts of such state, saving to the courts of the United States in those states, in which there are not courts of equity, with the ordinary equity jurisdiction, the power of prescribing the mode of executing their decrees in equity by rules of court: Provided, however, That it shall be in the power of the courts, if they see fit in their discretion, by rules of court, so far to alter final process in said courts as to conform the same to any change which may be adopted by the legislatures of the respective states for the state courts.

C. R. 622.

Laws which relate to practice, process, or modes of proceeding before or after judgment, are excep-

tions to the 34th section of the judiciary act of 1789, as Congress have legislated on the subject. The

Supreme Court of the United States have established the distinction to be this : State laws, which fur-

nish the court a rule for forming a judgment, are binding on the federal courts, not laws for carrying

that judgment into execution ; that is governed by the acts of Congress, and the rules of practice adopt-

ed in pursuance thereto. Thompson v. Phillips, Baldwin's C. C. R. 274.

The act of the legislature of Ohio, of February, 1820, relative to proceedings against parties to pro-

missory notes, by which all the parties to a note might be proceeded against in one suit, was a very wise

and benevolent law, and its salutary effects produced its immediate adoption into the practice of the

courts of the United States, and the suits have, in many instances, been prosecuted under it. Fullerton

v. The Bank of the United States, 1 Peters, 604.

Although the act of the legislature of Ohio, regulating the mode of proceeding in actions on promis-

sory notes, was passed after the making of the note upon which this action was brought, yet the circuit

court of the United States for the district of Ohio, having incorporated the action under that statute,

with all its incidents, into its course of practice, and having full power by law to adopt it, there does

not appear any legal objection to its doing so, in the prosecution of the system under which it has always

acted. Yeaton v. Lenox, 8 Peters, 123.

The process act of 1828 expressly adopts the mesne process, and modes of proceeding in suits at com-

mon law, then existing in the highest state court, under the state laws; which of course included all the

regulations of the state laws as to bail, and exemptions of the party from arrest and imprisonment. In

regard, also, to writs of execution, and other final process, and " the proceedings thereupon;" it adopts

an equally comprehensive language, and declares they shall be the same as were then used in the courts of the state. Beers v. Haughton, 9 Peters, 329.

The circuit court of each district, sit within and for that district, and are bounded by its local limits.

Whatever may be the extent of the jurisdiction of the circuit court over the subject matter of suits, in

respect to persons and property, it can only be exercised within the limits of the district. Congress

might have authorized civil process from any circuit court to have run into any state of the Union. It

has not done so. It has not, in terms, authorized any civil process to run into any other district; with

the single exception of subpoenas to witnesses within a limited distance. In regard to final process,

there are two cases, and only two, in which writs of execution can now by law be served in any other

district than that in which the judgment was rendered; one in favour of private persons in another dis-

trict of the same state; and the other in favour of the United States, in any part of the United States. Toland v. Sprague, 12 Peters, 300.

(a) Act relating to the courts of Florida, vol. iii. 752.
The following case, which originated in the courts established by the act of May 23, 1826, contains decisions upon principles of admiralty law, of great general interest.
The schooner North Carolina, bound from Appalachicola to Charleston, with a cargo ofcotton, part on account of the consignees, and part the property of the shipper, struck on a reef about ninety-five miles from Key West; and the next morning one hundred and ten bales of cotton were taken from her by the wrecking schooner Hyder Ally, when she floated, and she sailed with the Hyder Ally to Indian Key, and arrived there the same evening. The Hyder Ally was one of those wrecking schooners in the profits of which Houseman was a participator. He became the consignee of the North Carolina; and salvage being claimed by the master of the Hyder Ally, a reference was made by the master of the North Carolina, and the master of the wrecker, and by an award thirty-five per cent. was allowed as salvage; and one hundred and two bales of cotton were put into the stores of Houseman, in part payment of the salvage ; and one hundred dollars was paid in cash, and a draft for six hundred dollars was given by the captain of the North Carolina, in further satisfaction of the salvage, and the commissions of Houseman, with the vessel's expenses. Afterwards, the consignees of the cotton sent an agent to Key West, who proceeded, by a libel in his name, as agent in the superior court of the United States of Monroe county in Florida, alleging the facts, and by process issued by the court, seventy-two bales of the cotton of the North Carolina were attached in the hands of Houseman. The court decreed that the libellant should recover the seventy-two bales of cotton, and Houseman appealed to the court of appeals. In that court, a supplemental libel was filed by the appellee, claiming damages for the taking and the detention of fifty other bales of cotton, making the whole number of one hundred and twentytwo bales, which had gone into the possession of Houseman. The court of appeals gave a decree in favour of the appellee for the value of one hundred and twenty-two bales. The Supreme Court affirmed the decree as to the seventy-two bales, and set aside that part of the decree which allowed the value of the fifty bales; leaving the consignees or owners of the fifty bales to proceed in the superior court of East Florida by a new libel for the recovery of the same or the value thereof. Houseman v. The Schooner North Carolina, 15 Peters, 41.
There are many cases in which the contract of the captain, in relation to the amount of salvage to be paid to the salvors, or his agreement to refer the question to arbitrators, would bind the owners. In times of disaster, it is always his duty to exercise his best judgment, and to use his best exertions for the benefit of both the vessel and cargo: and when, from his situation, he is unable to consult them or their agent, without an inconvenient and injurious delay, it is in his power to compromise a question of salvage and he is not bound in all cases to wait for the decision of a court of admiralty. Ibid.
So, too, when the salvage service has not been important, and the compensation demanded is a small one, it may often be the interest of the owners, that the amount should be settled at once by the captain and the vessel proceed on her voyage, without waiting even a day for the purpose of consulting them.
But in all such cases, unless the acts of the captain are ratified by the owners, his conduct will be carefully watched and scrutinized by the court; and his contracts will not be regarded as binding on the parties concerned, unless they appear to have been bona fide, and such as a discreet owner, placed in the same circumstances, would probably have made. If he settles the amount by agreement, those who claim under it must show that the salvage allowed was reasonable and just. If he refers it to arbitrators those who claim the benefit of the award, must show that the proceedings were fair, and the referees worthy of the trust. Ibid.
The case is within the jurisdiction of a court of admiralty. It is a question of salvage of a vessel which had been stranded on a reef in the ocean. The points in controversy are whether salvage is due and if due, how much. The admiralty is the only court in which such a question can be tried. Ibid.
It is well settled in admiralty proceedings, that the agent of absent owners may libel either in his
own name, as agent, or in the name of his principals, as he thinks best. That a power of attorneygiven subsequent to the libel is a sufficient ratification of what he had before done in their behalf and that the consignees of a cargo have a sufficient interest in the cargo that they may proceed in the admiralty for the recovery not only of their own property, but for that part of it which may be consigned to them.

Be it therefore enacted by the General Assembly of this Commonwealth, That the assent of this legislature in and to the amendments to the " Act incorporating the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company," as contained in the foregoing act of the General Assembly of Maryland, is hereby as fully and completely given, as if the said amendatory act had been passed by this present General Assembly.

ACT OF THE STATE OF MARYLAND.

A further supplement to the act, entitled " An act for the promotion of internal improvement."

Whereas by the act, entitled " A supplement to the act, entitled an act for

the promotion of internal Improvement," passed at December session, eighteen

hundred and twenty-six, chapter two hundred and twenty-one, it is, amongst

other things, provided, that one of the conditions upon which the treasurer of

the Western Shore shall be authorized to subscribe for five thousand shares in

the capital stock of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company, is, that when-

ever the United States shall have authorized subscriptions for not less than ten

thousand shares of the capital stock of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Com-

pany ; and whereas it is important, with reference to the interest of the state,

that the grant already made by her, to that company, should be made dependent

upon such other conditions and restrictions, as will effectually secure the com-

pletion of this work, if ever commenced, and the previous payment of the in-

stalments upon all other subscriptions; and that some mode of payment of

the subscription already made, should be provided, having reference to the ex-

hausted condition of the treasury, in lieu of the mode of payment provided by

the terms of the original subscription: Therefore,

Sec . 1. Be it enacted by the General Assembly of Maryland, That the trea-

surer of the Western Shore be authorized to subscribe the aforementioned five

thousand shares of the capital stock of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Com-

pany, whenever the commissioners, their successors, or a majority of them,

appointed on the part of this state, to aid in opening books, and taking sub-

scriptions to the stock of said company, shall certify that the sum of two mil-

lions five hundred thousand dollars has been subscribed by bona fide sub-

scribers, with such additional securities as to them may be deemed ample, to

ensure the faithful compliance on the part of the subscribers of the aforesaid

two millions five hundred thousand dollars: and provided, also, that the in-

stalments thereon, similar to that required to be paid on behalf of the state, and

all the previous instalments, which may have accrued thereon, shall have been

paid, before any payment shall be demanded on account of the state's sub-

scription.

Sec . 2. And be it enacted, That the said subscription is authorized and

directed upon the condition, that the said president and directors of the said

Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company, shall certify to the said treasurer, their

agreement, under the corporate seal of said company, to accept and receive, in

payment of the instalments which may become due on any such subscription,

as they may be called for, certificates of stock of the state of Maryland, at par,

irredeemable for fifteen years, and bearing an interest of five per centum per

annum, payable quarterly, to commence at the end of one year after the same

shall have been issued in succession, and that, upon any such subscription

being made, the said Treasurer is further authorized and directed to borrow, on

the credit of the state, on the best obtainable terms, from time to time, the funds

necessary to meet and discharge the first advance, and each successive pay-

ment, whensoever and as often as any instalment on the said subscription of the

state shall be demanded, and become due, in conformity to the provisions of

the charter of the said company; and to issue for the same, certificates of stock

of the state, bearing interest at the rate of five per centum per annum, payable

quarterly : provided, that the said stock shall be redeemable at the pleasure of

the state, at any time after fifty years from each successive issue of certificates

as aforesaid; and the premium, if any, on each and every of the said loans,

shall be invested in some safe and productive stock, at the discretion of the

said treasurer, with the advice and consent of the governor and council, for the

time being; and the interests, dividends or profits, arising from such invest-

demption of the said loans; and the said funds, when obtained under the authority of this act, the said treasurer is hereby directed to pay to the order of
the president and directors of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company, in conformity to the provisions of the charter of the said company, and to receive therefor the necessary acquittances ; or, in case it shall be deemed more beneficial to the interest of the state, in the estimation of the said treasurer, with the approbation and concurrence of the governor and council, the said treasurer shall be, and he hereby is, authorized and directed, whensoever and as often as any instalment on the said subscription of the state shall be demanded, and become due, in conformity to the provisions of the said charter, to issue certificates of stock of the state, at par, irredeemable for fifteen years, bearing interest at the rate of five per centum per annum ; the said interest upon such certificates, to commence at the end of one year after the same shall have been issued, in succession, and to be paid quarterly thereafter; and the said treasurer is authorized and directed to cause the said certificates to be delivered to the person or persons authorized to receive the said instalments, as they shall severally become due, and to demand and receive, from such person or persons, upon the delivery of the said certificates, a full acquittance and discharge for and on behalf of the state, for the instalment for which the said certificates were issued: provided, always, that, in case a premium of five per centum, or exceeding five per centum, may be obtained upon any loan required for any instalment as aforesaid, that then, and in that case, it shall be the duty of the said treasurer, with the advice and consent of the governor and council, as aforesaid, to elect the first alternative, as hereinbefore provided : And provided furthermore, and it is hereby enacted, That, upon the adoption of either alternative, a capital equal to ten per centum, at the least, on the gross amount of each loan, shall be made from any unappropriated money in the treasury, and the same shall be invested in some safe and productive stock, as aforesaid ; and the interest, dividends, or profits, arising therefrom, shall be reinvested, as aforesaid, for the eventual redemption of each of the said loans, to be negotiated for as aforesaid.
Sec . 3. And be it enacted, That any act or acts, repugnant to, or inconsistent herewith, be, and the same are hereby, repealed.
We hereby certify the aforegoing to be a true copy from the original act, which passed both branches of the legislature of Maryland at their December session, eighteen hundred and twenty-seven.

AN ACT OF THE STATE OF VIRGINIA.
An Act giving the assent of this state to an act further to amend the act incorporating the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company, passed by the state of Maryland. \Passed Feb. 26, 1828.]
Whereas it is represented that the General Assembly of the commonwealth of Maryland hath passed, at their present session, an act entitled " An act further to amend the act incorporating the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company," in the words following, to wit:
" Whereas it is represented to this General Assembly, that it may tend greatly to the promotion of the object of the original act incorporating the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company, to authorize a subscription for its stock by aliens; and doubts have arisen, whether, under said act, such stock may be held by others than citizens of the United States; and whether the stock of said company is to be regarded as real or personal property : --
1. "Be it enacted by the General Assembly of Maryland, That it shall and
may be lawful for the commissioners for the time being, and for the president and directors of the said company, whensoever the same shall be duly organized, agreeably to the provisions of the original act aforesaid, to receive subscriptions for any number of shares of the capital stock of said company, from any alien or aliens, who are hereby declared competent to hold the same; and, if in their judgment it be necessary, to appoint an agent or agents to
visit Europe for that purpose. 2. "And be it enacted, That the shares of the capital stock of the said Che-
sapeake and Ohio Canal Company, shall be deemed and taken to be personal estate, and as such to be liable to be assigned and transferred : Provided, That it shall not be lawful for any stockholder in said company to assign any share or shares, by him or her held, unless it be in person, or by attorney, upon the books of said company: And provided, also, That no transfer or assignment shall be made, except for one or more whole share or shares, and not for any part of such share or shares ; and that no share or shares shall at any time be assigned or transferred, or held in trust for the use and benefit, or in the name of another, whereby the said president and directors, or stockholders, of the said company, or any of them, shall or may be challenged or made to answer concerning any such trust; but that every person appearing as aforesaid to be stockholders, shall, as to others of the said company, be, to every intent, taken absolutely as such; but as between any trustee, and the person for whose benefit any trust shall be created, the common remedy may be pursued.
3. " And be it enacted, That the words ` nor any payment demanded within any year from the commencement of the work,' inserted in the proviso to the fifth section of the original act incorporating the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company, passed the twenty-seventh day of January, eighteen hundred and twenty-four, by the General Assembly of Virginia, and subsequently confirmed by the General Assembly of Maryland, be, and the same are hereby repealed and expunged from the aforesaid proviso; and henceforth the said proviso shall, be construed in the same manner, and have the same effect, as if the afore-recited words had never been recited therein.
4. " And be it enacted, That this act shall commence and be in force as soon as it shall have received the assent of the legislature of Virginia, of the Congress of the United States, of the Potowmac Company, and of the stockholders of the said Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company, to be given at their first general meeting after the passage of this act."

the capital stock of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company, is, that when-

And whereas, satisfactory evidence has lately been received by me, from His Royal Highness the Grand Duke of Oldenburg, through an official communication of F. A. Mench, his Consul in the United States, under date of the 15th September, 1830, that no discriminating duties of tonnage or impost are imposed or levied in the ports of the Grand Dukedom of Oldenburg, upon vessels wholly belonging to citizens of the United States, or upon the produce, manufactures, or merchandise, imported in the same from the United States, or from any other country.
Now, therefore, I, Andrew Jackson, President of the United States of America, do hereby declare and proclaim that, so much of the several acts imposing discriminating duties of tonnage and impost within the United States, are, and shall be, suspended and discontinued, so far as respects the vessels of the Grand Dukedom of Oldenburg, and the produce, manufactures, and merchandise, imported into the United States in the same, from the Grand Dukedom of Oldenburg, and from any other foreign country whatever; the said suspension to take effect from the day above mentioned, and to continue thenceforward so long as the reciprocal exemption of the vessels of the United States, and the produce, manufactures, and merchandise, imported into the Grand Dukedom of Oldenburg in the same as aforesaid, shall be continued on the part of the government of His Royal Highness the Grand Duke of Oldenburg.

continued, and no longer. And whereas, satisfactory evidence has been received by me, from His Bri-
tannic Majesty, as King of Hanover, through the Right Honourable Charles Richard Vaughan, his Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary, that

vessels wholly belonging to citizens of the United States, or merchandise, the

produce or manufacture thereof, imported in such vessels, are not, nor shall be, on their entering any Hanoverian port, subject to the payment of higher duties

of tonnage or impost, than are levied on Hanoverian ships, or merchandise, the

produce or manufacture of the United States, imported in such vessels.

Now, therefore, I, John Quincy Adams, President of the United States of America, do hereby declare and proclaim, that so much of the several acts imposing duties on the tonnage of ships and vessels, and on goods, wares and merchandise, imported into the United States as imposed a discriminating duty

of tonnage, between the vessels of the Kingdom of Hanover, and vessels of

the United States, between goods imported into the United States, in vessels of the Kingdom of Hanover, and vessels of the United States, are suspended

and discontinued, so far as the same respect the produce or manufacture of the said Kingdom of Hanover ; the said suspension to take effect this day, and

to continue henceforward so long as the reciprocal exemption of the vessels of

the United States and the merchandise laden therein as aforesaid shall be continued in the ports of the Kingdom of Hanover.

Discriminating duties suspended upon Austrian vessels.
* This should be " third," in-

Whereas, by an act of the Congress of the United States, of the seventh of January, one thousand eight hundred and twenty-four, entitled " An Act concerning discriminating duties of Tonnage and Impost," it is provided, that

upon satisfactory evidence being given to the President of the United States by the government of any foreign nation, that no discriminating duties of ton-

nage or impost are imposed or levied within the ports of the said nation, upon

vessels belonging wholly to citizens of the United States, or upon merchandise, the produce or manufacture thereof, imported in the same, the President

is thereby authorized to issue his proclamation, declaring that the foreign dis-

criminating duties and impost within the United States are, and shall be, suspended and discontinued, so far as respects the vessels of the said nation, and the merchandise of its produce or manufacture, imported into the United States

in the same ; the said suspension to take effect from the time of such notification being given to the President of the United States, and to continue so long as the reciprocal exemption of vessels belonging to citizens of the United

States, and merchandise, as aforesaid, therein laden, shall be continued, and

no longer.

And whereas, satisfactory evidence has been received by me from His Imperial Majesty, the Emperor of Austria, through the Baron de Lederer, his

Consul General in the United States, that vessels wholly belonging to citizens of the United States are not, nor shall be, on their entering any Austrian port,

from and after the first day of January last, subject to the payment of higher duties of tonnage than are levied on Austrian ships.

Now, therefore, I, Andrew Jackson, President of the United States of Ame-

rica, do hereby declare and proclaim, that so much of the several acts imposing duties on the tonnage of ships arriving in the United States, as imposed a dis-

criminating duty between the vessels of the Empire of Austria and vessels of the United States, are suspended and discontinued ; the said suspension to take

effect from the day above mentioned, and to continue henceforward, so long as

the reciprocal exemption of the vessels of the United States shall be continued in the ports of the imperial dominions of Austria.

ARTICLES OF A CONVENTION,

Concluded at the City of Washington this sixth day of May, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and twentyeight, between James Barbour, Secretary of War, being especially authorized therefor by the President of the United States, and the undersigned, Chiefs and Head Men of the Cherokee Nation of Indians, West of the Mississippi, they being duly
authorized and empowered by their Nation.

May 6, 1828. Proclamation, May 28, 1828.

Where as , it being the anxious desire of the Government of the United States to secure to the Cherokee nation of Indians, as well those
now living within the limits of the Territory of Arkansas, as those of their friends and brothers who reside in States East of the Mississippi,
and who may wish to join their brothers of the West, a permanent
home, and which shall, under the most solemn guarantee of the United States, be, and remain, theirs forever -- a home that shall never, in all future time, be embarrassed by having extended around it the lines, or
placed over it the jurisdiction of a Territory or State, nor be pressed upon by the extension, in any way, of any of the limits of any existing Territory or State; and, Whereas, the present location of the Chero-
kees in Arkansas being unfavourable to their present repose, and tending, as the past demonstrates, to their future degradation and misery; and the Cherokees being anxious to avoid such consequences, and yet not questioning their right to their lands in Arkansas, as secured to them by Treaty, and resting also upon the pledges given them by the President of the United States, and the Secretary of War, of March,
1818, and 8th October, 1821, in regard to the outlet to the West, and as may be seen on referring to the records of the War Department, still
being anxious to secure a permanent home, and to free themselves, and
their posterity, from an embarrassing connexion with the Territory of Arkansas, and guard themselves from such connexions in future; and,
Whereas, it being important, not to the Cherokees only, but also to the
Choctaws, and in regard also to the question which may be agitated in the future respecting the location of the latter, as well as the former, within the limits of the Territory or State of Arkansas, as the case may be, and their removal therefrom; and to avoid the cost which may attend negotiations to rid the Territory or State of Arkansas whenever it may
become a State, of either, or both of those Tribes, the parties hereto do hereby conclude the following Articles, viz :

Object of the treaty.

Art . 1. The Western boundary of Arkansas shall be, and the same is, hereby defined, viz : A line shall be run, commencing on Red River, at the point where the Eastern Choctaw line strikes said River, and run due North with said line to the River Arkansas, thence in a direct line to the South West corner of Missouri.
Art . 2. The United States agree to possess the Cherokees, and to guarantee it to them forever, and that guarantee is hereby solemnly pledged, of seven millions of acres of land, to be bounded as follows, viz: Commencing at that point on Arkansas River where the Eastern Choctaw boundary line strikes said River, and running thence with the Western line of Arkansas, as defined in the foregoing article, to the
(311)

Western boon, dary of Arkansas defined.
Territory guarantied to Cherokees by U. S.

U.S. to run the lines.

South-West corner of Missouri, and thence with the Western boundary line of Missouri till it crosses the waters of Neasho, generally called Grand River, thence due West to a point from which a due South course will strike the present North West corner of Arkansas Territory, thence continuing due South, on and with the present Western boundary line of the Territory to the main branch of Arkansas River, thence down said River to its junction with the Canadian River, and thence up and between the said Rivers Arkansas and Canadian, to a point at which a line running North and South from River to River, will give the aforesaid seven millions of acres. In addition to the seven millions of acres thus provided for, and bounded, the United States further guarantee to the Cherokee Nation a perpetual outlet, West, and a free and unmolested use of all the Country lying West of the Western boundary of the above described limits, and as far West as the sovereignty of the United States, and their right of soil extend.
Art . 3. The United States agree to. have the lines of the above cession run without delay, say not later than the first of October next, and to remove, immediately after the running of the Eastern line from the Arkansas River to the South-West corner of Missouri, all white persons from the West to the East of said line, and also all others, should there be any there, who may be unacceptable to the Cherokees, so that no obstacles arising out of the presence of a white population, or a population of any other sort, shall exist to annoy the Cherokees -- and also to keep all such from the West of said line in future.

Persons to be appointed to value Cherokee improvements.

Art . 4. The United States moreover agree to appoint suitable persons whose duty it shall be, in conjunction with the Agent, to value all such improvements as the Cherokees may abandon in their removal
from their present homes to the District of Country as ceded in the second Article of this agreement, and to pay for the same immediately
after the assessment is made, and the amount ascertained. It is further agreed, that the property and improvements connected with the agency,
shall be sold under the direction of the Agent, and the proceeds of the same applied to aid in the erection, in the country to which the Chero-
kees are going, of a Grist, and Saw Mill, for their use. The aforesaid property and improvements are thus defined : Commence at the Arkansas
River opposite William Stinnetts, and run due North one mile, thence due East to a point from which a due South line to the Arkansas River would include the Chalybeate, or Mineral Spring, attached to or near
the present residence of the Agent, and thence up said River (Arkansas) to the place of beginning.

Further agreement.

Art . 5. It is further agreed, that the United States, in consideration of the inconvenience and trouble attending the removal, and on account'
of the reduced value of a great portion of the lands herein ceded to the Cherokees, as compared with that of those in Arkansas which were
made theirs by the Treaty of 1817, and Convention of 1819, will pay to the Cherokees, immediately after their removal which shall be within fourteen months of the date of this agreement, the sum of fifty thousand dollars; also an annuity, for three years, of two thousand
dollars, towards defraying the cost and trouble which may attend upon going after and recovering their stock wdiich may stray into the Terri-
tory in quest of the pastures from which they may be driven -- also, eight thousand seven hundred and sixty dollars, for spoliations com-
mitted on them, (the Cherokees,) which sum will be in full of all demands of the kind up to this date, as well those against the Osages, as those against citizens of the United States -- this being the amount of the claims for said spoliations, as rendered by the Cherokees, and which are believed to be correctly and fairly stated.--Also, one thou-

It is agreed further, that the expense incurred other than that paid by the United States in the erection of the buildings and improvements, so far as that may have been paid by the benevolent society who have been, and yet are, engaged in instructing the Cherokee children, shall be paid to the society, it being the understanding that the amount shall be expended in the erection of other buildings and improvements, for like purposes, in the country herein ceded to the Cherokees. The United States relinquish their claim due by the Cherokees to the late United States Factory, provided the same does not exceed three thousand five hundred dollars.

secured to them by the Treaty of Sth January, 1817, and the Convention of the 27th February, 1819.

Art . 8. The Cherokee Nation, West of the Mississippi having, by this agreement, freed themselves from the harassing and ruinous effects

consequent upon a location amidst a white population, and secured to

themselves and their posterity, under the solemn sanction of the guarantee

of the United States, as contained in this agreement, a large extent of

But, if the source of the Arkansas river shall be found to fall north or south of latitude 42, then the line shall run from the said source due south or north, as the case may be, till it meets the said parallel of latitude 42; and thence, along the said parallel, to the South sea. All the islands in the Sabine, and the said Red and Arkansas rivers, throughout the course thus described, to belong to the United States; but the use of the waters, and the navigation of the Sabine to the sea, and of the said rivers Roxo and Arkansas, throughout the extent of the said boundary on their respective banks, shall be common to the respective inhabitants of both nations.

They shall make out plans, and keep journals of their proceedings; and the result agreed upon by them shall be considered as part of this treaty, and shall have the same force as if it were inserted therein.

ARTICLE VIII.

TREATY WITH PRUSSIA. 1828.

Certain stipulations in former treaties revived.
Security of neutral navigation to be the subject of future treaty. Vessels enter-
ing blockaded ports.

ARTICLE XII. The twelfth article of the treaty of amity and commerce, concluded between the parties in 1785, and the articles from the thirteenth to the twenty-fourth, inclusive, of that which was concluded at Berlin in 1799, with the exception of the last paragraph in the nineteenth article, relating to the treaties with Great Britain, are, hereby, revived with the same force and virtue, as if they made part of the context of the present treaty; it being, however, understood that the stipulations contained in the articles thus revived, shall be always considered as, in no manner, affecting the treaties or conventions concluded by either party with other powers, during the interval between the expiration of the said treaty of 1799, and the commencement of the operation of the present treaty. The parties being still desirous, in conformity with their intention declared in the twelfth article of the said treaty of 1799, to establish between themselves, or in concert with other maritime powers, further provisions to ensure just protection and freedom to neutral navigation and commerce, and which may, at the same time, advance the cause of civilization and humanity, engage again to treat on this subject, at some future and convenient period.
ARTICLE XIII. Considering the remoteness of the respective countries of the two high contracting parties, and the uncertainty resulting therefrom, with respect to the various events which may take place, it is agreed that a merchant vessel belonging to either of them, which may be bound to a port supposed, at the time of its departure to be blockaded, shall not, however, be captured or condemned, for having attempted, a first time, to enter said port, unless it can be proved that said vessel could, and ought to, have learnt, during its voyage, that the blockade of the place in question still continued. But all vessels which, after having been warned off once, shall, during the same voyage, attempt a second time to enter the same blockaded port, during the continuance of the said blockade, shall then subject themselves to be detained and condemned.

Provisions as to personal property of citizens, &e.

ARTICLE XIV. The citizens or subjects of each party shall have power to dispose of their personal goods within the jurisdiction of the other, by testament, donation, or otherwise, and their representatives, being citizens or subjects of the other party, shall succeed to their said personal goods, whether by testament, or ab intestate, and may take possession thereof, either by themselves, or by others acting for them, and dispose of the same, at their will, paying such dues only as the inhabitants of the country wherein the said goods are, shall be subject to pay in like cases. And in case of the absence of the representative, such care shall be taken of the said goods, as would be taken of the goods of a native, in like case, until the lawful owner may take measures for receiving them. And if question should arise among several claimants, to which of them said goods belong, the same shall be decided finally by the laws and judges of the land wherein the said goods are. And where, on the death of any person holding real estate, within the territories of the one party, such real estate would, by the laws of the land, descend on a citizen or subject of the other, were he not disqualified by alienage, such citizen or subject shall be allowed a reasonable time to sell the same, and to withdraw the proceeds without molestation, and exempt from all duties of detraction, on the part of the Government of the respective States. But this article shall not derogate, in any manner, from the force of the laws already published, or hereafter to be

ARTICLE XII. L'article douze du traite d'amitie et de commerce, conclu entre les parties en 1785; et les articles treize et suivans, jusqu'a Particle vingtquatre, inclusivement, du traite conclu a Berlin, en 1799, en exceptant le dernier paragraphe de Particle dix-neuf, touchant les traites avec la Grand Bretagne, sont remis en vigueur, et auront la meme force et valeur que s'ils faisoient partie du present Traite: il est entendu, cependant que les stipulations contenues dans les articles ainsi remis en vigueur, seront toujours censees ne rien changer aux Traites et conventions conclus de part et d'autre, avec d'autres Puissances, dans Pintervalle ecoule entre Pexpiration dudit Traite de 1799, et le commencement de la mise en vigueur du present Traite.

Les Parties Contractantes desirant toujours conformement a Pintention declaree dans PArticle Douze dudit Traite de 1799, pourvoir, entre Elies, ou conjointement avec d'autres Puissances maritimes, a des stipulations ulterieures qui puissent servir a garantir une juste protection et liberte au commerce et a la navigation des neutres, et a aider la cause de la civilisation et de Phumanite, Pengagent ici, comme alors a concerter ensemble sur ce sujet, a quelque epoque future et convenable.
ARTICLE XIII. Vu Peloignement des Pays respectifs des deux Hautes Parties Contractantes, et Pincertitude qui en resulte sur les divers evenemens qui peuvent avoir lieu; il est convenu qu' un batiment marchand, appartenant a PUne d'Elles, qui se trouveroit destine pour un port suppose bloque, au moment du depart de ce batiment, ne sera cependant pas capture ou condamne, pour avoir essaye une premiere fois d'entrer dans ledit port, a moins qu' il ne puisse etre prouve que ledit batiment avoit pu et du apprendre en route que 1'etat de blocus de la place en question duroit encore: mais les batimens qui, apres avoir ete renvoyes une fois, essayeroient, pendant le meme voyage d'entrer une seconde fois dans le meme port bloque, durant la continuation de ce blocus, se trouveront alors sujets a etre detenus et condamnes.

ARTICLE XIV.

Les citoyens ou sujets de chacune des Parties Contractantes, auront, dans les Etats de Pautre, la liberte de disposer de leurs biens personnels, soit par testament, donation, ou autrement, et leurs heritiers, etant sujets ou citoyens de Pautre Partie Contractante, succederont a leurs biens, soit en vertu d'un testament, ou ab intestato, et ils pourront en prendre possession, soit en personae, soit par d'autres agissant en leur place, et en disposeront a leur volonte, en ne pay ant d'autres droits que ceux auxquels les habitans du pays ou se trouvent lesdits biens sont assujettis en pareille occasion. En cas d'absence des heritiers, on prendra provisoirernent desdits biens les memes soins qu'on auroit pris en pareille occasion des biens des natifs du pays, jusqu' a. ce que le proprietaire legitime ait agree des arrangemens pour recueillir Pheritage. S'il s'eleve des contestations entre differens pretendans ayant droit a la succession, elles seront decidees en dernier ressort,`selon les lois et par les juges du pays ou la succession est vacante. Et si, par la mort de quelque personne possedant des biens-fonds sur le territoire de Pune des Parties Contractantes, ces biens-fonds venoient a passer, selon les lois du pays, a un citoyen ou sujet de Pautre partie, celui-ci, si, par sa qualite d'etranger, il est inhabile a les posseder, obtiendra un delai convenable pour les yendre, et pour en retirer le produit sans obstacle, et exempt de tout droit de retenue, de la part du gouvernement des Etats respectifs. Mais cet article ne derogera en aucune maniere a la force des lois qui ont

It is understood, however, that the relations and conventions which now exist or may hereafter exist between Brazil and Portugal, shall form an exception to this article.
ARTICLE III. The two high contracting parties being likewise desirous of placing the commerce and navigation of their respective countries, on the liberal basis of perfect equality and reciprocity, mutually agree, that the citizens and subjects of each may frequent all the coasts and countries of the other, and reside and trade there in all kinds of produce, manufactures and merchandize: and they shall enjoy all the rights, privileges and exemptions, in navigation and commerce, which native citizens or subjects do, or shall enjoy, submitting themselves, to the laws, decrees, and usages, there established, to which native citizens or subjects are subjected. But it is understood that this article does not include the coasting trade of either country, the regulation of which is reserved by the parties respectively, according to their own separate laws.

It shall likewise be lawful for the citizens and subjects aforesaid, to sail with the ships and merchandizes before mentioned, and to trade with the same liberty and security, from the places, ports, and havens, of those who are enemies of either party, without any opposition, or disturbance whatsoever, not only directly from the places of the enemy before mentioned, to neutral places, but also from one place belonging to an enemy to another place belonging to an enemy, whether they be under the jurisdiction of one power, or under several. And it is hereby stipulated, that free ships shall also give freedom to goods, and that every thing shall be deemed to be free, and exempt, which shall be found on board the ships belonging to the citizens or subjects of either of the contracting parties, although the whole lading, or any part thereof, should appertain to the enemies of either, contraband goods being always excepted. It is also agreed in like manner, that the same liberty be extended to persons who are on board a free ship, with this effect, that although they be enemies to both or either party, they are not to be taken out of that free ship, unless they are officers or soldiers, and in the actual service of the enemies: Provided, however, and it is hereby agreed, that the stipulations in this article contained, declaring that the flag shall cover the property, shall be understood as applying to those Powers only, who recognize this principle; but if either of the two contracting parties shall be at war with a third, and the other neutral, the flag of the neutral shall cover the property of enemies whose governments acknowledge this principle,

TREATY WITH BRAZIL. 1828.

Contraband goods, what.

ARTICLE XVI.
This liberty of commerce and navigation shall extend to all kinds of merchandizes, excepting those only which are distinguished by the name of contraband; and under this name of contraband, or prohibited goods, shall be comprehended--
1st. Cannons, mortars, howitzers, swivels, blunderbusses, muskets, fuzees, rifles, carbines, pistols, pikes, swords, sabres, lances, spears, halberds, and grenades, bombs, powder, matches, balls, and all other things belonging to the use of these arms :

Contraband goods subject to confiscation,
Vessel not to be detained, unless, &c.

ARTICLE XVII. All other merchandize and things not comprehended in the articles of contraband, expressly enumerated and classified as above, shall be held and considered as free, and subjects of free and lawful commerce, so that they may be carried and transported in the freest manner by both the contracting parties, even to places belonging to an enemy, excepting only those places which are at that time besieged or blockaded; and to avoid all doubt in this particular, it is declared, that those places only are besieged or blockaded, which are actually attacked by a force capable of preventing the entry of the neutral,
ARTICLE XVIII. The articles of contraband, before enumerated and classified, which may be found in a vessel bound for an enemy's port, shall be subject to detention and confiscation, leaving free the rest of the cargo and the ship, that the owners may dispose of them as they see proper. No vessel of either of the two nations shall be detained on the high seas, on account of having on board articles of contraband, whenever the master, captain or supercargo of said vessels, will deliver up the articles of contraband to the captor, unless the quantity of such articles be so great, and of so large a bulk, that they cannot be received on board the capturing ship without great inconvenience: but in this and all the other cases of just detention, the vessel detained shall be sent to the nearest convenient and safe port, for trial and judgment, according to law.

Notice of blockade to be given, &c.
Free egress allowed in certain cases.

ARTICLE XIX. And whereas it frequently happens that vessels sail for a port or/ a place belonging to an enemy, without knowing that the same is besieged, blockaded, or invested, it is agreed that every vessel so circumstanced, may be turned away from such port or place, but shall not be detained, nor shall any part of her cargo, if not contraband, be confiscated, unless, after warning of such blockade or investment from any officer commanding a vessel of the blockading forces, she shall again attempt to enter ; but she shall be permitted to go to any other port or place she shall think proper: Nor shall any vessel of either that may have entered into such port before the same was actually besieged, blockaded, or invested by the other, be restrained from quitting such place with her cargo, nor if found therein, after the reduction and surrender, shall such vessel or her cargo, be liable to confiscation, but they shall be restored to the owners thereof. And if any vessel having thus entered the port before the blockade took place, shall take on board a cargo after the blockade be established, she shall be subject to being

TREATY WITH BRAZIL. 1828.

395

warned by the blockading forces to return to the port blockaded, and discharge the said cargo, and if after receiving the said warning the vessel shall persist in going out with the cargo, she shall be liable to the same consequences as a vessel attempting to enter a blockaded port after being warned off by the blockading forces.
ARTICLE XX.
In order to prevent all kinds of disorder in the visiting and examination of the ships and cargoes of both the contracting parties on the high seas, they have agreed mutually, that whenever a vessel of war, public, or private, shall meet with a neutral of the other contracting party, the first shall remain at the greatest distance compatible with making the visit under the circumstances of the sea and wind and the degree of suspicion attending the vessel to be visited, and shall send its smallest boat, in order to execute the said examination of the papers concerning the ownership and cargo of the vessel, without causing the least extortion, violence, or ill treatment, for which the commanders of the said armed ships shall be responsible with their persons and property; for which purpose the commanders of the said private armed vessels shall, before receiving their commissions, give sufficient security to answer for all the damages they may commit; and it is expressly agreed, that the neutral party shall in no case be required to go on board the examining vessel, for the purpose of exhibiting her papers, or for any other purpose whatever.
ARTICLE XXI.
To avoid all kind of vexation and abuse in the examination of the papers relating to the ownership of the vessels belonging to the citizens and subjects of the two contracting parties, they have agreed, and do agree, that in case one of them shall be engaged in war, the ships and vessels belonging to the citizens or subjects of the other, must be furnished with sea-letters or passports, expressing the name, property and bulk of the ship, as also the name and place of habitation of the master or commander of said vessel, in order that it may thereby appear that the ship really and truly belongs to the citizens or subjects of one of the parties; they have likewise agreed, that such ships being laden, besides the said sea-letters or passports, shall also be provided with certificates, containing the several particulars of the cargo, and the place whence the ship sailed, so that it may be known, whether any forbidden or contraband goods be on board the same; which certificates shall be made out by the officers of the place whence the ship sailed, in the accustomed form; without such requisites said vessel may be detained, to be adjudged by the competent tribunal, and may be declared legal prize, unless the said defect shall be proved to be owing to accident, and be satisfied or supplied by testimony entirely equivalent.

request and expense of those who reclaim them, to be sent to the ships
