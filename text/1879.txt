general distribution, and for the sake of philanthropy, and with no desire for pecuniary gain; and
Whereas the States of Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, New Jersey, and Delaware have made appropriations for the aid of said American Printing House for the Blind, of which, on account of the outbreak of the civil war, only a small part of the money appropriated by the first three named States was ever available; and
Whereas by the money from the States of Kentucky, New Jersey, and Delaware, a printing-house for the blind was established, and is now supplied with presses, type, stereotype foundry, steam-engine, a wellequipped bindery, and all the appliances necessary for the manufacture of embossed books, and has for the last ten years been manufacturing embossed books superior in every way to any manufactured elsewhere, which have been distributed gratuitously to the blind in the States of Kentucky, New Jersey, and Delaware, by which the blind in those States have been very much benefited; and
Whereas it is desirable that the blind of the whole country should be equally benefited, and the intentions of the trustees to establish an educational institution of the most practical beneficence and wisest philanthropy upon a national basis, should be accomplished, inasmuch as the education of the blind is a subject of national importance: Therefore,
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the sum of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars, out of money in the United States Treasury not otherwise appropriated, be, and hereby is, set apart as a perpetual fund for the purpose of aiding the education of the blind in the United States of America, through the American Printing House for the Blind.
Sec . 2. That the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States is hereby directed to hold said sum in trust for the purpose aforesaid; and it shall be his duty, upon the passage of this act, to invest said sum in United States interest-bearing bonds, bearing interest at four per centum, of the issue of July, eighteen hundred and seventy, and upon their maturity to reinvest their proceeds in other United States interest-bearing bonds, and so on forever.
Sec . 3. That the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States is hereby authorized to pay over, semi-annually, to the trustees of the Amercian Printing House for the Blind, located in Louisville, Kentucky, and chartered in eighteen hundred and fifty-eight by the legislature of Kentucky, upon the requisition of their president, countersigned by their treasurer, the semi-annual interest upon the said bonds, upon the following conditions:
First. The income upon the bonds thus held in trust for the education of the blind shall be expended by the trustees of the American Printing House each year in manufacturing and furnishing embossed books for the blind and tangible apparatus for their instruction ; and the total amount of such books and apparatus so manufactured and furnished by this income shall each year be distributed among all the public institutions for the education of the blind in the States and Territories of the United States and the District of Columbia, upon the requisition of the superintendent of each, duly certified by its board of trustees. The basis of such distribution shall be the total number of pupils in all the public institutions for the education of the blind, to be authenticated in such manner and as often as the trustees of the said American Printing House shall require; and each institution shall receive, in books and apparatus, that portion of the total income of said bonds held by the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States in trust for the education of the blind, as is shown by the ratio between the number of pupils in that institution for the education of the blind and the total number of pupils in all the public institutions for the education of the blind, which ratio shall be computed upon the first Monday in January of each year.
Second. No part of the income from said bonds shall be expended in the erection or leasing of buildings.

Third. No profit shall be put on any books or tangible apparatus for the instruction of the blind manufactured or furnished by the trustees of said American Printing House for the Blind, located in Louisville, Kentucky; and the price put upon each article so manufactured or furnished shall only be its actual cost.
Fourth. The Secretary of the Treasury of the United States shall have the authority to withhold the income arising from said bonds thus set apart for the education of the blind of the United States whenever he shall receive satisfactory proof that the trustees of said American Printing House for the Blind, located in Louisville, Kentucky, are not using the income from these bonds for the benefit of the blind in the public institutions for the education of the Blind in the United States.
Fifth. Before any money be paid to the treasurer of the American Printing House for the Blind by the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States, the treasurer of the American Printing House for the Blind shall execute a bond, with two approved sureties, to the amount of twenty thousand dollars, conditioned that the interest so received shall be expended according to this law and all amendments thereto, which shall be held by the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States, and shall be renewed every two years.
Sixth. The superintendents of the various public institutions for the education of the blind in the United States shall each, ex officio, be a member of the board of trustees of the American Printing House for the Blind, located in the city of Louisville, Kentucky.
Sec . 4. That the trustees of said American Printing House for the Blind shall annually make to the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States a report of the items of their expenditure of the income of said bonds during the year preceding their report, and shall annually furnish him with a voucher from each public institution for the education of the blind, showing that the amount of books and tangible apparatus due has been received.
Sec . 5. That this act shall take effect from and after its passage.

"Beginning at the point on the Potomac River where the line between Virginia and West Virginia strikes the said river at low-water mark, and thence, following the meanderings of said river, by the low-water mark, to Smith's Point, at or near the mouth of the Potomac, in the latitude thirty-seven degrees fifty-three minutes eight seconds, and longitude seventy-six degrees thirteen minutes forty-six seconds; thence crossing the waters of the Chesapeake Bay, by a line running north sixty-five degrees thirty minutes east, about nine and a half nautical miles, to a point on the western shore of Smiths Island, at the north end of Sassafras Hammock, in latitude thirty-seven degrees fifty-seven minutes thirteen seconds, longitude seventy-six degrees two minutes fifty-two seconds; thence across Smith's Island south eighty-eight degrees thirty minutes east, five thousand six hundred and twenty yards, to the center of Horse Hammock, on the eastern shore of Smith's Island, in latitude thirty-seven degrees fifty-seven minutes eight seconds, longitude seventyfive degrees fifty-nine minutes twenty seconds; thence south seventynine degrees thirty minutes east, four thousand eight hundred and eighty yards, to a point marked A on the accompanying map, in the middle of Tangier Sound, in latitude thirty-seven degrees fifty-six minutes forty-two seconds, longitude seventy-five degrees fifty-six minutes twenty-three seconds, said point bearing from Janes Island light south fifty-four degrees west, and distant from that light three thousand five hundred and sixty yards; thence south ten degrees thirty minutes west, four thousand seven hundred and forty yards, by a line dividing the waters of Tangier Sound, to a point where it intersects the straight line from Smith's Point to Watkin's Point said point of intersection being in lati-
tude thirty-seven degrees fifty-four minutes twenty-one seconds, longitude seventy-five degrees fifty-six minutes fifty-five seconds, bearing from Jane's Island light south twenty-nine degrees west, and from Horse Hammock south thirty-four degrees thirty minutes east; this point of intersection is marked B on the accompanying map; thence north eighty-five degrees

" First. The measurements being taken and places fixed according to the Coast Survey, we have come as near to perfect mathematical accuracy as in the nature of things is possible; but in case of any inaccuracy in the described course or length of a fine or in the latitude or longitude of a place, the natural objects called for must govern.
"Second. The middle thread of Pocomoke River is equi-distant as nearly as may be between the two shores without considering arms, inlets, creeks, or affluents as parts of the river, but measuring the shore fines from headland to headland.
" Third. The low-water mark on the Potomac, to which Virginia has a right in the soil, is to be measured by the same rule, that is to say, from low-water mark at one headland to low-water mark at another, without following indentations, bays, creeks, inlets, or affluent rivers.
" Fourth. Virginia is entitled not only to full dominion over the soil to low-water mark on the south shore of the Potomac, but has a right to such use of the river beyond the line of low-water mark as may be necessary to the full enjoyment of her riparian ownership, without impeding the navigation or otherwise interfering with the proper use of it by Maryland, agreeably to the compact of seventeen hundred and eighty-
five.

sioner of Internal Revenue for the purpose of making surveys of distilleries in that district, to make a survey of such distillery for the purpose of estimating and determining its true spirit-producing capacity for a day of twenty-four hours. In all surveys, forty-five gallons of mash or beer brewed or fermented from grain shall represent not less than one bushel of grain, and seven gallons of mash or beer brewed or fermented from molasses shall represent not less than one gallon of molasses, except in distilleries operating on the sour mash principle, in which distilleries sixty gallons of beer brewed or fermented from grain shall represent not less than one bushel of grain. A written report of such survey shall be made in triplicate, of which one copy shall be delivered to the distiller, one copy shall be retained by the collector, and one copy shall be transmitted to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and the survey shall take effect upon the delivery of such copy to the distiller. Whenever the Commissioner is satisfied that any report of the capacity of a distillery is incorrect or needs revision, he shall direct the collector to make in like manner another survey of said distillery, and the report thereof shall be made and deposited as hereinbefore required: Provided, That the survey of any distillery estimated and stated by the distiller, in his notice of intention to distill, as capable of distilling not more than one hundred and fifty proof-gallons of distilled spirits every twenty-four hours may be made by the collector or by a deputy collector without the aid of an assistant; and that all surveys made for the purpose of correcting clerical errors or errors of computation existing in the report of a previous survey, and all surveys made for the purpose of changing the true spirit-producing capacity of any distillery for a day of twenty-four hours as estimated and determined by a previous survey, but which surveys do not require the remeasuring of the fermentingtubs in a grain or molasses distillery, or the still or stills in a distillery of apples, peaches, or grapes exclusively, may be made without taking the measurements of the fermenting tubs or stills, as the case may be, and without revisiting the distillery: And provided further, That the Commissioner of Internal Revenue may, whenever he shall deem it proper,
designate an officer, agent, or person other than the collector or deputy collector, to make, with or without the aid of a designated assistant, the surveys and resurveys hereinabove provided for."
That section thirty-two hundred and seventy-six and section thirtytwo hundred and eighty six be amended by inserting, before the words " one thousand dollars" wherever they occur in each of said sections, the
words "not exceeding". That section thirty-two hundred and eighty-two of the Revised Stat-
utes be amended by striking out the words " or any vapor of alcoholic spirits", immediately following the word " alcohol" in the eighth line of said section, and also by striking out the words at the close of said section namely: " But nothing herein contained shall be construed to authorize the distillation of such fermented liquids except in an authorized distillery ", and inserting in lieu thereof the following: "But no worm, goose-neck, pipe, conductor, or contrivance of any description whatsoever whereby vapor might in any manner be conveyed away and converted into distilled spirits, shall be used or employed or be fastened to or connected with any vaporizing apparatus used for the manufacture of vinegar; nor shall any worm be permitted on or near the premises where such vaporizing process is carried on. Nor shall any vinegar factory, for the manufacture of vinegar as aforesaid, be permitted within six hundred feet of any distillery or rectifying house. But it shall be lawful for manufacturers of vinegar to separate, by a vaporizing process, the alcoholic property from the mash produced by them, and condense the same by introducing it into the water or other liquid used in making vinegar. No person, however, shall remove, or cause to be removed, from any vinegar factory or place where vinegar is made, any vinegar or other fluid or material containing a greater proportion than two per centum of proof spirits.

The Commissioner of Internal Revenue, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, may exempt distillers whose distilleries have a daily spirit-producing capacity of thirty gallons of proof spirits, or less, from such of the provisions of existing law in regard to grain distilleries which require the processes of distillation to be carried on through continuous closed vessels and pipes, or which require the cisterns to be connected with the outlet of the worm or condenser by suitable pipes or other apparatus or which require certain clear spaces about the cisterns and other vessels of the distillery, or which require the distillers to have or furnish a plan of the distillery, as he may deem proper.

Such serial number for every distillery shall be in regular sequence of the serial number thereof, beginning with number one (No. 1) with the first cask deposited therein after July twentieth, eighteen hundred and
sixty-eight, and no two or more casks warehoused at the same distillery shall be marked with the same number. The said stamp shall be as

"A new bond shall be required in case of the death, insolvency, or removal of either of the sureties, and may be required in any other contingency affecting its validity or impairing its efficiency, at the discretion of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. And in case the distiller or owner fails or refuses to give the bond hereinbefore required, or to renew the same, or neglects to immediately withdraw the spirits and pay the tax thereon, or if he neglects to withdraw any bonded spirits and pay the tax thereon before the expiration of the time limited in the bond, the collector shall proceed to collect the tax by distraint, issuing his warrant of distraint for the amount of tax found to be due, as ascertained by him from the report of the gauger if no bond was given, or from the terms of the bond if a bond was given. But this provision shall not exclude any other remedy or proceeding provided by law."
"If it shall appear at any time that there has been a loss of distilled spirits from any cask or other package hereafter deposited in a distillery warehouse, other than the loss provided for in section three thousand two hundred and twenty one of the Revised Statutes of the United States, which, in the opinion of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, is excessive, he may instruct the collector of the district in which the loss has occurred, to require the withdrawal from warehouse of such spirits, and to collect the tax accrued upon the original quantity of distilled spirits entered into the warehouse in such cask or package, together with the interest accrued thereon, if any, notwithstanding that the time specified in any bond given for the withdrawal of the spirits entered into warehouse in such cask or package has not expired. If the said tax and interest are not paid on demand, the collector shall report the amount clue upon his next monthly list, and it shall be assessed and collected as other taxes are assessed and collected."

A PROCLAMATION.

Preamble. Convening Congress in extra session.

Whereas the final adjournment of the Forty-fifth Congress without making the usual and necessary appropriations for the legislative, executive and judicial expenses of the Government for the fiscal year ending

June 30, 1880, and without making the usual and necessary appropriations for the support of the Army for the same fiscal year, presents an

extraordinary occasion requiring the President to exercise the power

vested in him by the Constitution to convene the Houses of Congress in anticipation of the day fixed by law for their next meeting:

Now, therefore, I, Rutherford B. Hayes, President of the United States, do, by virtue of the power to this end in me vested by the Constitution, convene both Houses of Congress to assemble at their respective chambers at 12 o'clock noon on Tuesday the eighteenth day of

March instant, then and there to consider and determine such measures as, in their wisdom, their duty and the welfare of the people may seem to demand.

In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
Done at the city of Washington this fourth day of March, in the year of our Lord, one thousand eight hundred and seventy-nine, and
[l . s .] of the Independence of the United States of America, the One Hundred and Third.

No. 1.

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:

April 26, 1879.

A PROCLAMATION.

Whereas, it has become known to me that certain evil disposed persons have within the territory and jurisdiction of the United States, begun and set on foot preparations for an organized and forcible possession of, and settlement upon the lands of what is known as the Indian Territory, west of the State of Arkansas, which Territory is designated, recognized and described by the treaties and laws of the United States, and by the Executive Authorities, as Indian Country, and as such, is only subject to occupation by Indian tribes, officers of the Indian Department, military posts and such persons as may be privileged to reside and trade therein under the intercourse laws of the United States.
And whereas those laws provide for the removal of all persons residing and trading therein, without express permission of the Indian Department and agents, and also of all persons whom such agents may deem to be improper persons to reside in the Indian Country:
Now, therefore, for the purpose of properly protecting the interests of the Indian nations and tribes, as well as of the United States in said Indian Territory, and of duly enforcing the laws governing the same, I, Rutherford B. Hayes, President of the United States, do admonish and warn all such persons so intending or preparing to remove upon said lands or into said Territory, without permission of the proper agent of the Indian Department, against any attempt to so remove or settle upon any of the lands of said Territory; and I do further warn and notify any and all such persons who may so offend, that they will be speedily and immediately removed therefrom by the agent according to the laws made and provided; and if necessary the aid and assistance of the military forces of the United States will be invoked to carry into proper execution the laws of the United States herein referred to.
In testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
Done at the city of Washington, this twenty-sixth day of April, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and seventy-nine,

A PROCLAMATION.

Preamble. Appointing Thursday, November 27', 1879, T kanksgi ving day.

At no recurrence of the season which the devout habit of a religious people has made the occasion for giving thanks to Almighty God and humbly invoking His continued favor, has the material prosperity enjoyed by our whole country been more conspicuous, more manifold or more universal.
During the past year, also, unbroken peace with all foreign nations, the general prevalence of domestic tranquillity, the supremacy and security of the great institutions of civil and religious freedom, have gladdened the hearts of our people, and confirmed their attachment to their government, which the wisdom and courage of our ancestors so fitly framed and the wisdom and courage of their descendants have so firmly maintained, to be the habitation of liberty and justice to successive generations.
Now, therefore, I, Rutherford B. Hayes, President of the United States, do appoint Thursday, the 27th day of November, instant, as a Day of National Thanksgiving and Prayer; and I earnestlyrecommend that, withdrawing themselves from secular cares and labors, the people of the United States do meet together on that day in their respective places of worship, there to give thanks and praise to Almighty God for His mercies, and to devoutly beseech their continuance.
In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
Done at the City of Washington this third day of November, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and seventy-nine,

Orders which cannot for any cause be paid to the person, for whom they are intended, 'shall become void, according to the regulations established in the country of destination, and the sums received therefor shall remain at the disposal of the Postal Administration of the country of origin, so that they may be repaid to the persons interested, or otherwise disposed of, according to the rules established by the laws or regulations of each country. The Postal Administration of Germany will therefore place, in the quarterly account, to the credit of the Postal Administration of the United States, all money orders, which are entered in the fists received from the United States, and which become void by reason of non-payment in Germany. A detailed statement of such orders shall furthermore be transmitted to the Post Office Department of the United States by the German Exchange Office at the close of each month. On the other hand, the Postal Administration of the United States shall, at the close of each month, promptly transmit to the German Exchange Office, for entry in the quarterly account, a detailed statement of all similar unpaid orders, which were originally certified in the lists from the latter office, and which under this

R e p a y m ent of orders lost, missent, or destroyed, &c.

The remitter of an order missent, lost or destroyed, must furnish, in order to obtain repayment thereof, a declaration from the payee to the effect that the same has not reached him, or, if received, that it has not been transferred by indorsement, or otherwise disposed of by him; or that it has been lost or destroyed
after its receipt. The Administration of the coun-
try of origin will not, however, authorize repayment until after the Administration of the country of destination shall have returned the advice or furnished a declaration that it has not paid, and will not pay the order.
In such case the United States Postal Administration will cause the proper entries to be made in the records of the New York Ex-
change Office.

L'envoyeur d'un mandat egare. perdu ou detruit, devra, pour en obtenir le remboursement, fournir une declaration du destinataire portant que le mandat n'a ete ni aliene ni transmis par voie d'endossement, qu'il ne lui est pas parvenu, ou qu'il a ete adire ou detruit apres la reception.
L'Administration du pays d'origine n'accordera toutefois le remboursement qu'apres que 1'Administration du pays de destination lui aura renvoye 1'avis d'emission ou declare qu'elle n'a pas paye et ne paiera pas le mandat.
En pareil cas 1'Administration des Postes des Etats-Unis fera rectifier en consequence les ecritures du bureau d'echange de New York.
