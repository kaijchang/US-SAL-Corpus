Stat. , 15, 167. Preamble.

Whereas, the United States by the enactment of the one hundred and seventh section of the act of Congress approved the twentieth day of July, anno Domini eighteen hundred and sixty-eight superseded the tenth section of the treaty entered into by and between the United States

and the Cherokee Nation on the nineteenth day of July, anno Domini eighteen hundred and sixty-six ; and

Whereas the property of Elias C. Boudinot, a Cherokee Indian, was seized and disposed of by the authorities of the United States in conse-

quence of the enactment of said one hundred and seventh section, although the Supreme Court of the United States in its opinion expressed in the case prosecuted by said Elias C. Boudinot to test the constitutionality of said one hundred and seventh section and the validity of the said seizure and disposition of his property, and reported in eleventh Wallace

United States Supreme Court Reports, page six hundred and sixteen entitled "The Cherokee Tobacco", declared " that there was no ground

for any imputation upon the integrity or good faith of" him, the said Elias C. Boudinot ; and, further, that it is to be presumed that if a wrong has been done to him, the said Elias C. Boudinot, the Congress of the

United States will promptly give the proper relief if applied to by the said Elias C. Boudinot ; and

Whereas the Supreme Court of the United States was not called upon to decide, and did not decide, whether the executive officers of the United States had taken the necessary steps to make operative said one hundred and seventh section in said Cherokee Nation anterior to said

seizure of the property of said Elias C. Boudinot ; and Whereas there is grave doubt that such steps were taken, and it mani-
festly appears that a wrong has been done to said Elias C. Boudinot, in consequence of the casual infraction of the said treaty, which should be

repaired by appropriate satisfaction in maintenance of said treaty, which still subsists ; Now therefore,

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United

Elias C. Boudi- States of America in Congress assembled, That in order to give Elias C.

not authorized to Boudinot, of the Cherokee Nation the proper relief for the wrong done bring suit in Court

of Claims.

said Elias C. Boudinot, be, and he is hereby, authorized to bring suit in

revenue laws, of his property, a tobacco factory, its detention, and damage thereto whilst under seizure, the value of the tobacco, material, and

other personal property also seized, and the expenses to which he was subjected thereby.

Accounts.

The postal Administration of

France and the Postal Administra-

tion of the United States shall, at

certain periods to be fixed by them,

by mutual agreement, prepare a

statement of the amounts of their reciprocal indebtedness ; and these

accounts, after having been exam-

shall be paid within a limited time ,

to be determined by common con-

sent, in the money (of gold value)

of the creditor country by the Administration, which shall be found indebted to the other.

Payment of bal- For this purpose the smaller

credit shall be converted into the

same money as that of the larger credit. This conversion shall be

based upon the average of the rates of exchange quoted at Paris during the period embraced in the account, if the payment is due to the United States ; and upon the average of such rates quoted during a like period at New York, if the payment is due to France. In case of non- In case of the non-payment of the ipnatyermeesntt. to bear balance of an account within the time specified, the amount of such balance shall be chargeable with interest from the date of the expi-
ration of the stipulated period until the day of the transmission of the amount due. Such interest shall

be computed at the rate of five per cent. per annum, and is to be entered in the accounts as a debit against the dilatory Administration.

L'Administration des Postes de France et l'Administration des Postes des États- Unis dresseront, aux époques qui seront fixées par elles d'un commun accord, les comptes des sommes qu'elles auront à se rembourser réciproquement, et ces comptes, après avoir été débattus et arrêtés contradictoirement, seront soldés, en monnaie d'or du pays créancier, par l'Administration qui sera reconnue redevable envers l'autre, dans le délai dont les deux Administrations conviendront.
À cet effet la créance la plus faible sera convertie en même monnaie que la créance la plus forte, en prenant pour base le taux moyen du change qui aura été coté pendant la période à laquelle les comptes se rapporteront, savoir: à Paris, si le solde est en faveur des ÉtatsUnis, et à New York si le solde est en faveur de la France.
En cas de non paiement du solde d'un compte dans le délai convenu, le montant de ce solde sera productif d'intérêts à dater du jour de l'expiration du dit délai jusqu'au jour de l'envoi de la somme due.

No. 1.

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:

April 26, 1879.

A PROCLAMATION.

Whereas, it has become known to me that certain evil disposed persons have within the territory and jurisdiction of the United States, begun and set on foot preparations for an organized and forcible possession of, and settlement upon the lands of what is known as the Indian Ter-

Preamble.

ritory, west of the State of Arkansas, which Territory is designated, recognized and described by the treaties and laws of the United States, and by the Executive Authorities, as Indian Country, and as such, is only subject to occupation by Indian tribes, officers of the Indian Depart-

ment, military posts and such persons as may be privileged to reside and trade therein under the intercourse laws of the United States.

And whereas those laws provide for the removal of all persons residing and trading therein, without express permission of the Indian Department and agents, and also of all persons whom such agents may deem to be improper persons to reside in the Indian Country :
Now, therefore, for the purpose of properly protecting the interests of Settling in the the Indian nations and tribes, as well as of the United States in said Indian Territory.

Indian Territory, and of duly enforcing the laws governing the same, I, Rutherford B. Hayes, President of the United States, do admonish and warn all such persons so intending or preparing to remove upon said lands or into said Territory, without permission of the proper agent of the Indian Department, against any attempt to so remove or settle upon any of the lands of said Territory ; and I do further warn and notify any and all such persons who may so offend, that they will be speedily and immediately removed therefrom by the agent according to the laws made and provided ; and if necessary the aid and assistance of the military forces of the United States will be invoked to carry into proper execution the laws of the United States herein referred to.

In testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.

Done at the city of Washington, this twenty-sixth day of April, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and seventy-nine,

A PROCLAMATION.

Preamble.

At no recurrence of the season which the devout habit of a religious people has made the occasion for giving thanks to Almighty God and humbly invoking His continued favor, has the material prosperity enjoyed by our whole country been more conspicuous, more manifold or more universal.

During the past year, also, unbroken peace with all foreign nations, the general prevalence of domestic tranquillity, the supremacy and security of the great institutions of civil and religious freedom, have gladdened the hearts of our people, and confirmed their attachment to

their government, which the wisdom and courage of our ancestors so fitly framed and the wisdom and courage of their descendants have so

firmly maintained , to be the habitation of liberty and justice to succes-

Preamble.

Whereas it has become known to me that certain evil-disposed persons have, within the territory and jurisdiction of the United States, begun and set on foot preparations for an organized and forcible possession of and settlement upon the lands of what is known as the Indian Territory, west ofthe State of Arkansas, which Territory is designated, recognized, and described by the treaties and laws of the United States, and by the Executive authorities, as Indian Country, and as such is only subject to occupation by Indian tribes, officers of the Indian Department, military posts, and such persons as may be privileged to reside and trade therein under the intercourse laws of the United States :
And whereas those laws provide for the removal of all persons residing and trading therein, without express permission of the Indian Department and agents, and also of all persons whom such agents may deem to be improper persons to reside in the Indian Country :

And whereas, in aid and support of such organized movement, it has been represented that no further action will be taken bythe Government to prevent persons from going into said Territory and settling therein, but such representations are wholly without authority :
Now, therefore, for the purpose of properly protecting the interests of Settling in the the Indian nations and tribes, as well as of the United States, in said Indian Territory. Indian Territory, and of duly enforcing the laws governing the same, I, Rutherford B. Hayes, President of the United States, do admonish and warn all such persons so intending or preparing to remove upon said lands, or into said Territory, without permission of the proper agent of the Indian Department, against any attempt to so remove or settle upon any of the lands of said Territory ; and I do further warn and notify any and all such persons who may so offend that they will be speedily and immediately removed therefrom by the agent, according to the laws made and provided, and that no efforts will be spared to prevent the invasion of said Territory, rumors spread by evil-disposed persons to the contrary notwithstanding ; and if necessary the aid and assistance of the military forces of the United States will be invoked to carry into proper execution the laws of the United States herein referred to.
In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.

nation upon vessels wholly belonging to citizens of the United States,
or upon the produce, manufactures, or merchandise imported in the
same : Discriminating Therefore I , Rutherford B. Hayes, President of the United States of duties heretofore levied upon cer- America, by virtue of the authority in me vested by law, do hereby de-

tain merchandise clare and proclaim, that the foreign discriminating duties of tonnage

imported in Chi- and imposts within the United States are, and shall be, suspended and nese vessels to be discontinued so far as respects the vessels of China and the produce, ldoinsgcaosn,teitcn.ued as manufactures and merchandise imported therein into the United States
from China, or from any other foreign country, so long as the exemption

aforesaid on the part of China, of vessels belonging to citizens of the

-United States and their cargoes shall be continued and no longer.
In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed .
