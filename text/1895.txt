CHAP. 34.--An Act For the relief of homestead settlers in Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Michigan.
Whereas during the summer and autumn of eighteen hundred and ninety-four extensive forest fires prevailed in northern Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Michigan, resulting in the death of many homesteaders and their families, the destruction of their property and effects, and of much of the green timber growing upon them, which homesteads are valuable chiefly for the timber standing and growing on them; and,
Whereas under existing law homesteaders are not allowed to cut or sell green or burned timber, except for the purpose of clearing and improving, and all burned timber not cut within a short period will become worthless and a loss to the settler and the Government: Therefore,
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That all such persons actually occupying homesteads in said States of Wisconsin, Minnesota, and

"Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
"Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.
" But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate, we can not consecrate, we can not hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or

Rule 21. Every steam vessel which is directed by these rules to keep out of the way of another vessel shall, on approaching her, if necessary, slacken her speed or stop or reverse.
Rule 22. Notwithstanding anything contained in these rules every vessel overtaking any other shall keep out of the way of the overtaken
vessel. Rule 23. In all weathers every steam vessel under way in taking any
course authorized or required by these rules shall indicate that course by the following signals on her whistle, to be accompanied whenever required by corresponding alteration of her helm; and every steam vessel receiving a signal from another shall promptly respond with the same signal or, as provided in Rule Twenty-six:
One blast to mean, "I am directing my course to starboard." Two blasts to mean, "I am directing my course to port."

But if the actual machinery space is so large as to amount in the case of paddle vessels to thirty per centum or above, and in the case of screw vessels to twenty per centum or above of the gross tonnage of the ship, the deduction shall consist of thirty-seven per centum of the

gross tonnage of the ship in the case of a paddle vessel and thirty-two per centum of the gross tonnage in the case of a screw vessel; or if the owner prefers there shall be deducted from the gross tonnage of the vessel the tonnage of the space or spaces actually occupied by or required to be inclosed for the proper working of the boilers and machinery, including the trunk shaft or alley in screw steamers, with the addition in the case of vessels propelled with paddlewheels of fifty per centum, and in the case of vessels propelled by screws of seventyfive per centum of the tonnage of such space.

observed by all the people of. the land. On that day let our ordinary work and business be suspended and

let us meet in pur accustomed places of worship and give thanks to Almighty God for our preservation as a nation, for our immunity from disease and pestilence, for the harvests that have rewarded our husbandry, for a renewal of national prosperity and for every advance in

virtue and intelligence that has marked our growth as a People. And with our thanksgiving let us pray that these,blessings may be

multiplied unto us, that our national conscience may be quickened to a better recognition of the power and goodness of God and that in our national life we may clearer see and closer follow the path of right-

eousness. And in our places of worship and praise, as well as in the happy
re-unions of kindred and friends on that day, let us invoke Divine approval by generously remembering the poor aud needy. Surely He,

who has given us comfort and plenty, will look upon our relief of the destitute and our ministrations of charity as the work of hearts truly grateful and as proofs of the sincerity of our thanksgiving.

a party to an international agreement which provides for reciprocity in

the granting of copyright, by the terms of which agreement the United

Whereas: The Congress of the United States passed an Act which

was approved on the sixteenth day of July, eighteen hundred and ninety

equal footing with the original States," which Act provided for the

election of delegates to a Constitutional Convention to meet, at the

seat of government of the Territory of Utah, on the first Monday in

March eighteen hundred and ninety-five, for the purpose of declaring

the adoption of the Constitution of the United States by the people of

the proposed State and forming a Constitution and State Government
