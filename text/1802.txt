[Obsolete.] Appropriation.

either case their rights became extinct, the lands could be granted disencumbered of the right of occupancy, or enjoyed in full dominion by the purchasers from the Indians. Such was the tenure of Indian lands by the laws of Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia. Ibid.
Grants made by the Indians at public councils, since the treaty at Fort Stanwick's, have been made directly to the purchasers, or to the state in which the land lies, in trust for them, or with directions to convey to them; of which there are many instances of large tracts so sold and held ; especially in New York. Ibid.
It was an universal rule, that purchases made at Indian treaties, in the presence, and with the approbation of the officer under whose direction they were held by the authority of the crown, gave a valid title to the lands; it prevailed under the laws of the states after the revolution, and yet continues in those where the right to the ultimate fee is owned by the states, or their grantees. It has been adopted by the United States, and purchases made at treaties held by their authority, have been always held good by the ratification of the treaty, without any patent to the purchasers from the United States. This rule in the colonies was founded on a settled rule of the law of England, that by his prerogative, the king was the universal occupant of all vacant lands in his dominions, and had the right to grant them at his pleasure, or by his authorized officers. Ibid.
When the United States acquired and took possession of the Floridas, the treaties which had been made with the Indian tribes, before the acquisition of the territory by Spain and Great Britain, remained in force over all the ceded territory, as the laws which regulated the relations with all the Indians who were parties to them, and were binding on the United States, by the obligation they had assumed by the Louisiana treaty, as a supreme law of the land, which was inviolable by the power of Congress. They were also binding as the fundamental law of Indian rights ; acknowledged by royal orders, and municipal regulations of the province, as the laws and ordinances of Spain in the ceded provinces, which were declared to continue in force by the proclamation of the governor in taking possession of the provinces ; and by the acts of Congress, which assured all the inhabitants of protection in their property. It would be an unwarranted construction of these treaties, laws, ordinances and municipal regulations, to decide that the Indians were not to be maintained in the enjoyment of all the rights which they could have enjoyed under either, had the provinces remained under the dominion of Spain. It would be rather a perversion of their spirit, meaning and terms, contrary to the injunction of the law under which the court acts, which makes the stipulations of any treaty, the laws and ordinances of Spain, and these acts of Congress, so far as either apply to this case, the standard rules for its decision. Ibid.
The treaties with Spain and England, before the acquisition of Florida by the United States, which guarantied to the Seminole Indians their lands according to the right of property with which they possessed them, were adopted by the United States; who thus became the protectors of all the rights they had previously enjoyed, or could of right enjoy under Great Britain or Spain, as individuals or nations, by any treaty, to which the United States thus became parties in 1803. Ibid.
The Indian right to the lands as property, was not merely of possession, that of alienation was concomitant ; both were equally secured, protected and guarantied by Great Britain and Spain, subject only to ratification and confirmation by the license, charter or deed from the governor representing the king. Such purchases enabled the Indians to pay their debts, compensate for their depredations on the traders resident among them to provide for their wants; while they were available to the purchasers as payment of the considerations which at their expense had been received by the Indians. It would have been a violation of the faith of the government to both, to encourage traders to settle in the province, to put themselves and property in the power of the Indians, to suffer the latter to contract debts, and when willing to pay them by the only means in their power, a cession of their lands, withhold an assent to the purchase, which by their laws or municipal regulations, was necessary to vest a title. Such a course was never adopted by Great Britain, in any of her colonies, nor by Spain in Louisiana or Florida. Ibid.
The laws made it necessary, when the Indians sold their lands, to have the deeds presented to the governor for confirmation. The sales by the Indians transferred the kind of right which they possessed; the ratification of the sale by the governor, must be regarded as a relinquishment of the title of the crown to the purchaser; and no instance is known where permission to sell has been " refused, or the rejection of an Indian sale." Ibid.
The colonial charters, a great portion of the individual grants by the proprietary and royal governments, and a still greater portion by the states of the Union after the revolution, were made for lands within the Indian hunting grounds. North Carolina and Virginia to a great extent paid their officers and soldiers of the revolutionary war by such grants, and extinguished the arrears due the army by similar means. It was one of the great resources which sustained the war, not only by those states, but by other states. The ultimate fee, encumbered with the right of Indian occupancy, was in the crown previous to the revolution, and in the states of the Union afterwards, and subject to grant. This right of occupancy was protected by the political power, and respected by the courts, until extinguished, when the patentee took the unencumbered fee. So the supreme court and the state courts have uniformly held. Clark v. Smith, 13 Peters, 195.

Appro ve d , March 30, 1802.

(a) The decisions of the courts of the United States, on the subject of the Indians, have been : It was doubted whether a state can be seised in fee of lands subject to the Indian title, and whether a decision that they were seised in fee, might not be construed to amount to a decision that their grantee might maintain an ejectment for them, notwithstanding that title. The majority of the court is of opinion that the nature of the Indian title, which is certainly to be respected by all courts until it be legitimately extinguished, is not such as to be absolutely repugnant to a seisin in fee on the part of the state. Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch, 87 ; 2 Cond. Rep. 308. The acts of assembly of North Carolina, passed between the years 1783 and 1789, avoid all entries, surveys, and grants of land set apart for the Cherokee Indians, and no title can be acquired to those lands. Danforth's Lessee v. Thomas, 1 Wheat. 155; 3 Cond. Rep. 524. The boundaries of the reservation made by the laws of North Carolina, have been altered by treaties with the Indians; but it seems that the mere extinguishment of their title does not subject the land to entry, unless expressly authorized by the legislature. Ibid. The condition of the Indians, in relation to the United States, is perhaps unlike that of any other two people in existence. In general, nations not owing a common allegiance, are foreign to each other. The term foreign nation, is with strict propriety applicable by either to the other. But the relation of the Indians to the United States, is marked by peculiar and cardinal distinctions, which exist no where else. The Cherokee Nation v. The State of Georgia, 5 Peters, 1. The Indians are acknowledged to have an unquestionable, and heretofore an unquestioned right to the lands they occupy, until that right shall be extinguished by a voluntary cession to the government. It may well be doubted, whether those tribes which reside within the acknowledged boundaries of the United States, can with strict accuracy be denominated foreign nations. They may more correctly, perhaps, be denominated domestic dependent nations. They occupy a territory to which we assert a title, independent of their will, which must take effect in point of possession, when their right of possession ceases; meanwhile they are in a state of pupilage. Their relations to the United States resemble that of a ward to his guardian. They look to our government for protection ; rely upon its kindness and its power; appeal to it for relief to their wants; and address the President as their great father. Ibid. The treaties and laws of the United States, contemplate the Indian territory as completely separated from that of the states; and provide that all intercourse with them shall be carried on exclusively by the government of the Union. Worcester v. The State of Georgia, 6 Peters, 515. The Indian nations had always been considered as distinct, independent political communities, retaining their original natural rights, as the undisputed possessors of the soil, from time immemorial; with the single exception of that imposed by irresistible power, which excluded them from intercourse with any other European potentate, than the first discoverer of the coast of the particular region claimed : and this was a restriction which those European potentates imposed on themselves, as well as on the Indians. The very term ``nation," so generally applied to them, means "a people distinct from others." The constitution, by declaring treaties already made, as well as those to be made, to be the supreme law of the land, has adopted and sanctioned the previous treaties with the Indian nations, and, consequently, admits their rank among those powers who are capable of making treaties. The words " treaty" and "nation" are words of our own language, selected in our diplomatic and legislative proceedings, by ourselves; having each a definite and well understood meaning. We have applied them to Indians, as we have applied them to other nations of the earth. They are applied to all in the same sense. Ibid. One uniform rule seems to have prevailed in the British provinces in America, by which Indian lands were held and sold, from their first settlement, as appears by their laws ; that friendly Indians were protected in the possession of the lands they occupied, and were considered as owning them by a perpetual right of possession in the tribe or nation inhabiting them, as their common property, from generation to generation, not as the right of the individuals located on particular spots. Subject to this right of possession, the ultimate fee was in the crown, and its grantees ; which could be granted by the crown or colonial legislatures, while the lands remained in possession of the Indians ; though possession could not be taken without their consent. Mitchell v. United States, 9 Peters, 711. Individuals could not purchase Indian lands without permission or license from the crown, colonial governors, or according to the rules prescribed by colonial laws ; but such purchases were valid with such license, or in conformity with the local laws: and by this union of the perpetual right of occupancy with the ultimate fee, which passed from the crown by the license, the title of the purchaser became complete. Ibid. Indian possession or occupation was considered with reference to their habits and modes of life; their hunting grounds were as much in their actual possession, as the cleared fields of the whites; and their rights to its exclusive enjoyment in their own way, and for their own purposes, were as much respected, until they abandoned them, made a cession to the government, or an authorized sale to individuals.

And the several judges of the said circuit court shall have like authority to grant such licenses in vacation, as the justices of the courts of Maryland and Virginia heretofore possessed; and the money arising from such licenses shall be applied to the use and benefit of the said counties, respectively, in such manner, and to such purposes, as the justices of the levy courts in the same shall appoint and direct.

Sec . 4. And be it further enacted, That the districts of the United States (excepting the districts of Maine, Kentucky, and Tennessee) shall be formed into six circuits, in manner following:
The districts of New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Rhode Island, shall constitute the first circuit;

(a) The acts of Congress which regulate the original jurisdiction of the circuit courts, are : An act to establish the judicial courts of the United States, September 24, 1789, chap. 20 ; an act in addition to an act to prohibit the carrying on the slave trade from the United States to any foreign place or country, May 10, 1800, sec. 4; an act to vest more effectually in the state courts, and in the district courts of the United States, jurisdiction in the cases therein mentioned, March 3, 1815. Turners. The Bank of North America, 4 Dall. 8; 1 Cond. Rep. 205.
The inferior courts of the United States, are all of limited jurisdiction, but they are not on that account inferior courts, in the technical sense of those words, whose judgments taken alone, are to be disregarded. If the jurisdiction be not alleged in the proceedings, they are erroneous, but they are not nullities. M`Cormick et al. v. Sullivant et al., 10 Wheat. 192; 6 Cond. Rep. 71.
The justices of the supreme court have by practice and acquiescence under it, for a period of several years, commencing with the organization of the judicial system, sat as circuit judges : this practical exposition is too strong to be shaken or controlled. Stuart v. Laird, 1 Cranch, 299; 1 Cond. Rep. 316.
The circuit court has jurisdiction on a bill in equity, filed by the United States, against the debtor of their debtor, they claiming a priority under the fifty-fifth section of the act of March 2, 1799, notwithstanding the local law of the state allows a creditor to proceed against the debtor of his debtor by a peculiar process.

Sec . 6. And be it further enacted, That whenever any question shall occur before a circuit court, upon which the opinions of the judges shall be opposed, the point upon which the disagreement shall happen, shall, during the same term, upon the request of either party, or their counsel, be stated under the direction of the judges, and certified under the seal of the court, to the supreme court, at their next session to be held thereafter ; and shall, by the said court, be finally decided.(a) And the decision

In case of disagreement in opinion of the judges of the circuit court, that of the supreme court upon the point stated to be conclusive.

(a) The decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States, upon the provisions of this section, are: The law which empowers the supreme court to take cognizance of questions adjourned from a circuit court, gives jurisdiction over the single point on which the judges were divided; not over the whole cause. Wayman et al. v. Southard et al., 10 Wheat. 1 ; 6 Cond. Rep. 1. Where the court is equally divided, the decree of the court below is of course affirmed, so far as the point of division goes. The Antelope, 10 Wheat. 66 ; 6 Cond. Rep. 30. The supreme court has no jurisdiction in a case in which the judges of the circuit court have divided in opinion upon a motion for a rule to show cause why the taxation of the costs of the marshal on an execution should not be reversed and corrected. Bank of the United States v. Green and others, 6 Peters, 26.
Where the court is equally divided in opinion upon a writ of error the judgment of the inferior court is affirmed. Etting v. The Bank of the United States, 11 Wheat. 59; 6 Cond. Rep. 216.
Where a case is certified to the supreme court upon a division of opinion of the judges of the circuit court, and the points upon which they were so divided, are too imperfectly stated to enable the supreme court to pronounce any opinion upon them, it will neither award a venire facias de novo, nor certify any opinion to the court below, but will merely certify that they are too imperfectly stated. Perkins v. Hart's Ex'rs, &c., 11 Wheat. 237; 6 Cond. Rep. 287.
It appeared on a certificate from the circuit court of the United States of Pennsylvania, that the judges of the court were divided on a motion in arrest of judgment. Held, that judgment must be given on the verdict. United States v. Worrall, 2 Dall. 338.
Where a case is certified from a circuit court of the United States, the judges of the circuit court having differed in opinion upon questions of law which arose on the trial of the cause; the supreme court cannot be called upon to express an opinion on the whole facts of the case, instead of upon particular points of law, growing out of the same. Adams, Cunningham & Co. v. Jones, 12 Peters, 207.
The intention of Congress, in passing the act authorizing a division of opinion of the judges of the circuit courts of the United States to be certified to the supreme court was, that a division of the judges of the circuit court, upon a single and material point, in the progress of the cause, should be certified to the supreme court for its opinion; and not the whole cause. When a certificate of division brings up the whole cause, it would be, if the court should decide it, in effect, the exercise of original, rather than appellate jurisdiction. White v. Turk et al., 12 Peters, 238.
This case came up to the supreme court, from the circuit court, upon a division of opinion between the judges of the court. It was decided by the supreme court, that the question certified would, alone, be considered ; each party being left to bring up the whole case from the circuit court, by a writ of error. Ogle v. Lee, 2 Cranch, 33.
The question certified from the circuit court of North Carolina, was, " whether the act of assembly, (of North Carolina,) entitled, an act concerning proving wills, and to prevent frauds in the management of intestates' estates, passed in 1715, recited in the plea of the defendants, was, under all the circumstances stated, and the various acts passed by the legislature of North Carolina, a bar to this action." The certificate stated, that the 9th section of the act had been pleaded by the defendant, in bar to the action. The certificate of the division was granted on the motion of the plaintiff, by his counsel; and at his request, a statement of the facts, e£ made under the direction of the judges," was certified. The certificate, thus made out, set forth all the laws of North Carolina, which operated on the question certified ; and stated the questions which arose in the cause, on which the opinions of the judges were divided. The court decided in favour of the plaintiff. Ogden, Adm'r of Cornell v. Blackledge, Ex'r of Sater, 2 Cranch, 272; 1 Cond. Rep. 411.
The certificate of division of opinion by the judges of the circuit court of Virginia, stated, "In this cause it occurred as a question, whether Hepburn and Dundas, the plaintiffs in this cause, who are citizens and residents in the District of Columbia; and are so stated in the pleadings; can maintain an action in the supreme court against the defendant, who is a citizen and inhabitant of the district and the commonwealth of Virginia, and is also stated so to be in the pleadings : or whether, for want of jurisdiction, the said suit ought to be dismissed." It was certified that the circuit court had no jurisdiction in the case. Hepburn and Dundas v. Ellzey, 2 Cranch, 445; 1 Cond. Rep. 444.
This case was certified from the circuit court of Pennsylvania, the judges being divided in opinion upon the question, " whether, in the state of the pleadings, the judgment ought to be rendered for the plaintiffs." The supreme court said--Judgment, therefore, on the pleadings, must be rendered for the plaintiffs. Mr. Chief Justice Marshall, who delivered the opinion of the court, said : " By the twenty-sixth section of the judicial act, it is directed that, in cases of this description, the court shall render judgment for so much as is due according to equity. And when the sum for which judgment is to be rendered is uncertain, the same shall, if either of the parties request it, be assessed by a jury. In this case, it is the opinion of a majority of the court, that the judgment ought to be rendered for so much as remains due of the sum of one hundred and seventy thousand guilders, calculating interest thereon from the 1st of March, 1803; and if either of the parties request it, that a jury be empannelled to ascertain the value of this sum in money of the United States." United States v. Gurney and others, 4 Cranch, 333; 2 Cond. Rep. 132.
This case was certified on division of opinion of the judges of the circuit court, on a motion in arrest of judgment, the question being, whether the assignee of a part of a patent right, cannot maintain an action on the case, for a violation of the patent right. 6 Cranch, 324.
In this case, the question certified, on which the judges of the circuit were divided in opinion, was

Decision of the supreme to be remitted to the circuit court and to be of effect.

of the supreme court, and their order in the premises, shall be remitted to the circuit court, and be there entered of record, and shall have effect according to the nature of the said judgment and order : Provided, that nothing herein contained shall prevent the cause from proceeding, if, in

whether a writ of habere facias possessionem should be issued; the defendant, in the circuit court of Maryland, having obtained, in a state court, an order for the injunction of the proceedings in the circuit court. The supreme court directed that the writ be issued. M`Kim v. Voorhies, 7 Cranch, 279; 2 Cond. Rep. 492.
The defendant was indicted in the circuit court of Vermont, under embargo laws, for loading carriages with pearl ashes, with intent to export them. The jury found him guilty ; and that the ashes were worth two hundred and eighty dollars. The defendant moved in arrest of judgment, for defect in the finding ; and on the question presented by the motion, the judges were divided in opinion ; which division was certified to the supreme court. United States v. John Tyler, 7 Cranch, 285; 2 Cond. Rep. 492.
The question certified to the supreme court, from the circuit court of West Tennessee, was on the construction of the act of the legislature of Tennessee, relative to possession of lands. Patton's Lessee v. Easton, 1 Wheat. 476; 3 Cond. Rep. 631.
The supreme court of the United States has no jurisdiction of causes brought before it, on a certificate of division of opinion of the judges of the circuit court, for the District of Columbia. The appellate jurisdiction extends, only, to the final judgment and decrees of that court. Ross v. Triplett, 3 Wheat. 600 ; 4 Cond. Rep. 351.
The question referred to the supreme court, by a certificate of division between the judges of the circuit court, on facts stated by the court, was, whether the circuit court of Kentucky could take jurisdiction of a case, when one of the grants for the land in controversy was issued out by the state of Virginia, the other by the state of Kentucky, both grants being founded upon warrants and locations made under the laws of Virginia. Colson v. Lewis, 2 Wheat. 377 ; 4 Cond. Rep. 16S.
The facts of the case being found by a special verdict, and the judges being divided in opinion on questions arising on the verdict, the questions were certified to the supreme court. Somerville's Ex'rs v. Hamilton, 4 Wheat. 230; 4 Cond. Rep. 436.

Holmes et al., 5 Wheat. 412; 4 Cond. Rep. 708.
The defendant was indicted in the circuit court of South Carolina, charging him with wickedly and maliciously concealing a murder committed on the high seas, of which he had knowledge.

On a motion to arrest the judgment, and for a new trial, the judges were opposed in opinion on the motion, which was certified to the supreme court. The supreme court said, a motion for a new trial is not a part of the proceedings of the case.

A motion for a new trial has never before been brought to this court on a division of opinion in the circuit court. United States v. Daniel, 6 Wheat. 542; 5 Cond. Rep. 170.

Rep. 79.

The defendants, Kelly and others, were indicted in the circuit court of Pennsylvania, for feloniously endeavouring to make a revolt on the high seas, on board of a merchant vessel of the United States. They were found guilty; and their counsel moved to arrest the judgment, on the ground, "that the act of Congress does not define the offence of making a revolt, and that it was not competent to the court to give a judicial definition of a crime heretofore unknown." The opinions of the judges of the circuit court were divided on this motion, and the same was certified to the supreme court. United States v. Kelly et al., 11 Wheat. 417; 6 Cond. Rep. 370.

The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, " if, on points reserved, the court should be of opinion that the law is for the plaintiff; if not, for the defendant." The opinions of the judges being opposed, the cause was removed to the supreme court, upon a certificate of disagreement upon points stated, and the special verdict. The points were, that the whole evidence and certain letters, show a subsisting and open agreement at the time of action brought; that the whole evidence constitutes a special agreement, &c.; that the plaintiff cannot recover on two items of the account, &c. The supreme court held the points imperfectly stated, and refused to give a certificate of their opinion. Perkins v. Hart's Ex'r, 11 Wheat. 237 ; 6 Cond. Rc'p. 287.

It was certified, accordingly, to the circuit court. Devereaux v. Marr, 12 Wheat. 212; 6 Cond. Rep. 522.

The judges of the circuit court being divided in opinion upon certain points, the same was certified to the supreme court. The case stated formed a part of the record sent up to the supreme court. The supreme court directed the opinion of the court to be certified on each of the points, on which the judges of the circuit court had been divided in opinion ; and which were argued before it. Schimmelpennich et al. v. Bayard et al., 1 Peters, 264.
This case came before the court on a certificate of a division of opinion between the judges of the circuit court of the southern district of New York ; the court having divided in opinion on a motion for execution, after a verdict against the sureties of a postmaster, for the plaintiff.

An action was instituted in the circuit court of Kentucky on a promissory note, by the Bank of the United States : and the defendants filed a plea, setting forth circumstances which brought up the question of usury, in the discounting of the note. The plaintiffs demurred; and the judges of the circuit court differed in opinion on the questions raised by the pleadings: 1. Whether the facts set forth in the plea, made out a case of usury. 2. Whether, if there was usury in the case, the note is invalid, so that no recovery can be had thereon. 3. Whether, if not wholly void, a part of the note can be recovered. Bank of the United States v. Owens and others, 2 Peters, 527.

The Trustees of the Sailor's Snug Harbor, 3 Peters, 99.
The questions on which the judges of the circuit court of North Carolina were opposed in opinion, arose in an action instituted against the defendant, to recover damages for neglecting to institute a suit against the indorser of a promissory note, until after the remedy was barred by the statute of limitations. The question certified to the supreme court, arose on the finding of the jury for the plaintiff, subject to the opinion of the court, whether the statute of limitations was not a bar to the plaintiff's action against the defendant. Wilcox et al. v. The Ex'rs of Plummer, 4 Peters, 172.
On inspecting the record, it was perceived that the judges of the circuit court of Rhode Island, instead of dividing on one or more points, had divided on the whole case, and had directed the whole case to be certified to the supreme court. Considering this as irregular, the supreme court directed the cause to be remanded to the circuit court, that further proceedings may be had therein according to law. Saunders v. Gould, 4 Peters, 392.

A bill was filed on the equity side of the circuit court of Virginia, and the judges were opposed in

The judges of the circuit court of North Carolina were opposed in opinion, on a question, whether the priority to which the United States are entitled in case of a general assignment made by a debtor, comprehends a bond for duties executed anterior to the assignment, but not payable until after the same.
