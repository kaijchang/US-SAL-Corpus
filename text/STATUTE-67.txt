'Aid to Week".

Korea

Whereas the people of the United States feel a strong bond of friendship toward the people of the Republic of Korea in our common fight in defense of freedom; and
Whereas Korean women, children, aged, and maimed have been subject to the ravages of war for almost three years; and
Whereas the facilities of the Government of the Republic of Korea and the magnanimous aid of private relief agencies have not to date been nearly adequate for the monumental task of rehabilitation of the millions of injured, destitute, and homeless Koreans; and
Whereas the American military forces in Korea have been so moved by the suffering of the civilians there that they have contributed millions of dollars of their own money to help these stricken people; and
Whereas recent reports estimate there are nine million dislocated persons, one hundred thousand orphans, three hundred thousand war widows, and fifteen thousand amputees in desperate need in that land which has borne such sacrifice to retain its freedom and independence and to resist Communist aggression; and
Whereas the practice of assistance through private relief agencies is in the best American tradition: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved by the /Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled^ That the President of the United States is requested and authorized to officially proclaim the week of June 7-14, 1953, as "Aid to Korea Week": And be it further

CONNECTICUT RIVER FLOOD CONTROL COMPACT

Whereas, the federal government exercises jurisdiction over the nation's navigable rivers and their tributaries through passage of the flood control act of nineteen hundred and thirty-six and various other acts amendatory thereto; and
"Whereas, these acts provide for construction by the United States of dams for flood control and, where feasible, in addition to flood control for storage of water to be used for irrigation, recreation or hydroelectric power or for any of these purposes; and
Whereas, the Connecticut is an interstate river and control of major floods on it can be obtained only by the construction of dams by the United States under authorization of the above mentioned acts; and
Whereas, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the States of Connecticut, New Hampshire and Vermont recognize that it is in the interest of their general welfare that the United States construct in the Connecticut River Valley a comprehensive system of local protection works and dams and reservoirs to control floods and prevent loss of life and property, the disruption of orderly processes and the impairment of commerce between the aforesaid states; and
Whereas, the United States has constructed dikes, flood walls and other local protection works at Hartford and East Hartford in the State of Connecticut and at Springfield, Riverdale, West Springfield, Chicopee, Northampton, Holyoke, and Springdale, in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and dams and reservoirs for the storage of flood waters at Knightville, Birch Hill and Tully in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, at Surry Mountain in the State of New Hampshire and at Union Village in the State of Vermont and has reached agreements with the state wherein located for construction of dams and reservoirs for the storage of flood waters at Barre Falls in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and at Ball Mountain and at Townshend in the State of Vermont; and
Wliereas, the Congress has at various times authorized construction by the United States of other dams and reservoirs for the storage of flood waters in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and in the States of New Hampshire and Veimont and has more recently instructed the corps of engineers to determine what additional local protection w^orks and dams and reservoirs are required for a comprehensive system to control floods in the Connecticut River and its tributaries; and
Whereas, it is believed that such a comprehensive flood control system should include dams and reservoirs controlling flood run-off from approximately twenty-five (25) per cent of the total drainage area of the Connecticut River above Hartford, Connecticut, and strategically located in reference to characteristics of tributaries and to damage centers; and
Whereas, construction by the United States of additional dams and reservoirs in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and in the States of New Hampshire and Vermont, to complete such a comprehensive

[67 STAT.

flood control system, will remove from the tax rolls of local governments of those states such property as is acquired by the United States and may work other hardships against the people of Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont; and
Whereas, it is highly desirable that any flood control dam and reservoir constructed by the United States in the Connecticut River Valley have the approval of the state w^herein it is located and that states benefiting from construction of such dam and reservoir make reimbursement for such loss of taxes and for such hardships; and
Whereas, a comprehensive system for the prevention of destructive floods and for water resources utilization in the Connecticut River Valley can best be accomplished by cooperation between the several states in the valley and by and through a common and joint agency of said several states;
Now, therefore, the said Commonwealth of Massachusetts and States of Connecticut, New Hampshire and Vermont do hereby enter into the following compact, to-wit:

ARTICLE I
The principal purposes of this compact are: (a) to promote interstate comity among and between the signatory states; (b) to assure adequate storage capacity for impounding the waters of the Connecticut River and its tributaries for the protection of life and property from floods; (c) to provide a joint or common agency through which the signatory states, while promoting, protecting and preserving to each the local interest and sovereignty of the respective signatory states, may more effectively cooperate in accomplishing the object of flood control and water resources utilization in the basin of the Connecticut River and its tributaries.

(40) per cent and the State of Vermont forty (40) per cent of the amount of taxes lost to their political subdivisions by reason of acquisition and ownership by the United States of lands, rights or other property therein for construction in the future of any flood control dam and reservoir specified in Article I V and also for any other flood control dam and reservoir hereafter constructed by the United States in the Connecticut River Valley.
Annually, not later than November first of each year, the commission shall determine the loss of taxes resulting to political subdivisions of each signatory state by reason of acquisition and ownership therein by the United States of lands, rights or other property in connection with each flood control dam and reservoir for which provision for tax reimbursement has been made in the four paragraphs next above. Such losses of taxes as determined by the commission shall be based on the tax rate then current in each such political subdivision and on the average assessed valuation for a period of five years prior to the acquisition by the United States of such property, provided that whenever a political subdivision wherein a flood control dam and reservoir or portion thereof is located shall have made a general revaluation of property subject to the annual municipal taxes of such subdivision, the commission may use such revaluation for the purpose of determining the amount of taxes for which reimbursement shall be made. Using the percentage of payment agreed to in said four paragraphs, the commission shall then compute the sum, if any, due from each signatory state to each other signatory state and shall send a notice to the treasurer of each signatory state setting forth in detail the sums, if a n j , each is to pay to and to receive from each other signatory state m reimbursement of tax losses.
Each signatory state on receipt of formal notification from the commission of the sum which it is to pay in reimbursement for tax losses, shall, not later than July first of the following year, make its payment for such tax losses to the signatory state wherein such loss or losses occur, except that in case of the first annual payment for tax losses at any dam or reservoir such payment shall be made by payor states not later than J u l y first of the year in which the next regular session of its legislature is held.
Payment by a signatory state of its share of reimbursement for taxes in accordance with formal notification received from the commission shall be a complete and final discharge of all liability by the payor state to the payee state for each flood control dam and reservoir within the payee state for the time specified in such formal notification. Each payee signatory state shall have full responsibility for distributing or expending all such sums received, and no agency or political subdivision shall have any claim against any signatory state other than the payee state, nor against the commission relative to tax losses covered by such payments.
Whenever a state which makes reimbursement for tax losses and a state which receives such reimbursement from it shall agree, through the commission, on a lump sum payment in lieu of annual payments and such lump sum payment has been made and received, the requirement that tlie commission annually shall determine the tax losses, compute sums due from each state and send notice thereof to the treasurer of each state shall no longer apply to the aforesaid states with respect to any flood control dam and reservoir for which lumpsum payment has been made and received.
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the State of Connecticut each agrees to pay its respective share in reimbursement, as determined by the commission under the procedure following, for economic losses and damages occurring by reason of ownership of property by the

50

United States for construction and operation of a flood control dam and reservoir at any site specified in Article IV, and for any other flood control dam and reservoir constructed hereafter by the United States in the Connecticut River Valley, provided, however, that no reimbursement shall be made for speculative losses and damages or losses or damages for which the United States is liable.
On receipt of information from the chief of engineers that request is to be made for funds for the purpose of preparing detailed plans and specifications for any flood control dam and reservoir proposed to be constructed in the Connecticut River Valley, including those specified in Article IV, the commission shall make an estimate of the amount of taxes which would be lost to and of economic losses and damages which would occur in political subdivisions of the signatory state wherein such dam and reservoir would be located, wholly or in part, by reason of acquisition and ownership by the United States of lands, rights or other property for the construction and operation of such flood control dam and reservoir and shall decide whether the flood control benefits to be derived in the signatory states from such flood control dam and reservoir, both by itself and as a unit of a comprehensive flood control plan, justifies, in the opinion of the commission, the assumption by signatory states of the obligation to make reimbursement for loss of taxes and for economic losses and damages. Such estimate and decision shall thereafter be reviewed by the commission at five-year intervals until such time as the United States shall have acquired title to the site of such flood control dam or plans for its construction are abandoned. The commission shall notify the governor, the members of the United States Senate and the members of the United States House of Representatives from each signatory state and the chief of engineers as to the commission's decision and as to any change in such decision.
On receipt of information from the chief of engineers that any flood control dam and reservoir is to be constructed, reconstructed, altered or used for any purpose in addition to flood control, including those flood control dams and reservoirs heretofore constructed and those specified in Article IV, the commission shall make a separate estimate of the amount of taxes which would be lost to and of economic losses and damages which would occur in political subdivisions of the signatory state wherein such dam and reservoir would be located, wholly or in part, by reason of acquisition and ownership by the United States of lands, rights or other property for the construction and operation of such dam and reservoir in excess of the estimated amount of taxes which would be lost and of the economic losses and damages which would occur if the dam were constructed and operated for flood control only and the commission shall decide the extent to which, in its opinion, the signatory states would be justified in making reimbursement for loss of taxes and for economic losses and damages in addition to reimbursement for such dam and reservoir if constructed and used for flood control only. Such estimate and decision shall thereafter be reviewed by the commission at five-year intervals until such time as such dam and reservoir shall be so constructed, reconstructed, altered or used or plans for such construction, reconstruction, alteration or use are abandoned. The commission shall notify the governor, the members of the United States Senate and the members of the United States House of Representatives from each signatory state as to the commission's decision and as to any change in such decision.
Within thirty days after acquisition by the United States of the site of any flood control dam the commission shall proceed to make a final determination of economic losses and damages occasioned by such dam

and reservoir. The commission shall not include in such determination either speculative losses and damages or losses and damages for which the United States is liable.
The commission shall compute the share of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the State of Connecticut shall each pay to the state wherein such dam and reservoir is located by multiplying the sum of such losses and damages, as previously determined, by the percentage of flood control benefits which the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the State of Connecticut each receives, in the allocation by states, of the flood control benefits resulting from the dam and reservoir.
The commission shall send a notice to the treasurer of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and to the treasurer of the State of Connecticut setting forth in detail the sum, if any, each is to pay to the state wherein such dam and reservoir is located in reimbursement for economic losses and damages and shall also send such notice to the treasurer of the state wherein such dam and reservoir is located.
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the State of Connecticut on receipt of such formal notification by the commission shall each pay its share of such economic losses or damages to the signatory states wherein such losses or damages occur. Full payment by either state of the Sinn specified in such formal notification from the commission as to the amount of economic losses and damages for which such state is to make reimbursement shall be a complete and final discharge of all liability by the payor state to the payee state for economic losses and damages for each flood control dam and reservoir within the payee state designated in such formal notification. Each payee signatory state shall have full responsibility for distributing or expending all such sums received and no agency, political subdivision, private person, partnership, firm, association or corporation shall have any claim against any signatory state other than the payee state, nor against the commission relative to such economic losses and damages.
A signatory state may, in agreement with the commission and the chief of engineers, acquire title or option to acquire title to any or all lands, rights or other property required for any flood control dam and reservoir within its boundaries and transfer such titles or options to the United States. Whenever the fair cost to said signatory state for such titles or options, as determined by the commission, is greater than the amount received therefor from the United States, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the State of Connecticut shall each pay its share of such excess cost to said signatory state, such share to be determined by the commission in accordance with procedure herein contained for determining reimbursement for economic losses and damages.
Whenever the commission shall not agree, within a reasonable time or within sixty days after a formal request from the governor of any signatory state, concerning reimbursement for loss of taxes or for economic losses and damages at any flood control dam and reservoir heretofore or hereafter constructed by the United States in the Connecticut River Valley, or concerning the extent, if any, to which reimbursement shall be made for additional loss of taxes and for additional economic losses and damages caused by construction, reconstruction, alteration or use of any such dam for purposes other than flood control, the governor of each signatory state shall designate a person from his state as a member of a board of arbitration, hereinafter called the board, and the members so designated shall choose one additional member who shall be chairman of such board. Whenever the members appointed by the governors to such board shall not agree within sixty days on such additional member of the board, the governors of such signatory states shall jointly designate the additional

insurer within twenty days after the occurrence or commencement of

any loss covered by the policy, or as soon thereafter as is reasonably

possible. Notice given by or on behalf of the insured or the bene-

ficiary to the insurer at

(insert the location

of such office as the insurer may designate for the purpose), or to any

authorized agent of the insurer, with information sufficient to identify

the insured, shall be deemed notice to the insurer.'

"In a policy providing a loss-of-time benefit which may be payable

for at least two years, an insurer may at its option insert the following

between the first and second sentences of the above provision:

" ' Subject to the qualifications set forth below, if the insured suffers

loss of time on account of disability for which indemnity may be

payable for at least two years, he shall, at least once in every six months

after having given notice of claim, give to the insurer notice of continu-

ance of said disability, except in the event of legal incapacity. The

period of six months following any filing of proof by the insured or

any payment by the insurer on account of such claim or any denial of

liability in whole or in part by the insurer shall be excluded in apply-

ing this provision. Delay in the giving of such notice shall not impair

the insured's right to any indemnity which would otherwise have

accrued during the period of six months preceding the date on which

such notice is actually given.'

" (6) A provision as follows:

" 'CLAIM FORMS : The insurer, upon receipt of a notice of claim,

will furnish to the claimant such forms as are usually furnished by it

for filing proofs of loss. If such forms are not furnished within fifteen

days after the giving of such notice the claimant shall be deemed to

have complied with the requirements of this policy as to proof of loss

upon submitting, within the time fixed in the policy for filing proofs

of loss, written proof covering the occurrence, the character and the

extent of the loss for which claim is made.'

" 'PROOFS OF Loss: Written proof of loss must be furnished to the

insurer at its said office in case of claim for loss for which this policy

provides any periodic payment contingent upon continuing loss within

ninety days after the termination of the period for which the insurer

is liable and in case of claim for any other loss within ninety days

after the date of such loss. Failure to furnish such proof within

the time required shall not invalidate nor reduce any claim if it was

not reasonably possible to give proof within such time, provided

such proof is furnished as soon as reasonably possible and in no event,

except in the absence of legal capacity, later than one year from the

time proof is otherwise required.'

"(8) A provision as follows:

" ' T I M E OF PAYMENT or CLAIMS : Indemnities payable under this

policy for any loss other than loss for which this policy provides any

periodic payment will be paid immediately upon receipt of due writ-

ten proof of such loss. Subject to due written proof of loss, all

accrued indemnities for loss for which this policy provides periodic

payment will be paid

for payment which must not be less frequently than monthly) and

any balance remaining unpaid upon the termination of liability will

be paid immediately upon receipt of due written proof.'

" 'PAYMENT OF CLAIMS : Indemnity for loss of life will be payable

in accordance with the beneficiary designation and the provisions

respecting such payment which may be prescribed herein and effective

at the time of payment. If no such designation or provision is then

effective, such indemnity shall be payable to the estate of the insured.

Any other accrued indemnities unpaid at the insured's death may,

at the option of the insurer, be paid either to such beneficiary or to

such estate. All other indemnities will be payable to the insured.'

indemnity up to an amount not exceeding $

amount which shall not exceed $1,000), to any relative by blood or

connection by marriage of the insured or beneficiary who is deemed

by the insurer to be equitably entitled thereto. Any payment made

by the insurer in good faith pursuant to this provision shall fully

discharge the insurer to the extent of such payment.

" 'Subject to any written direction of the insured in the application

or otherwise all or a portion of any indemnities provided by this

policy on account of hospital, nursing, medical, or surgical services

may, at the insurer's option and unless the insured requests otherwise

in writing not later than the time of filing proofs of such loss, be paid

directly to the hospital or person rendering such services; but it is

not required that the service be rendered by a particular hospital or

person.'

of the insured when and as often as it may reasonably require during

the pendency of a claim hereunder and to make an autopsy in case of

death where it is not forbidden by law.'

" 'LEGAL ACTIONS : No action at law or in equity shall be brought to

recover on this policy prior to the expiration of sixty days after written

proof of loss has been furnished in accordance with the requirements

reserved to the insured and the consent of the beneficiary or benefi-

this subsection, no such policy delivered or issued for delivery to any

person in the District shall contain provisions respecting the matters

set forth below unless such provisions are in the words in which the

same appear in this paragraph: Provided^ however^ That the insurer

may, at its option, use in lieu of any such provision a corresponding

provision of different wording approved by the Superintendent which

is not less favorable in any respect to the insured or the beneficiary.

Any such provision contained in the policy shall be preceded individ-

ually by the appropriate caption appearing in this paragraph or, at the option of the insurer, by such appropriate individual or group captions or subcaptions as the Superintendent may approve.
"(1) A provision as follows:
" 'CHANGE OF OCCUPATION : If the insured be injured or contract sickness after having changed his occupation to one classified by the insurer as more hazardous than that stated in this policy or while doing for compensation anything pertaining to an occupation so classified, the insurer will pay only such portion of the indemnities provided in this policy as the premium paid would have purchased at the rates and within the limits fixed by the insurer for such more hazardous occupation. If the insured changes his occupation to one classified by the insurer as less hazardous than that stated in this policy, the insurer, upon receipt of proof of such change of occupation, will reduce the premium rate accordingly, and will return the excess pro-rata unearned premium from the date of change of occupation or from the policy anniversary date immediately preceding receipt of such proof, whichever is the more recent. I n applying this provision, the classification of occupational risk and the premium rates shall be such as have been last filed by the insurer prior to the occurrence of the loss for which the insurer is liable or prior to date of proof of change in occupation with the official having supervision of insurance in the jurisdiction where the insured resided at the time this policy was issued; but if such filing was not required, then the classification of occupational risk and the premium rates shall be those last made effective by the insurer in such jurisdiction prior to the occurrence of the loss or prior to the date of proof of change in occupation.'

"(2) A provision as follows:

" 'MISSTATEMENT OF AGE : If the age of the insured has been mis-

stated, all amounts payable under this policy shall be such as the

premium paid would have purchased at the correct age.'

"(3) A provision as follows:

" 'OTHER INSURANCE IN THIS INSURER : If an accident or sickness

or accident and sickness policy or policies previously issued by the

insurer to the insured be in force concurrently herewith, making the

aggregate indemnity for

(insert type of cover-

age or coverages) in excess of $

(insert maximum limit of

indemnity or indemnities) the excess insurance shall be void and all

premiums paid for such excess shall be returned to the insured or to

his estate.'

or, in lieu thereof:

" 'Insurance effective at any one time on the insured under a like

policy or policies in this insurer is limited to the one such policy

elected by the insured, his beneficiary or his estate, as the case may

be, and the insurer will return all premiums paid for all other such

policies.'

"(4) A provision as follows:

" 'INSURANCE W I T H OTHER INSURERS : If there be other valid cover-

age, not with this insurer, providing benefits for the same loss on a

provision of service basis or on an expense incurred basis and of which

this insurer has not been given written notice prior to the occurrence

or commencement of loss, the only liability under any expense incurred

coverage of this policy shall be for such proportion of the loss as the

amount which would otherwise have been payable hereunder plus the

total of the like amounts under all such other valid coverages for the

same loss of which this insurer had notice bears to the total like

amounts under all valid coverages for such loss, and for the return

of such portion of the premiums paid as shall exceed the pro rata

portion for the amount so determined. For the purpose of applying this provision when other coverage is on a provision of service basis, the "like amount" of such other coverage shall be taken as the amount which the services rendered would have cost in the absence of such coverage.'
"(If the foregoing policy provision is included in a policy which also contains the next following policy provision there shall be added to the caption of the foregoing provision the phrase '--EXPENSE INCURRED BENEFITS'. The insurer may, at its option, include in this provision a definition of 'other valid coverage', approved as to form by the Superintendent, which definition shall be limited in subject matter to coverage provided by organizations subject to regulation by insurance law or by insurance authorities of this or any other jurisdiction of the United States or any province of Canada, and by hospital or medical service organizations, and to any other coverage the inclusion of which may be approved by the Superintendent. In the absence of such definition such term shall not include group insurance, automobile medical payments insurance, or coverage provided by hospital or medical service organizations or by union welfare plans or employer or employee benefit organizations. For the purpose of applying the foregoing policy provision with respect to any insured, any amount of benefit provided for such insured pursuant to any compulsory benefit statute (including any workmen's compensation or employer's liability statute) whether provided by a governmental agency or otherwise shall in all cases be deemed to be 'other valid coverage' of which the insurer has had notice. In applying the foregoing policy provision no third party liability coverage shall be included as 'other valid coverage'.)
"(5) A provision as follows: " 'INSURANCE W I T H OTHER INSURERS : If there be other valid coverage, not with this insurer, providing benefits for the same loss on other than an expense-incurred basis and of which this insurer has not been given written notice prior to the occurrence or commencement of loss, the only liability for such benefits under this policy shall be for such proportion of the indemnities otherwise provided hereunder for such loss as the like indemnities of which the insurer had notice (including the indemnities under this policy) bear to the total amount of all like indemnities for such loss, and for the return of such portion of the premium paid as shall exceed the pro-rata portion for the indemnities thus determined.'
"(If the foregoing policy provision is included in a policy which also contains the next preceding policy provision there shall be added to the caption of the foregoing provision the phrase '--OTHER BENEFITS'.

" (6) A provision as follows: " 'RELATION OF EARNINGS TO INSURANCE : If the total monthly amount of loss-of-time benefits promised for the same loss under all valid loss-of-time coverage upon the insured, whether payable on a weekly or monthly basis, shall exceed the monthly earnings of the insured at the time disability commenced or his average monthly earnings for the period of two years immediately preceding a disability for which claim is made, whichever is the greater, the insurer will be liable only for such proportionate amount of such benefits under this policy as the amount of such monthly earnings or such average monthly earnings of the insured bears to the total amount of monthly benefits for the same loss under all such coverage upon the insured at the time such disability commences and for the return of such part of the premiums paid during such two years as shall exceed the pro rata amount of the premiums for the benefits actually paid hereunder; but this shall not operate to reduce the total monthly amount of benefits payable under all such coverage upon the insured below the sum of two hundred dollars or the sum of the monthly benefits specified in such coverages, whichever is the lesser, nor shall it operate to reduce benefits other than those payable for loss of time.'
"(The foregoing policy provision may be inserted only in a policy which the insured has the right to continue in force subject to its terms by the timely payment of premiums (1) until at least age 50 or, (2) in the case of a policy issued after age 44, for at least five years from its date of issue. The insurer may, at its option, include in this provision a definition of 'valid loss-of-time coverage', approved as to form by the Superintendent, which definition shall be limited in subject matter to coverage provided by governmental agencies or by organizations subject to regulation by insurance law or by insurance authorities of this or any other jurisdiction of the United States or any province of Canada, or to any other coverage the inclusion of which may be approved by the Superintendent or any combination of such coverages. In the absence of such definition such term shall not include any coverage provided for such insured pursuant to any compulsory benefit statute (including any workmen's compensation or employer's liability statute), or benefits provided by union welfare plans or by employer or employee benefit organizations.)
"(7) A provision as follows: " 'UNPAID PREMIUM : Upon the payment of a claim under this policy, any premium then due and unpaid or covered by any note or written order may be deducted therefrom.' " (8) A provision as follows: " 'CANCELLATION : The insurer may cancel this policy at any time by written notice delivered to the insured, or mailed to his last address as shown by the records of the insurer, stating when, not less than five days thereafter, such cancellation shall be effective; and after the policy has been continued beyond its original term the insured may cancel this policy at any time by written notice delivered or mailed to the insurer, effective upon receipt or on such later date as may be specified in such notice. In the event of cancellation, the insurer will return promptly the unearned portion of any premium paid. If the insured cancels, the earned premium shall be computed by the use of the short-rate table last filed with the official having supervision of insurance in the jurisdiction where the insured resided when the policy was issued. If the insurer cancels, the earned premium shall be computed pro rata. Cancellation shall be without prejudice to any claim originating prior to the effective date of cancellation.'

" ( d ) Order of certain policy provisions: The provisions which are the subject of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection, or any corresponding provisions which are used in lieu thereof in accordance with such paragraphs, shall be printed in the consecutive order of the provisions in such paragraphs or, at the option of the insurer, any such provision may appear as a unit in any part of the policy, with other provisions to which it may be logically related, provided the resulting policy shall not be in whole or in part unintelligible, uncertain, ambiguous, abstruse, or likely to mislead a person to whom the policy is offered, delivered, or issued. "(e) Third party ownership: The word 'insured', as used in this section, shall not be construed as preventing a person other than the insured with a proper insurable interest from making application for and owning a policy covering the insured or from being entitled under such a policy to any indemnities, benefits and rights provided therein. "(f) Filing procedure: The Superintendent may make such reasonable rules and regulations concerning the procedure for the filing or submission of policies subject to this section as are necessary, proper or advisable to the administration of this section. This provision shall not abridge any other authority granted the Superintendent by law.

Eortion thereof, less favorable in any respect to the insured or the eneficiary than the provisions thereof which are subject to this section.
"(b) Policy conflicting with this section: A policy delivered or issued for delivery to any person in the District in violation of this section shall be held valid but shall be construed as provided in this section.

"e. NOTICE; WAIVER
"The acknowledgment by any insurer of the receipt of notice given under any policy covered by this section, or the furnishing of forms for filing proofs of loss, or the acceptance of such proofs, or the investigation of any claim thereunder shall not operate as a waiver of any of the rights of the insurer in defense of any claim arising under such policy.

TITLE II

Small Business Act of 1953.
Policy of C ongress.

SEC. 201. This title may be cited as the "Small Business Act of 1953".
SEC. 202. The essence of the American economic system of private enterprise is free competition. Only through full and free competition can free markets, free entry into business, and opportunities for the expression and growth of personal initiative and individual judgment be assured. The preservation and expansion of such competition is basic not only to the economic well-being but to the security of this Nation. Such security and well-being cannot be realized unless the actual and potential capacity of small business is encouraged and developed. I t is the declared policy of the Congress that the Government should aid, counsel, assist, and protect insofar as is possible the interests of small-business concerns in order to preserve free competitive enterprise, to insure that a fair proportion of the total purchases and contracts for supplies and services for the Government be placed with small-business enterprises, and to maintain and strengthen the overall economy of the Nation.

SEC. 4. I n order that those persons who produce or who plan to produce under purchase programs established pursuant to Public Law 774 (Eighty-first Congress) and Public Law 96 (Eighty-second Congress) may be in position to plan their investment and production with due regard to requirements, the responsible agencies controlling such purchase programs are directed to publish at the end of each calendar quarter the amounts of each of the ores and concentrates referred to in section 3 purchased in that quarter and the total amounts of each which have been purchased under the program.

The Constitution and laws and civil and political jurisdiction of the United States are hereby extended to the subsoil and seabed of the outer Continental Shelf and to all artificial islands and fixed structures which may be erected thereon for the purpose of exploring for, developing, removing, and transporting resources therefrom, to the same extent as if the outer Continental Shelf were an area of exclusive Federal jurisdiction located within a State: Provided, however, That mineral leases on the outer Continental Shelf shall be maintained or issued only under the provisions of this Act.
(2) To the extent that they are applicable and not inconsistent with this Act or with other Federal laws and regulations of the Secretary now^ in effect or hereafter adopted, the civil and criminal laws of each adjacent State as of the effective date of this Act are hereby declared to be the law of the United States for that portion of the subsoil and seabed of the outer Continental Shelf, and artificial islands and fixed structures erected thereon, which would be within the area of the State if its boundaries w^ere extended seaward to the outer margin of the outer Continental Shelf, and the President shall determine and publish in the Federal Register such projected lines extending seaward and defining each such area. All of such applicable law^s shall be administered and enforced by the appropriate officers and courts of the United States. State taxation laws shall not apply to the outer Continental Shelf.

(f) The authority of the Secretary of the Army to prevent obstruction to navigation in the navigable waters of the United States is hereby extended to artificial islands and fixed structures located on the outer Continental Shelf.
(g) The specific application by this section of certain provisions of law to the subsoil and seabed of the outer Continental Shelf and the artificial islands and fixed structures referred to in subsection (a) or to acts or offenses occurring or committed thereon shall not give rise to any inference that the application to such islands and structures, acts, or offenses of any other provision of law is not intended.

The issuance and continuance in effect of any lease, or of any extension, renewal, or replacement of any lease under the provisions of this Act shall be conditioned upon compliance with the regulations issued under this Act and in force and effect on the date of the issuance of the lease if the lease is issued under the provisions of section 8 hereof, or with the regulations issued under the provisions of section 6 ( b ) , clause ( 2 ) , hereof if the lease is maintained under the provisions of section 6 hereof.
(b) (1) Whenever the owner of a nonproducing lease fails to comply with any of the provisions of this Act, or of the lease, or of the regulations issued under this Act and in force and effect on the date of the issuance of the lease if the lease is issued under the provisions of section 8 hereof, or of the regulations issued under the provisions of section 6 (b), clause (2), hereof, if the lease is maintained under the provisions of section 6 hereof, such lease may be canceled by the Secretary, subject to the right of judicial review as provided in section 8 (j), if such default continues for the period of thirty days after mailing of notice by registered letter to the lease owner at his record post office address.

Failure to comply with the provisions of this section or the regulations and conditions prescribed thereunder shall be ground for forfeiture of the grant in an appropriate judicial proceeding instituted by the United States in any United States district court having jurisdiction under the provisions of section 4 (b) of this Act.
SEC. 6. MAINTENANCE OF LEASES ON OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF.--
(a) The provisions of this section shall apply to any mineral lease covering submerged lands of the outer Continental Shelf issued by any State (including any extension, renewal, or replacement thereof heretofore granted pursuant to such lease or under the laws of such State)

"(c) (1) The amount to which a local educational agency is entitled under this section for any fiscal year ending prior to July 1, 1956, shall be an amount equal to (A) the local contribution rate (determined under subsection ( d ) ) multiplied by (B) the sum of the number of children determined under subsection (a) and one-half of the number determined under subsection (b), minus 3 per centum of the difference between such sum and the total number of children who were in average daily attendance at the schools of such agency, and for whom such agency provided free public education, during the preceding fiscal year; except that no local educational agency shall be entitled to any payment under this section for any fiscal year unless the sum of the number of children determined under subsection (a) and one-half of the number of children determined under subsection (b) is ten or more. Notwithstanding the foregoing jprovisions of this paragraph, whenever and to the extent that, in his judgment, exceptional circumstances exist which make such action necessary to avoid inequity and avoid defeating the purposes of this Act, the Commissioner may waive or reduce the 3 per centum deduction, or the requirement of ten or more children, contained in this paragraph, or both.

all children in average daily attendance at the schools of such agency during the preceding fiscal year; and
"(2) that such activities of the United States have placed on such agency a substantial and continuing financial burden; and
"(3) that such agency is making a reasonable tax effort and is exercising due diligence in availing itself of State and other financial assistance but is unable to secure sufficient funds to meet the increased educational costs involved, then such agency shall be entitled to receive for such fiscal year an amount equal to the product of--
" ( A ) the number of children which the Commissioner determines to be the increase, so resulting from activities of the United States, in such year in average daily attendance; and

For the next fiscal year (except where the determination under the preceding sentence has been made with respect to the fiscal year ending J u n e 30, 1956) such agency shall be entitled to receive 50 per centum of such product, but not to exceed for such year the amount which the Commissioner determines to be necessary to enable such agency, with the State, local, and other Federal funds available to it for such purpose, to provide a level of education equivalent to that maintained in the school districts in such State which in his judgment are generally comparable to the school district of such agency. The determinations whether an increase has occurred for purposes of clause (1) hereof and whether such increase meets the 5 per centum requirement contained in such clause, for any fiscal year, shall be made on the basis of estimates by the Commissioner made prior to the close of such year, except that an underestimate made by the Commissioner pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this sentence shall not operate to deprive an agency of its entitlement to any payments under this section to which it would be entitled had the estimate been accurate. The determination under clause (B) shall be made by the Commissioner after considering the current expenditures per child in providing free public education in those school districts in the State which, in the judgment of the Commissioner, are generally comparable to the school district of the local educational agency for which the computation is being made."

ARTICLE I
FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS
1. The States of New Jersey and New York hereby find and declare that the conditions under which waterfront labor is employed within the Port of New York district are depressing and degrading to such labor, resulting from the lack of any systematic method of hiring, the lack of adequate information as to the availability of employment, corrupt hiring practices and the fact that persons conducting such hiring are frequently criminals and persons notoriously lacking in moral character and integrity and neither responsive or responsible to the employers nor to the uncoerced will of the majority of the members of the labor organizations of the employees; that as a result waterfront laborers suffer from irregularity of employment, fear and insecurity, inadequate earnings, an unduly high accident rate, subjection to borrowing at usurious rates of interest, exploitation and extortion as the price of securing employment and a loss of respect for the law; that not only does there result a destruction of the dignity of an important segment of American labor, but a direct encouragement of crime which imposes a levy of greatly increased costs on food, fuel and other necessaries handled in and through the Port of New York district.
2. The States of New Jersey and New York hereby find and declare that many of the evils above described result not only from the causes above described but from the practices of public loaders at piers and other waterfront terminals; that such public loaders serve no valid economic purpose and operate as parasites exacting a high and unwarranted toll on the flow of commerce in and through the Port of New York district, and have used force and engaged in discriminatory and coercive practices including extortion against persons not desiring to employ them; and that the function of loading and unloading trucks and other land vehicles at piers and other waterfront terminals can and should be performed, as in every other major American port, without the evils and abuses of the public loader system, and by the carriers of freight by water, stevedores and operators of such piers and other waterfront terminals or the operators of such trucks or other land vehicles.

[67 S T A T .

3. The States of New Jersey and New York hereby find and declare that many of the evils above described result not only from the causes above described but from the lack of regulation of the occupation of stevedores; that such stevedores have engaged in corrupt practices to induce their hire by carriers of freight by water and to induce officers and representatives of labor organizations to betray their trust to the members of such labor organizations.
4. The States of New Jersey and New York hereby find and declare that the occupations of longshoremen, stevedores, pier superintendents, hiring agents and port watchmen are affected with a public interest requiring their regulation and that such regulation shall be deemed an exercise of the police power of the two States for the protection of the public safety, welfare, prosperity, health, peace and living conditions of the people of the two States.

ARTICLE II
DEFINITIONS
As used in this compact: "The Port of New York district" shall mean the district created by Article I I of the compact dated April thirtieth, one thousand nine hundred and twenty-one, between the States of New York and New Jersey, authorized by chapter one hundred fifty-four of the laws of New York of one thousand and nine hundred and twenty-one and chapter one hundred fifty-one of the laws of New Jersey of one thousand nine hundred and twenty-one.

I t is the sense of the Legislatures of the States of New York and New Jersey that these practices and conditions must be eliminated to prevent grave injury to the welfare of the people.
2. I t is hereby declared to be against the public policy of the States of New Jersey and New York and to be unlawful for any person to load or unload waterborne freight onto or from vehicles other than railroad cars at piers or at other waterfront terminals within the port of New York district, for a fee or other compensation, other than the following persons and their employees:

(e) Stevedores licenses under article VI, whether or not such waterborne freight has been or is to be transported by a carrier of freight by water with which such stevedore shall have a contract of the type prescribed by subdivision (d) of section 3 of article V I .
Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to permit any such loading or unloading of any w^aterborne freight at any place by any such person by means of any independent contractor, or any other agent other than an employee, unless such independent contractor is a person permitted by this article to load or unload such freight at such place in his own right.

ARTICLE XII

EMPLOYMENT INFORMATION CENTERS
1. The States of New Jersey and New York hereby find and declare that the method of employment of longshoremen and port watchmen in the Port of New York district, commonly known as the "shape-up," has resulted in vicious and notorious abuses, of which such employees have been the principal victims. There is compelling evidence that the "shape-up" has permitted and encouraged extortion from employees as the price of securing or retaining employment and has subjected such employees to threats of violence, unwilling joinder in unauthorized labor disturbances and criminal activities on the waterfront. The "shape-up" has thus resulted in a loss of fundamental rights and liberties of labor, has impaired the economic stability of the Port of New York district and weakened law enforcement therein. I t is the sense of the Legislatures of the States of New Jersey and New

67 S T A T . ]

PUBLIC LAW 252-AUG. 12, 1958

555

York that these practices and conditions must be eliminated to prevent grave injury to the welfare of waterfront laborers and to the people at large and that the elimination of the "shape-iip" and the establishment of a system of employment information centers are necessary to a solution of these public problems,
2. The commission shall establish and maintain one or more employment information centers in each State within the Port of New York district at such locations as it may determine. No person shall, directly or indirectly, hire any person for w^ork as a longshoreman or port watchman within the Port of New York district, except through such particular employment information center or centers as may be prescribed by the commission. No person shall accept any employment as a longshoreman or port watchman within the Port of New York district, except through such an employment information center. At each such employment information center the commission shall keep and exhibit the longshoremen's register and any other records it shall determine to the end that longshoremen and port watchmen shall have the maximum information as to available employment as such at any time within the Port of New York district and to the end that employers shall have an adequate opportunity to fill their requirements of registered longshoremen and port watchmen at all times.
3. Every employer of longshoremen or port watchmen within the Port of New York district shall furnish such information as may be required by the rules and regulations prescribed by the commission with regard to the name of each person hired as a longshoreman or port watchman, the time and place of hiring, the time, place and hours of work, and the compensation therefor.
4. All wage payments to longshoremen or port watchmen for work as such shall be made by check or cash evidenced by a written voucher receipted by the person to whom such cash is paid. The commission may arrange for the provision of facilities for cashing such checks.

ARTICLE X I I I
EXPENSES o r ADMINISTRATION
1. By concurrent legislation enacted by their respective Legislatures, the two States may provide from time to time for meeting the commission's expenses. Until other provision shall be made, such expense shall be met as authorized in this article.
2. The commission shall annually adopt a budget of its expenses for each year. Each budget shall be submitted to the Governors of the two States and shall take effect as submitted; provided^ that either Governor may within thirty days disapprove or reduce any item or items, and the budget shall be adjusted accordingly.
3. After taking into account such funds as may be available to it from reserves. Federal grants or otherwise, the balance of the commission's budgeted expenses shall be assessed upon employers of persons registered or licensed under this compact. Each such employer shall pay to the commission an assessment computed upon the gross payroll payments made by such employer to longshoremen, pier superintendents, hiring agents and port watchmen for work or labor performed within the port of New York district, at a rate, not in excess of two per cent, computed by the commission in the following manner: the commission shall annually estimate the gross payroll payments to be made by employers subject to assessment and shall compute a rate thereon which will yield revenues sufficient to finance the commission's budget for each year. Such budget may include a reasonable amount for a reserve but such amount shall not exceed ten per cent of the total of all other items of expenditure contained

556

[67 S T A T .

therein. Such reserve shall be used for the stabilization of annual assessments, the payment of operating deficits and for the repayment of advances made by the two States.
4. The amount required to balance the commission's budget, in excess of the estimated yield of the maximum assessment, shall be certified by the commission, with the approval of the respective Governors, to the Legislatures of the two States, in proportion to the gross annual wage payments made to longshoremen for work in each State within the port of New York district. The Legislatures shall annually appropriate to the commission the amount so certified.
5. The commission may provide by regulation for the collection and auditing of assessments. Such assessments hereunder shall be payable pursuant to such provisions for administration, collection and enforcement as the States may provide by concurrent legislation.

Evaluation.

STATEMENT OF PURPOSE AND POLICY

Eesearch and experimentation in the field of weather modification and control have attained the stage at which the application of scientific advances in this field appears to be practical.
The effect of the use of measures for the control of weather phenomena upon the social, economic, and political structures of today, and upon national security, cannot now be determined. I t is a field in which unknown factors are involved. It is reasonable to anticipate, however, that modification and control of weather, if effective on a large scale, would cause profound changes in our present way of life and would result in vast and far-reaching benefits to agriculture, industry, commerce, and the general welfare and common defense.
While the ultimate extent to which weather modification and control may be utilized is speculative, the application of such measures without proper safeguards, sufficient data and accurate information may result in inadequate or excessive precipitation; may cause catastrophic droughts, storms, floods, and other phenomena with consequent loss of life and property, injury to navigable streams and other channels of interstate and foreign commerce, injury to water supplies for municipal, irrigation, and industrial purposes, and injury to sources of hydroelectric power; may otherwise impede the production and transportation of goods and services for domestic consumption and export and for the national defense; and may otherwise adversely affect the general welfare and common defense.
Thorough experimentation and full-scale operations in weather modification and control will of necessity affect areas extending across State and possibly across national boundaries. The Congress, therefore, recognizes that experimentation and application of such measures are matters of national and international concern.
Accordingly, it is hereby declared to be the policy of the Congress, in order to effect the maximum benefit which may result from experiments and operations designed to modify and control weather, to correlate and evaluate the information derived from such activity and to cooperate with the several States and the duly authorized officials thereof with respect to such activity, all to the end of encouraging the intelligent experimentation 9,nd the beneficial development of weather modification and control, preventing its harmful and indiscriminate exercise, and fostering sound economic conditions in the public interest.

CREATION OF ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON WEATHER CONTROL

SEC. 2. There is hereby established a national committee to be known as the Advisory Committee on Weather Control (hereinafter called the "Committee").
SEC. 3. The Committee shall make a complete study and evaluation of public and private experiments in weather control for the'purpose of determining the extent to which the United States should experiment with, engage in, or regulate activities designed to control weather conditions.

He shall be given credit under the homestead law^s for residence, improvement, and cultivation made or performed upon the original entry, and if satisfactory final proof of residence, improvement, and cultivation has been made on the original entry it shall not be necessary to submit such proof upon the lieu entry Rights under this Act shall not be assignable.
SEC. 2. The benefits of section 1 of this Act shall, and those of the following sections may, be extended by the Secretary to (a) any lawful assignee of an unpatented farm unit on a Federal irrigation project who took the assignment in good faith not knowing and not having reason to believe the farm unit to be insufficient to support a family; and (b) any resident owner of private lands on any such project whose lands shall be found to be insufficient to support a family and (i) who, apart from his ownership of the lands to be conveyed pursuant to clause (iii) hereof and apart from his having previously exhausted his homestead right, if such be the case, is eligible to enter unappropriated public lands under Revised Statutes, section 2289, as amended (43 U. S. C. 161), (ii) who lawfully acquired his lands as an entire farm unit under the Federal reclamation laws from the United States or, in the case of a widow, widower, heir, or devisee, from a spouse or ancestor, as the case may be, who so acquired them, and (iii) who conveys, free from all encumbrances, to tTie United States all of his lands served by the project or such portion thereof as the Secretary may designate.
SEC. 3. (a) If an entryman making an exchange under the provisions of this Act becomes the direct obligor for payment to the United States of irrigation construction charges for his lieu farm unit or undertakes a contract under which the equivalent, in whole or in part, of such charges is returned to the United States, the Secretary, to the extent to which such charges upon the original farm unit or the equivalent thereof have actually been paid to the United States or to an irrigation district or other form of organization under contract with the United States, may give him credit for such charges upon the lieu unit.
(b) If an irrigation district or other form of organization within the boundaries of which is located the lieu farm unit of an entryman making an exchange under the provisions of this Act is or becomes the direct obligor for payment to the United States of irrigation construction charges or undertakes or has undertaken a contract under which the equivalent, in whole or in part, of such charges is returned to the United States, the Secretary may, to the extent to which it gives credit to the entryman for such charges or the equivalent thereof actually paid upon the original farm unit, give the district or other form of organization credit for payment of such charges.

SEC. 4. (a) After his approval of any application for an exchange as provided in this Act, the Secretary may cancel and release, in whole or in part, any and all charges or liens against the entryman or against the relinquished farm unit which are within his administrative jurisdiction.

INDIANS
Whereas it is the policy of Congress, as rapidly as possible, to make the Indians within the territorial limits of the United States subject to the same laws and entitled to the same privileges and responsibilities as are applicable to other citizens of the United States, to end their status as wards of the United States, and to grant them all of the rights and prerogatives pertaining to American citizenship ; and
Whereas the Indians within the territorial limits of the United States should assume their full responsibilities as American citizens: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved hy the House vf Representatives {the Senate concurring), That it is declared to be the sense of Congress that, at the earliest possible time, all of the Indian tribes and the individual members thereof located within the States of California, Florida, New York, and Texas, and all of the following named Indian tribes and individual members thereof, should be freed from Federal supervision and control and from all disabilities and limitations specially applicable to Indians: The Flathead Tribe of Montana, the Klamath Tribe of Oregon, the Menominee Tribe of Wisconsin, the Potowatamie Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska, and those members of the Chippewa Tribe who are on the Turtle Mountain Reservation, North Dakota. It is further declared to be the sense of Congress that, upon the release of such tribes and individual members thereof from such disabilities and limitations, all offices of the Bureau of Indian Affairs in the States of California, Florida, New York, and Texas and all other offices of the Bureau of Indian Affairs whose primary purpose was to serve any Indian tribe or individual Indian freed from Federal supervision should be abolished. It is further declared to be the sense of Congress that the Secretary of the Interior should examine all existing legislation dealing with such Indians, and treaties between the Government of the United States and each such tribe, and report to Congress at the earliest practicable date, but not later than January 1, 1954, his recommendations for such legislation as, in his judgment, may be necessary to accomplish the purposes of this resolution.

EAST GERMANY: FRIENDSHIP AND SYMPATHY
OF AMERICAN PEOPLE Whereas the brutal suppression by the Soviet Communist regime
through the use of armed force and police terror of workers seeking the rights of free assembly and other rights assured to all in the free world; the persecutions of members of all religious faiths; the continuing servitude enforced upon the captive peoples; the systematic repression of all non-Communist political elements in the Soviet-dominated countries and most recently the acts against the people of Soviet-dominated countries, deserves strongest condemnation; and constitute (a) suppression of individual and human rights, and (b) persecution on account of race and religion; (c) violate the declarations in the Preamble to the Charter of the United Nations; and (d) violate the basic principles set forth in the American Declaration of Independence of 1776: "* * * that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator

with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,--That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. * * * But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security."; and Whereas the people of East Berlin, East Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Rumania, Hungary and other Communist-dominated countries have so courageously demonstrated their strong devotion to these principles of freedom and justice by their heroic resistance to the Soviet-controlled East German regime and mindful that the United States secured its freedom by popular revolt against tyranny; and Whereas the Soviet regime being unable to win the allegiance of the people under its rule, knows no other method of achieving the compliance of the people to their dictatorship than by force of arms, terror, murder, imprisonment, reprisals and mass deportation; and Whereas the cause of freedom cannot be contained and will eventually triumph: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Congress commends and encourages the valiant C_oEnxgprreessss. ions of struggle of these captive peoples for freedom.
SEC. 2. I t is further the sense of the Congress that the United States express in the United Nations and in every other way open to it the indignation of its people against these suppressions of workers and religious persecutions in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the Communist satellites, its sympathy with the tragic victims of these suppressions and religious persecutions, and its determination that international law and individual and human rights be observed in the world.
SEC. 3. That the Congress of the United States in behalf of the American people hereby expresses the firm conviction that the people of East Germany are entitled to their basic, inalienable God-given rights and freedoms for which they are now struggling.
SEC. 4. That the Congress of the United States further expresses the firm conviction of the American people that the people of Germany, now presently divided, have the right to be a unified nation governed by their own consent by the free expression of popular will in free elections.
SEC. 5. That the Congress of the United States further expresses in behalf of the American people its friendship and sympathy with the people of East Germany, particularly those who have suffered at the hands of the Communists because of their patriotic defiance of Communist tyranny and denounces the action of the Communist regime in killing, imprisoning, and deporting those who have openly demonstrated their love of liberty and justice, and asserts that their heroic sacrifice and suffering will aid the cause of freedom in all the Communist enslaved nations and will inspire freedom loving people everywhere.

1. WHEREAS, pursuant to section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as added by section 31 of the act of August 24, 1935, 49 Stat. 773, reenacted by section 1 of the act of June 3, 1937, 50 Stat. 246, and amended by section 3 of the act of July 3, 1948, 62 Stat. 1248, and section 3 of the act of June 28, 1950, 64 Stat. 261 (7 U. S. C. 624), I caused the United States Tariff Commission to make an investigation to determine whether certain tree nuts are being or are practically certain to be imported into the United States under such conditions and in such quantities as to render or tend to render ineffective, or materially interfere with, certain programs or operations undertaken by the Department of Agriculture with respect to such nuts, or to reduce substantially the amount of any product processed in the United States from such nuts with respect to which any such program or operation is being undertaken; and
2. WHEREAS the Commission instituted such investigation on April 13, 1950, and on November 24, 1950 reported to me that there was at that time no basis for any action under the said section 22 with respect to imports of such nuts, but that it was continuing the investigation; and
3. WHEREAS, after further investigation, including a public hearing, the Commission, on November 28, 1951, reported to me regarding the need for action under the said section 22 in order to protect the programs of the United States Department of Agriculture
for the crop year 1951-52 with respect to almonds, pecans, filberts, and walnuts, in which report the Commission found that the imposition of a specified fee on imports of shelled almonds and of blanched, roasted, or otherwise prepared or preserved almonds (not including almond paste) entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption during the period October 1, 1951 to September 30, 1952, inclusive, in excess of a specified aggregate quantity, was necessary to prevent imports of such almonds from rendering ineffective or materially interfering with the program undertaken by the Department of Agriculture with respect to almonds; and
4. WHEREAS, in accordance with the Commission's recommendation in the said report of November 28, 1951, on December 10, 1951 I issued a proclamation pursuant to the said section 22 imposing a fee on imports of shelled almonds and on blanched, roasted, or otherwise prepared or preserved almonds entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption during the period October 1, 1951 to September 30, 1952, inclusive, in excess of a certain aggregate quantity, as specified in the Commission's recommendation; and

1937, as amended; and 8. W H E R E A S I find and declare that the imposition of the fees
hereinafter proclaimed are shown by such investigation of the Commission to be necessary in order that the entry of imported shelled almonds, blanched, roasted, or otherwise prepared or preserved almonds (not including almond paste) will not render or tend to render ineffective, or materially interfere with, the said program undertaken by the Department of Agriculture with respect to almonds:
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, H A R R Y S. T R U M A N , President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the said section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment ^p^^ g^g amended, do hereby proclaim:

It is to defend and safeguard these same freedoms that the United Nations is resisting communist aggression in Korea, and is seeking to promote the liberty and security of all peoples.
In this celebration let us join with the peoples of the other free nations of the world in recognition of our common purpose to defend and further the rights and freedoms of all people as proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and in so doing renew our determination that here in our own land the great guarantees in our Bills of Rights shall not be lost or weakened or curtailed.

A PROCLAMATION

Fire Prevention Week, 1953.

W H E R E A S during the past year fire has taken the Hves of some 10,000 of our people and has permanently maimed countless others; and
W H E R E A S the destruction of property by fire has risen to the highest peak in many years, resulting in a monetary loss of nearly a billion dollars; and
W H E R E A S the conservation of lives, property, and natural resources is a matter of the utmost importance to our Nation; and
W H E R E A S it has been abundantly demonstrated that fire losses can be substantially reduced wherever people are awakened to the danger:
NOW, THEREFORE, I, DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning October 4, 1953, as Fire Prevention Week.
I earnestly request all our citizens, during that week, to initiate a year-round campaign in their homes and in their communities against the needless waste of life and property caused by destructive fires. I urge that State and local governments, the American National Red Cross, the National Fire Waste Council, the Chamber of Commerce of the United States, and business, labor, and farm organizations, as well as schools, civic groups, and agencies of public information-- including newspapers, magazines, and the radio, television, and motion picture industries--cooperate fully in the observance of Fire Prevention Week. I also direct the appropriate agencies of the Federal Government to assist in this crusade against the loss of life and property resulting from fires.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
D O N E a t the City of Washington this 31st day of July in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-three, and of the
[SEAL] Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-eighth. DWIGHT D EISENHOWER
By the President:
JOHN FOSTER DULLES
Secretary of State
