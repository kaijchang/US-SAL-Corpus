And such persons who are entitled to purchase said lands as aforesaid shall be permitted to make payment therefor in cash or in three equal annual installments, the first installment to be payable on the day of the entry of the land, and the remaining two installments annually thereafter, with interest at the rate of six per centum per annum from the date of entry.

11 To the Senate and House ofRepresentatives of the United States ofAmerica in Congress assembled;
The memorial of Doctor Joseph Merideth Toner, of the City of Washington, in the District of Columbia, respectfully shows to your honorable bodies, that he is the owner of a large and valuable collection of books and pamphlets, about twenty thousand volumes or upwards in number, treating of medical, scientific, historical, biographical, literary, and miscellaneous subjects, and many of which are very rare and of great interest; and desiring that said collection of books, to the accumulation of which your memorialist has devoted considerable funds and a large part of his life, should be permanently preserved and placed where it would be most beneficial to the cause of science and most advantageous to the public, he respectfully offers the said collection to the United States of America, to be placed in the National Library of the United States at the city of Washington, under the management and control of the Librarian of Congress, upon the terms aud conditions following, which he deems to be reasonable and just, and which he trusts will prove acceptable to your honorable bodies; namely:
First. That the collection should be kept separate and apart from the other books and pamphlets in the Library, in separate rooms or alcoves, and that it should be known and distinguished as " The Toner Collection."
Second.--That the collection of books and pamphlets be bound, when requiring it, in a uniform and substantial manner, and have placed upon the back of each a parchment band to distinguish them, and that a device distinctive of the donation be stamped upon the title page of each, and that they be kept accessible for reference, and be catalogued as speedily as practicable, and when they appear by title in the printed catalogue of the Library that some letter or symbol indicative of the collection be used, and that the condition and growth of the collection be made a matter of record in each annual report by the Librarian of Congress.
Third, That the collection be kept and used mainly for reference, and be consulted subject to the rules governing the use of rare books, and be called upon for service only when no other copy of a book or pamphlet asked for is available, and not be taken out of the Library except for special reasons.
Fourth, That your memorialist should be permitted to make additions to the collection from time to time as he may desire, upon the same terms as herein specified; and that he have liberty to insure the perpetual increase and improvement of the collection by the establishment of a trust-fund for the purpose.
Your memorialist, while desiring to perpetuate his name in connection with the donation which he here proposes to make, believes that the " Toner Collection " will prove useful and valuable to the country, and will involve no unusual expense upon the part of the United States.

Surrender of fugitive.

Requisitions for the surrender of
fugitives from justice shall be made by the respective diplomatic agents of the contracting parlies, or, in the event of the absence of these from the country or its seat of government, they may be made by superior consular officers.
If the person whose extradition may be asked for shall have been convicted of a crime or offence, a copy of the sentence of the court in which he may have been convicted, authenticated under its seal, and attestation of the official character of the judge by the proper executive authority, and of the latter by the minister or consul of the United States or of Belgium, respectively, shall accompany the requisition. When, however, the fugitive shall have been merely charged with crime, a duly authenticated copy of the warrant for his arrest in the country where the crime may have been committed, and of the depositions upon which such warrant may have been issued, must accompany the requisition as afore-
said. The President of the United
States, or the proper executive authority in Belgium, may then issue a warrant for the apprehension of the fugitive, in order that he may be brought before the proper judicial authority for examination. If
it should then be decided that, according to the law and the evidence, the extradition is due pursuant to the treaty, the fugitive may be given up according to the forms prescribed in such cases.

Whereas it is provided in the laws of the United States that "when ever, by reason of unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages of persons, or rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States, it shall become impracticable, in the judgment of the President, to enforce, by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings, the laws of the United States within any State or Territory, it shall be lawful for the President to call forth the militia of any or all the States, and to employ such parts of the land and naval forces of the United States as he may deem necessary to enforce the faithful execution of the laws of the United States, or to suppress such rebellion, in whatever State or Territory thereof the laws of the United States may be forcibly opposed or the execution thereof forcibly obstructed; "
And whereas it has been made to appear satisfactorily to me, by information received from the Governor of the Territory of Arizona, and from the General of the Army of the United States, and other reliable sources, that in consequence of unlawful combinations of evil disposed persons who are banded together to oppose and obstruct the execution of the laws, it has become impracticable to enforce, by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings, the laws of the United States within that Territory, and that the law& of the United States have been therein forcibly opposed and the execution thereof forcibly resisted ;
And whereas the laws of the United States require that whenever it may be necessary, in the judgment of the President, to use the military forces for the purpose of enforcing the faithful execution of the laws of the United States, he shall forthwith, by proclamation, command such insurgents to disperse and retire peaceably to their respective abodes, within a limited time:

Now, therefore, I, Chester A. Arthur, President of the United States,

do hereby admonish all good citizens of the United States, and especially of the Territory of Arizona, against aiding, countenancing, abetting, or taking part in any such unlawful proceedings, and I do

hereby warn all persons engaged in or connected with said obstruction of the laws, to disperse and retire peaceably to their respective abodes on or before noon of the fifteenth day of May.
In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.

A PROCLAMATION.

Preamble. Nov. 30,1882. Day of thanksgiving.
Day of National Thanksgiving and Prayer.
Deeds of charity, etc.
Signature.

In conformity with a custom the annual observance of which is justly

held in honor by this people, I, Chester A. Arthur, President of the United States, do hereby set apart Thursday, the 30th day of Novem ber next as a day of public Thanksgiving.
The blessings demanding our gratitude are numerous and varied. For the peace and amity which subsist between this Republic and all the nations of the world; for the freedom from internal discord and violence; for the increasing friendship between the different sections of

the land; for liberty, justice and constitutional government; for the devotion of the people to our free institutions and their cheerful obedience to mild laws; for the constantly increasing strength of the Republic while extending its privileges to fellow men who come to us; for the improved means of internal communication, and the increased facilities of intercourse with other Nations; for the general prevailing health of the year; for the prosperity of all our industries, the liberal

return for the mechanic's toil affording a market for the abundant harvests of the husbandman; for the preservation of the national faith and credit; for wise and generous provision to effect the intellectual

and moral education of our youth; for the influence upon the conscience of a restraining and transforming religion; and for the joys of home;

for these, and for many other blessings, we should give thanks. Wherefore, I do recommend that the day above designated be ob-
served throughout the country as a Day of National Thanksgiving and Prayer, and that the people, ceasing from their daily labors and meeting in accordance with their several forms of worship, draw near to the throne of Almighty God, offering to Him praise and gratitude for the manifold goodness which He has vouchsafed to us, and praying that

His blessings and His mercies may continue. And I do further recommend that the day thus appointed be made a
special occasion for deeds of kindness and charity to the suffering and

the needy, so that all who dwell within the land may rejoice and be. glad in this season of National Thanksgiving.
In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.

Outre les demandes dont il est question a Particle 9, concernant le remboursement des mandats, ]es deux Administrations conviennent de donner suite aux demandes relatives aux mandats echang6s entre la Belgique et les Etats-Unis, en ce qui touche, par exemple, les changements de noms, de lieux de payement, les demandes de renseignements au sujet de payements effectues, etc., et de traiter ces demandes conformement aux reglements en vigueur dans chaque pays
respectivement.
