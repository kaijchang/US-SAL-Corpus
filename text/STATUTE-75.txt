anniversary

March 1, 1961 iH' J» Re». 155]

Whereas Saturday, March 4, 1961, will mark the centenary of Abraham Lincoln's taking the oath of office as sixteenth President of the United States; and
Whereas the anniversary will be widely observed and noted throughout this land and overseas; and
Whereas the occasion will coincide with exercises commemorative of
the American Civil W a r of 1861-1865; and Whereas Mr. Lincoln stood at the head of the Government of the
United States and its Armed Forces during those years of tragedy and travail; and Whereas he foresaw the difficulty of the task before him as "greater than that which rested on Washington"; and Whereas he sought the guidance of Almighty God, saying, "Without
the assistance of that Divine Being . . . I cannot succeed. With that assistance I cannot fail."; and Whereas one who stood in the audience at his first inauguration would
later write, "the shouts which have resounded for him at the Capitol are still ringing in my ears."; and Whereas from a wooden platform, projected from the eastern portico, beneath an unfinished dome, he pleaded and reasoned that day for reconciliation and the preservation of the Union, saying:

[75 ST A T .

" I take the official oath today, with no mental reservations, and with no purpose to construe the Constitution or laws, by any hypercritical rules . . . . I hold, that in contemplation of universal law, and of the Constitution, the Union of these States is perpetual . . . . I t is safe to say that no government proper, ever had a provision in its organic law for its own termination . . . . Before entering upon so grave a matter as the destruction of our national fabric, with all its benefits, its memories, and its hopes, would it not be wise to ascertain precisely why we do it ? Will you hazard so desperate a step, while there is any possibility that any portion of the ills you fly from, have no real existence ? Will you, while the certain ills you fly to, are greater than all the real ones you fly from ? Will you risk the commission of so fearful a mistake? . . . Physically speaking, we cannot separate. We cannot remove our respective sections from each other, nor build an impassable wall between them. A husband and wire may be divorced, and go out of the presence, and beyond the reach of each other; but the different parts of our country cannot do this. They cannot but remain face to face; and intercourse, either amicable or hostile, must continue between them . . . . We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic cords of memory, stretching from every battlefield, and patriot grave, to every living heart and hearthstone, all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature."; and Whereas the better angels do, in fact, touch us: Now, therefore, be it

Price support for corn and grain sorghums shall be made available on not to exceed the normal production of the 1961 acreage of corn and grain sorghums of each eligible farm based on its average yield per acre for the 1959 and 1960 crop acreage.
"(2) The Secretary shall require as a condition of eligibility for price support on the 1961 crop of corn, grain sorghums, and any other feed grain which he may designate that the producer shall participate in the special agricultural conservation program for 1961 for corn and grain sorghums to the extent prescribed by the Secretary." SEC. 2. Section 16 of the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act, as amended, is amended by adding the following new subsection: " (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of law--
" (1) The Secretary shall formulate and carry out a special agricultural conservation program for 1961, without regard to provisions which would be applicable to the regular agricultural conservation program, under which, subject to such terms and conditions as the Secretary determines, conservation payments in amounts determined by the Secretary to be fair and reasonable shall be made to producers who divert acreage from the production of corn and grain sorghums to an approved conservation use and increase their average acreage devoted in 1959 and 1960 to designated soil conserving crops or practices by an equal amount: Provided^ however^ That any producer may elect in lieu of such payment to devote such diverted acreage to castor beans, safflower, sunflower, or sesame, if designated by the Secretary. Such special agricultural conservation program shall require the producer to take such measures as the Secretary may deem appropriate to keep such diverted acreage free from insects, weeds, and rodents. The acreage eligible for payments in cash or in an equivalent amount in kind under such conservation program shall be an acreage

PUBLIC LAW 87-5-MAR. 22, 1961

equivalent to 20 per centum of the average acreage on the farm planted to corn and grain sorghums in the crop years 1959 and 1960 or up to twenty acres, whichever is greater. Such payments in cash or in kind at the basic county support rate may be made on an amount of corn and grain sorghums not in excess of 50 per centum of the normal production of the acreage diverted from corn and grain sorghums on the farm based on its average yield per acre for the 1959 and 1960 crop acreage. Payments in kind only may be made by the Secretary for the diversion of up to an additional 20 per centum of such corn and grain sorghum acreage. Payments in kind on such additional acreage may be made at the basic county support rate on an amount of corn and grain sorghums not in excess of 60 per centum of the normal production of the acreage diverted from corn and grain sorghums on the farm based on its average yield per acre for the 1959 and 1960 crop acreage.

The Secretary may make not to exceed 50 per centum of any payments to producers in advance of determination of performance.
"(2) There are hereby authorized to be appropriated such amounts as may be necessary to enable the Secretary to carry out this section 16(c). Obligations may be incurred in advance of appropriations therefor and the Commodity Credit Corporation is authorized to advance from its capital funds such sums as may be necessary to pay administrative expenses in connection with such program during the fiscal year ending June 30,1961, and to pay such costs as may be included in carrying out section 3 of the Act which added this subsection to this Act.
"(3) The Secretary shall provide by regulations for the sharing of payments under this subsection among producers on the farm on a fair and equitable basis and in keepmg with existing contracts." SEC. 3. Payments in kind shall be made through the issuance of negotiable certificates which the Commodity Credit Corporation shall redeem for feed grains and, notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Commodity Credit Corporation shall, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, assist the producer in the marketing of such certificates at such time and in such manner as the Secretary determines will best effectuate the purposes of the 1961 Feed Grain Program authorized by this Act. In the case of any certificate not presented for redemption within 30 days of the date of its issuance, reasonable costs of storage and other carrying charges, as determined by the Secretary, for the period beginning 30 days after its issuance and ending with the date of its presentation for redemption shall be deducted from the value of the certificate.

DECLARATION OF PURPOSE
SEC. 2. The Congress declares that the maintenance of the national economy at a high level is vital to the best interests of the United States, but that some of our communities are suffering substantial and persistent unemployment and underemployment; that such unemployment and underemployment cause hardship to many individuals and their families and detract from the national welfare by wasting vital human resources; that to overcome this problem the Federal Government, in cooperation with the States, should help areas of substantial and persistent unemployment and underemployment to take effective steps in planning and financing their economic redevelopment; that Federal assistance to communities, industries, enterprises, and individuals in areas needing redevelopment should enable such areas to

48

PUBLIC LAW 87.27-MAY 1, 1961

achieve lasting improvement and enhance the domestic prosperity by the establishment of stable and diversified local economies and improved local living conditions; and that under the provisions of this Act new employment opportunities should be created by developing and expanding new and existing facilities and resources rather than by merely transferring jobs from one area of the United States to another.

REDEVELOPMENT AREAS
SEC. 5. (a) The Secretary shall designate as "redevelopment areas" those areas within the United States in which he determines, upon the basis of standards generally comparable with those set forth in paragraphs (1) and (2), that there has existed substantial and persistent unemployment for an extended period of time.

PUBLIC LAW 87-27-MAY 1, 1961

(1) where the Secretary of Labor finds that the rate of unemployment, excluding unemployment due primarily to temporary or seasonal factors, is currently 6 per centum or more and has averaged at least 6 per centum for the qualifying time periods specified in paragraph ( 2 ) ; and
(2) where the Secretary of Labor finds that the annual average rate of unemployment has been at least--
(A) 50 per centum above the national average for three of the preceding four calendar years, or
(B) 75 per centum above the national average for two of the preceding three calendar years, or
(C) 100 per centum above the national average for one of the preceding two calendar years.

(b) The Secretary sliall also designate as "redevelopment areas" those areas (including Indian reservations) within the United States which do not meet the requirements set forth in subsection (a) but which he determines are among the highest in numbers and percentages of low-income families, and in which there exists a condition of substantial and persistent unemployment or underemployment. In making the designations under this subsection and before extending any financial assistance as the result of designations under this subsection, the Secretary shall, by regulation,.prescribe detailed standards upon which the designations under this subsection shall be based. In tlie formulation of such standards the Secretary shall consider, among other relevant factors, the number of low-income farm families in the various rural areas of the United States, the proportion that such lowincome families are of the total farm families of each of such areas, the relationship of the income levels of the families in each such area to the general levels of income in the United States, the extent to which "rural development" projects have previously been located in any such area under programs administered by the Department of Agriculture, the current and prospective employment opportunities in each such area, the availability of manpower in each such area for supplemental employment, the extent of migration out of the area, and the proportion of the population of each such area which has been receiving public assistance from the Federal Government or from tlie State or States in which such area is located or from any municipality therein. In making the designations under this subsection, the Secretary shall endeavor to distribute the projects widely among the several States, so far as is feasible and proper, in order that actual experience with this program may be had in as many States and in as many areas and under as many different circumstances as possible.
In making these determinations the Secretary shall be guided, but not conclusively governed, by pertinent studies made, and information and data collected or compiled, by (1) departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the Federal Government, (2) State and local governments, (3) universities and land-grant colleges, and (4) private organizations.
(c) Upon the recpiest of the Secretary, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of the Interior, and such other heads of agencies as may be appropriate are authorized to conduct

The Secretary shall reimburse when appropriate, out of any funds appropriated to carry out the purposes of this Act, the foregoing officers for any expenditures incurred by them under this section.

TITLE VII--OPEN SPACE LAND
FINDINGS AND PURPOSE
SEC. 701. (a) The Congress finds that a combination of economic, social, governmental, and technological forces have caused a rapid expansion of the Nation's urban areas, which has created critical problems of service and finance for all levels of government and which, combined with a rapid population growth in such areas, threatens severe problems of urban and suburban living, including the loss of

184

PUBLIC LAW 87-70-JUNE 30, 1961

[76 ST A T .

valuable open-space land in such areas, for the preponderant majority of the Nation's present and future population.
(b) It is the purpose of this title to help curb urban sprawl and prevent the spread of urban blight and deterioration, to encourage more economic and desirable urban development, and to help provide necessary recreational, conservation, and scenic areas by assisting State and local governments in taking prompt action to preserve openspace land which is essential to the proper long-range development and welfare of the Nation's urban areas, in accordance with plans for the allocation of such land for open-space purposes.

FEDERAL GRANTS

Limitation. Appropriation. Restrictions.
Review of applications.

SEC. 702. (a) In order to encourage and assist in the timely acquisition of land to be used as permanent open-space land, as deiEined herein, the Housing and Home Finance Administrator (hereinafter referred to as the "Administrator") is authorized to enter into contracts to make grants to States and local public bodies acceptable to the Administrator as capable of carrying out the provisions of this title to help finance the acquisition of title to, or other permanent interests in, such land. The amount of any such grant shall not exceed 20 per centum of the total cost, as approved by the Administrator, of acquiring such interests: Provided^ That this limitation may be increased to not to exceed 30 per centum in the case of a grant extended to a public body which (1) exercises responsibilities consistent with the purposes of this title for an urban area as a whole, or (2) exercises or participates in the exercise of such responsibilities for all or a substantial portion of an urban area pursuant to an interstate or other intergovernmental compact or agreement. The faith of the United States is pledged to the payment of all grants contracted for imder this title.
(b) The Administrator may enter into contracts to make grants under this title aggregating not to exceed $50,000,000. There are hereby authorized to be appropriated, out of any moneys in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, the amounts necessary to provide for the payment of such grants as well as to carry out all other purposes of tnis title.
(c) No grants under this title shall be used to defray development costs or ordinarjr State or local governmental expenses, or to help finance the acquisition by a public body of land located outside the urban area for which it exercises (or participates in the exercise of) responsibilities consistent with the purpose of this title.
(d) The Administrator may set such further terms and conditions for assistance under this title as he determines to be desirable.
(e) The Administrator shall consult with the Secretary of the Interior on the general policies to be followed in reviewing applications for grants. To assist the Administrator in such review, the Secretary of the Interior shall furnish him appropriate information on the status of recreational planning for the areas to be served by the open-space land acquired with the grants. The Administrator shall provide current information to the Secretary from time to time on significant program developments.
PLANNING REQUIREMENTS

SEC. 703. (a) The Administrator shall enter into contracts to make grants for the acquisition of land under this title only if he finds that (1) the proposed use of the land for permanent open space is important to the execution of a comprehensive plan for the urban area meeting criteria he has established for such plans, and (2) a program of

75 S T A T . ]

P U B U C L A W 87-70-JUNE 30, 1961

186

comprehensive planning (as defined in section 701(d) of the Housing Act of 1954) is being actively carried on for the Urban area.
(b) In extending financial assistance under this title, the Administrator shall take such action as he deems appropriate to assure that local governing bodies are preserving a maximum of open-space land, with a minimum of cost, through the use of existing public land; the use of special tax, zoning, and subdivision provisions; and the continuation of appropriate private use of open-space land through acquisition and leaseback, the acquisition of restrictive easements, and other available means.
CONVERSIONS TO OTHER USES
SEC. 704. No open-space land for which a grant has been made under this title shall, without the approval of the Administrator, be converted to uses other than those originally approved by him. The Administrator shall approve no conversion of land from openspace use unless he finds that such conversion is essential to the orderly development and growth of the urban area involved and is in accord with the then apmicable comprehensive plan, meeting criteria established by him. The Administrator shall approve any such conversion only upon such conditions as he deems necessary to assure the substitution of other open-space land of at least equal fair market value and of as nearly as feasible equivalent usefulness and location.
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, STUDIES, AND PUBLICATION OP INFORMATION
SEC. 705. In order to carry out the purpose of this title the Administrator is authorized to provide technical assistance to State and local public bodies and to undertake such studies and publish such information, either directly or by contract, as he shall determine to be desirable. There are hereby authorized to be appropriated, out of any moneys in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, such amounts as may be necessary to provide for such assistance^ studies, and publication. Nothing contained in this section shall limit any authority of the Administrator under any other provision of law.

(1) By amending subsection (a) to read as follows: "SEC. 216. (a) The Secretary of Commerce is hereby authorized and directed, under such rules and regulations as he may prescribe, to establish and maintain the United States Maritime Service as a voluntary organization for the training of citizens of the United States to serve as licensed and unlicensed personnel on American merchant vessels. The Secretary is authorized to determine the number of persons to be enrolled for training and reserve purposes in the said Service, to fix the rates of pay and allowances oi such persons, and to prescribe such courses and periods of training as, in his discretion, are necessary to maintain a trained and efficient merchant marine personnel. The ranks, grades, and ratings for personnel of the said Service shall be the same as are now or shall hereafter be prescribed for the personnel of the Coast Guard. The Secretary is authorized to prescribe, by rules and regulations, the uniform of the Service and rules governing the wearing and furnishing of such uniform of persons in the Service."
(2) By adding at the end of the section, two new subsections to read as follows:
"(e) To effectuate the purpose of this section, the Secretary of Commerce is authorized to employ professors, lecturers, and instructors and to compensate them without regard to the Classification Act of 1949, as amended.
" ( f ) On such date as may be fixed by the Civil Service Commission with the approval of the Secretary oi Commerce, not later than one year from the date of enactment of this subsection, persons then serving as administrative enrollees shall be brought into the competitive civil service or excepted civil service in accordance with the Civil Service Act and rules, and shall thereafter be compensated in accordance with the Classification Act of 1949, as amended, except as otherwise authorized by subsection (e) of this section or other provisions of law, and shall be subject to other laws of general applicability to civilian employees of the United States, subject to the following exceptions and conditions, notwithstanding any other provisions of law:
"(1) The rate of basic compensation of any person serving as administrative enrollee on the date immediately preceding the date specified in the first sentence of this subsection (f) shall upon conversion provided for in this subsection be fixed at a rate which is not less than the combined basic pay and quarters and subsistence allowances received immediately preceding conversion, or the value of such allowances when furnished the person in kind at the rate and in the amounts theretofore authorized by regulation for such allowances. I n the case of any such person whose combined basic pay and q[uarters and subsistence allowances, or value thereof when furnished in kind, exceeds the entrance rate of the grade or level in which his position is placed, the basic compensation of such person shall be fixed at that step in the grade or level which is equal to, or if none be equal, which represents the next higher regular or longevity step or level over the person's combined pay and allowances, as specified above, received im-

75 S T A T . ]

PUBLIC LAW 87-94-JULY 20, 1961

mediately preceding the date of conversion. In any case in which no such rate exists in the grade of his position, his rate of basic compensation shall be fixed at the next regular salary rate which is not less than his combined basic pay and quarters and subsistence allowances, or value thereof when furnished m kind. For the purposes of determining eligibility for step increases following conversion, the basic compensation as an administrative enroUee prior to conversion shall be considered as the total amount or value of basic pay, subsistence and quarters allowances. Any adjustment in compensation required by this subsection shall not be considered to be an equivalent increase in compensation for the purpose of a periodic step increase, nor an increase in grade or rate of basic compensation for the purpose of a longevity step increase.
"(2) The rate of basic compensation authorized by this paragraph shall continue until the person is separated from his position or receives a higher rate of basic compensation by operation of law or regulation.
"(3) Any person who, as a result of the action required under the first sentence of this subsection (f), becomes subject to the Annual and Sick Leave Act of 1951, as amended (5 U.S.C. 2061 and the following), shall be credited under that Act with all annual leave remaining to his credit as an administrative enrollee, at the rate of five-sevenths of a day of leave chargeable under the Act (5 U.S.C. 2064) for each calendar day of leave remaining to the credit of the enrollee, without regard to the limitations on maximum leave accumulation provided by the Act, and shall be credited with thirteen days of sick leave in addition to any leave recredit to which the employee may otherwise be entitled.
" (4) Active service of any administrative enrollee performed prior to the date specified in the first sentence of this subsection (f) shall be considered creditable as civilian employment in the executive branch of the Federal Government for all purposes, except that in computing length of service for the purpose of title VII of the Classification Act of 1949, as amended, continuous service immediately preceding the date established under the first sentence of this subsection (f) shall be counted either (1) toward one step increase under section 701, or (2) toward one longevity step increase under section 703, as the case may be.
" (5) Persons converted from their status as administrative enroUees to positions b^ or pursuant to this subsection (f) shall not be entitled, upon conversion or subsequent separation from such position, to payment of travel and transportation expenses which otherwise may be authorized under the joint travel regulations on separation from the United States Maritime Service; nor shall such persons upon conversion to positions by or pursuant to this subsection be entitled to free medical, dental, surgical and hospital care under section 322(6) of the Public Health Service Act of 1944 (58 Stat. 696, 42 U.S.C. 249)."

I'roviding for the apportionment to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts of its share of funds authorized for the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1963.
Whereas the Commonwealth of Massachusetts by Act of its Legislature, approved May 25, 1961, (Chapter 523, Massachusetts Acts of 1961) has amended its laws relative to the gross weight load of certain motor vehicles operated on the highways of the Commonwealth including routes on the Interstate System; and

substantially above that legally permitted by State law on July 1, 1956, was enacted and approved without full knowledge of the conflict of such amendment with the provisions of section 127 of title 23, United States Code; and
Whereas section 127 of title 23, United States Code, provides that no funds authorized to be appropriated for the Interstate System for any fiscal year shall be apportioned to any State within the boundaries of which the Interstate System may lawfully be used by vehicles in excess of certain specified weights and dimensions, unless such vehicles could be so lawfully operated within such State on Julv 1, 1956, and that any funds withheld under these provisions shall lapse; and
Whereas the amendment to the Massachusetts laws approved May 25, 1961, has the effect of exceeding the maximum weight limitations of section 127 of title 23, United States Code; and
Whereas the withholding from apportionment and consequent lapsing of funds for the Interstate System for the fiscal year 1963 would cause undue hardship to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and inasmuch as its legislature, having adjourned, does not have reasonable opportunity to enact corrective legislation in sufficient time to prevent such lapse of funds since the apportionment for the fiscal year 1963 is expected to be made by the Secretary of Commerce in the near future: Therefore be it

Resolved hy the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled^ That notwithstanding section 127 of title 23 of the United States Code, the Secretary of Commerce shall apportion to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts its share of funds authorized to be appropriated for the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1963. Such apportionment shall be made in accordance with section 104(b)(5) of title 23 of the United States Code and shall be subject to the condition that the funds so apportioned shall not be obligated or otherwise expended by such Commonwealth so long as the vehicle weight and width limitations established by the law of such Commonwealth exceed such limitations contained in section 127 of title 23 of the United States Code. If on March 15, 1962, the vehicle weight and width limitations established by the law of such Commonwealth exceed such limitations contained in section 127 of title 23 of the United States Code, then funds apportioned to such Commonwealth under this joint resolution shall lapse.

The Secretary shall determine the percentage factor by which the average acreage of durum wheat (class II) produced during the last two-year period for which statistics are available (excluding any increases in durum wheat acreage as a result of increases in wheat acreage allotments authorized by this subsection) must be increased to satisfy such demand. The wheat acreage allotment for any farm established for such crop without regard to this subsection, after reduction in the case of the 1962 crop as required by scctiou 334(c) (2), (hereinafter referred to as the 'original allotment')
shall be increased by an acreage computed by multiplying the average acreage of durum wheat (class I I ) on the farm during such two-year period (excluding any increase in the acreage of durum wheat as a result of an increase in the wheat acreage allotment for the farm authorized by this subsection) by such percentage factor: Provided^ That such increased allotment shall not exceed the cropland on the farm well suited to wheat. The increase in the wheat acreage allotment for any farm shall be conditioned upon the production of an acreage of durum wheat (class I I ) at least equal to the average acre-

Any increases in wheat acreage allotments authorized by this subsection shall be in addition to the National, State, and county wheat acreage allotments, and such increases shall not be considered in establishing future State^ county, and farm allotments. The provisions of paragraph (6) of Public Law 74, Seventy-seventh Congress (7 U.S.C. 1340(6)), and section 326(b) of this Act, relating to the reduction of the storage amount of wheat shall apply to the allotment for the farm established without regard to this subsection and not to the increased allotment under this subsection.

SEC. 132. Section 16 of the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act, as amended, is amended by adding the following new subsection : " (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of law--
"(^1) The Secretary shall formulate and carry out a special agricultural conservation program for 1962, without regard to provisions which would be applicable to the regular agricultural conservation program, under which, subject to such terms and conditions as the Secretary determines, conservation payments in amounts determined by the Secretary to be fair and reasonable shall be made to producers who divert acreage from the production of corn and grain sorghums, and barley, respectively, to an approved conservation use and increase their average acreage of cropland devoted in 1959 and 1960 to designated soil conserving crops or practices including summer fallow and idle land by an equal amount: Provided, however, That any producer may elect in lieu of such payment to devote such diverted acreage to castor beans, guar, safflower, sunflower, or sesame, if designated by the Secretary. In order to be eligible for a payment, a producer (other than a producer of malting barley as described in sectiou 105(c) (4) of the Agricultural Act of 1949) who par-
ticipates in the special agricultural conservation program of 1962 for corn and grain sorghums must not knowingly devote an acreage on the farm in excess of the average acreage devoted on the farm to barley in 1959 and 1960, and a producer who participates in the special agricultural conservation program for 1962 for barley must not knowingly devote an acreage on the farm to corn and grain sorghums in excess of the average acreage devoted on the farm to corn and grain sorghums m 1959 and 1960. Such special agricultural conservation program shall require the producer to take such measures as the Secretary may deem appropriate to keep such diverted acreage free from insects, weeds, and rodents. The acreage eligible for payments in cash or in an equivalent amount in kind under such conservation program shall be an acreage equivalent to 20 per centum of the average acreage on the farm planted to corn and grain sorghums, or barley, in the crop years 1959 and 1960 or up to twenty acres, whichever is greater. Such payments in cash or in kind at the basic county support rate for the 1961 crop in effect at the time payment rates for the special feed grain program for 1962 are established, adjusted to reflect any changes between the national support rates for the 1961 and 1962 crops may be made on an amount of the commodity not in excess of 50 per centum of the normal production of the acreage diverted from the commodity on the farm based on its adjusted average yield per acre for the 1959 and 1960 crop acreage. Payments in kind only may be made by the Secretary for the diversion of up to an additional 20 per centum of the average acreage on the farm planted to corn and grain sorghums, or barley, in the crop years 1959 and 1960. Payments in kind on such additional acreage may be made at the basic county support rate for the 1961 crop in effect at the time payments rates for the special feed gram program for 1962 are established, adjusted to reflect

any changes between the national support rates for the 1961 and

1962 crops on an amount of corn and grain sorghums, or barley,

not in excess of 60 per centum of the normal production of the

acreage diverted from the commodity on the farm based on its

adjusted average yield per acre for the 1959 and 1960 crop acre-

age. The Secretary may make such adjustments in acreage

and yields for the 1959 and 1960 crop years as he determines

necessary to correct for abnormal factors affecting production,

and to give due consideration to tillable acreage, crop rotation

practices, type of soil, soil and water conservation measures,

and topography. To the extent that a producer proves the

actual acreages and yields for the farm for the 1959 and 1960

crop years, such acreages and yields shall be used in making

determinations. The Secretary may make not to exceed 50 p e r

centum of any payments to producers in advance of determina-

tion of performance.

"(2) There are hereby authorized to be appropriated such Appropriation,

amounts as may be necessary to enable the Secretary to carry

out this section 16(d). Obligations may be incurred m advance

of appropriations therefor and the Commodity Credit Corpora-

tion is authorized to advance from its capital fimds such sums as

may be necessary to pay administrative expenses in connection

with such program during the fiscal year ending J u n e 30, 1962,

and to pay such costs as may be incurred in carrying out section

133 of the Agricultural Act of 1961.

" (3) The Secretary shall provide by regulations for the sharing

of payments under this subsection among producers on the farm

on a fair and equitable basis and in keeping with existing

contracts."

SEC. 133. Payments in cash shall be made by Commodity Credit Payments.

(yorporation and payments in kind shall be made through the issuance

of negotiable certificates which the Commodity Credit Corporation

shall redeem for feed grains and, notwithstanding any other provi-

sion of law, the Commodity Credit Corporation shall, in accordance

with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, assist the producer in

the marketing of such certificates at such time and in such manner as

the Secretary determines will best effectuate the purposes of the special

feed grain program for 1962 authorized by this Act. I n the case of

any certificate not presented for redemption within thirty days of the

date of its issuance, reasonable costs of storage and other carrying

charges, as determined by the Secretary, for the period beginning

thirty days after its issuance and ending with the date of its presenta-

tion for redemption shall be deducted from the value of the certificate.

A petition for rehearing must be filed within thirty days from the date upon which public notice is given of the order, decision, report, or action complained of. No such application shall excuse any person from complying with or obeying any order, decision, report, or action of the Commission, or operate in any manner to stay or postpone the enforcement thereof, without the special order of the Commission. The filing of a petition for rehearing shall not be a condition precedent to judicial review of any such order, decision, report, or action, except where the party seeking such review (1) was not a party to the proceedings resulting in such order, decision, report, or action, or (2) relies on questions of fact or law upon which the Commission, or designated authority within the Commission, has been afforded no opportunity to pass. The Commission, or designated authority within the Commission, shall enter an order, with a concise statement of the reasons therefor, denying a petition for rehearing or granting such petition, in whole or in part, and ordering such further proceedings as may be appropriate: Provided, That in any case where such petition relates to an instrument of authorization granted without a hearing, the Commission, or desig-

PART I

CHAPTER 1--SHORT TITLE AND POLICY

Act for International D e v e l o p ment of 1961.

SEC. 101. SHORT TITLE.--This part may be cited as the "Act for International Development of 1961".
SEC. 102. STATEMENT OF POLICY.--It is the sense of the Congress that peace depends on wider recognition of the dignity and interdependence of men, and survival of m e institutions in the United States can best be assured in a worldwide atmosphere of freedom.
To this end, the United States has in the past provided assistance to help strengthen the forces of freedom by aiding peoples of less developed friendly countries of the world to develop their resources and improve thfir living standards, to realize their aspirations for justice, education, dignity, and respect as individual human beings, and to establish responsible governments.
The Congress declares it to be a primary necessity, opportunity, and responsibility of the United States, and consistent with its traditions and ideals, to renew the spirit which lay behind these past efforts, and to help make a historic demonstration that economic growth and political democracy can go hand in hand to the end that an enlarged community of free, stable, and self-reliant countries can reduce world tensions and insecurity.
It is the policy of the United States to strengthen friendly foreign countries by encouraging the development of their free economic institutions and productive capabilities, and by minimizing or eliminating barriers to the flow of private investment capital.

75 S T A T . ]

PUBLIC LAW 8 7 - 1 9 5 - S E P T . 4, 1961

425

In addition, the Congress declares that it is the policy of the United States to support the principles of increased economic cooperation and trade among countries, freedom of the press, information, and religion, freedom of navigation in international waterways, and recognition of the right of all private persons to travel and pursue their lawful activities without discrimination as to race or religion. In the administration of all parts of this Act these principles shall be supported in such a way m our relations with countries friendly to the United States which are in controversy with each other as to promote an adjudication of the issues involved by means of international law procedures available to the parties.
Accordingly, the Congress hereby affirms it to be the policy of the United States to make assistance available, upon request, under this part in scope and on a basis of long-range continuity essential to the creation of an environment in which the energies of the peoples of the world can be devoted to constructive purposes, free of pressure and erosion by the adversaries of freedom. I t is the sense of the Congress that assistance under this part should be complemented by the furnishing under any other Act of surplus agricultural commodities and by disposal of excess property under this and other Acts.
Also, the Congress reaffirms its conviction that the peace of the world and the security of the United States are endangered so long as international communism continues to attempt to bring under Communist domination peoples now free and independent and to keep under domination peoples once free but now subject to such domination. I t is, therefore, the policy, of the United States to continue to make available to other free countries and peoples, upon request, assistance of such nature and in such amounts as the United States deems advisable and as may be effectively used by free countries and peoples to help them maintain their freedom. Assistance shall be based upon sound plans and programs; be directed toward the social as well as economic aspects of economic development; be responsive to the efforts of the recipient countries to mobilize their own resources and help themselves; be cognizant of the external and internal pressures which hamper their growth; and should emphasize long-range development assistance as the primary instrument of such growth.
The Congress reaffirms its belief in the importance of regional organizations of free peoples for mutual assistance, such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the European Economic Community, the Organization of American States, the Colombo Plan, the South East Asia Treaty Organization, the Central Treaty Organization, and others, and expresses its hope that such organizations may be strengthened and broadened, and their programs of self-help and mutual cooperation may be made more effective in the protection of the independence and security of free people, and in the development of their economic and social well-being, and the safeguarding of their basic rip-hts and liberties.
Finally, the Congress urges that all other countries able to contribute join in a common undertaking to meet the goals stated in this part.

tional Peace and Security Act of 1961". SEC. 502. STATEMENT OF POLICY.--The Congress of the United
States reaffirms the policy of the United States to achieve international peace and security through the United Nations so that armed force shall not be used except for individual or collective self-defense. The Congress hereby finds that the efforts of the United States and other friendly countries to promote peace and security continue to require measures of support based upon the principle of effective self-help and mutual aid. I t is the purpose of this part to authorize measures in the common defense against internal and external aggression, including

^MHitary assist- ^he fumishiug of military assistance, upon request, to friendly coun-

tries and international organizations. In furnishing such military

75 S T A T . ]

PUBLIC LAW 8 7 - 1 9 5 - S E P T . 4, 1961

435

assistance, it remains the policy of the United States to continue to exert maximum efforts to achieve universal control of weapons of mass destruction and universal regulation and reduction of armaments, including armed forces, under adequate safeguards to protect complying countries against violation and evasion.

The Congress recognizes that the peace of the world and the security

of the United States are endangered so long as international com-

munism and the countries it controls continue by threat of military

action, by the use of economic pressure, and by internal subversion,

or other means to attempt to bring under their domination peoples

now free and independent and continue to deny the rights of freedom

and self-government to peoples and countries once free but now subject

to such domination.

It

is the

sense

of

the

Congress

that

an

important

contribution

toward

I n t ern a t i o n military force.

al

peace would be made by the establishment under the Organization of

American States of an international military force.

I n enacting this legislation, it is therefore the intention of the Con- in^n^f^^ s s i o n ai gress to promote the peace of the world and the foreign policy, security, and general welfare of the United States by fostering an improved climate of political independence and individual liberty, improving the ability of friendly countries and international organizations to deter or, if necessary, defeat Communist or Communist-supported aggression, facilitating arrangements for individual and collective security, assisting friendly countries to maintain internal security, and creating an environment of security and stability in the developing friendly countries essential to their more rapid social, economic, and political progress. The Congress urges that all other countries able to contribute join in a common undertaking to meet the goals stated in this part.

Finally, the Congress reaffirms its full support of the progress of the members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization toward increased cooperation in political, military, and economic affairs. In particular, the Congress welcomes the steps which have been taken to promote multilateral programs of coordinated procurement, research, development, and production of defense articles and urges that such programs be expanded to the fullest extent possible to further the defense of the North Atlantic Area.

CHAPTER 2--MILITARY ASSISTANCE
SEC. 503. GENERAL AUTHORITY.--The President is authorized to furnish military assistance on such terms and conditions as he may determine, to any friendly country or international organization, the assisting of which the President finds will strengthen the security of the United States and promote world peace and which is otherwise eligible to receive such assistance, by--

"(6) if the validity of a deportation order has not been judicially determined, its validity may be cliallenged in a criminal proceeding against the alien for violation of subsection (d) or (e) of section 242 of this Act only by separate motion for judicial

Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to preclude the Attorney General from detaining or continuing to detain an alien or from taking him into custody pursuant to subsection (c) of section 242 of this Act at any time after the issuance of a deportation order;
"(8) it shall not be necessary to print the record or any part thereof, or the briefs, and the court shall review the proceedings on a typewritten record and on typewritten briefs; and

" (c) A n order of deportation or of exclusion shall not be reviewed by any court if the alien has not exhausted the administrative remedies available to him as of right under the immigration laws and regulations or if he has departed from the United States after the issuance of the order. Every petition for review or for habeas corpus shall state whether the validity of the order has been upheld in any prior judicial proceeding, and, if so, the nature and date thereof, and the court in which such proceeding took place.

JOINT RESOLUTION To create a regional agency by intergovernmental compact for the planning,

Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assemhled^

PART I

COMPACT

Delaware R i v e r Basin Compact.

Whereas the signatory parties recognize the water and related ^ resources of the Delaware River Basin as regional assets vested with local, State, and National interests, for which they have a joint responsibility; and
Whereas the conservation, utilization, development, management, and control of the water and related resources of the Delaware River Basin under a comprehensive multipurpose plan will bring the greatest benefits and produce the most efficient service in the public welfare; and
Whereas such a comprehensive plan administered by a basinwide agency will provide effective flood damage reduction; conservation and development of ground and surface water supply for municipal, industrial, and agricultural uses; development of recreational facilities in relation to reservoirs, lakes, and streams; propagation of fish and game; promotion of related forestry, soil conservation, and watershed projects; protection and aid to fisheries dependent upon water resources; development of hydroelectric power potentialities; improved navigation; control of the movement of salt water; abatement and control of stream pollution; and regulation of stream flows toward the attainment of these goals; and
Whereas decisions of the United States Supreme Court relating to the waters of the basin have confirmed the interstate regional character of the water resources of the Delaware River Basin, and the United States Corps of Engineers has in a prior report on the Delaware River Basin (House Document 179, Seventy-third Congress, second session) officially recognized the need for an interstate agency and the economies that can result from unified development and control of the water resources of the basin; and
Whereas the water resources of the basin are presently subject to the duplicating, overlapping, and uncoordinated administration of some forty-three State agencies, fourteen interstate agencies, and nineteen Federal agencies which exercise a multiplicity of powers and duties resulting in a splintering of authority and responsibilities; and
Whereas tlie joint advisory body known as the Interstate Commission on the Delaware River Basin ( I N C O D E L ) , created by the respective commissions or Committee on Interstate Cooperation of the States of Delaware, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania, has on the basis on its extensive investigations, surveys, and studies concluded that regional development of the Delaware River Basin is feasible, advisable, and urgently needed; and has recommended that an interstate compact with Federal participation be consummated to this end; and

75 S T A T . ] PUBLIC LAW 87-328-SEPT. 27, 1961

689

Whereas the Congress of the United States and the executive branch of the Government have recognized the national interest in the Delaware River Basin by authorizing and directing the Corps of Engineers, Department of the Army, to make a comprehensive survey and report on the water and related resources of the Delaware River Basin, enlisting the technical aid and planning participation of many Federal, State^ and municipal agencies dealing with the waters of the basin, and in particular the Federal Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Health, Education, and Welfare, and Interior, and the Federal Power Commission; and
Whereas some twenty-two million people of the United States at present live and work in the region of the Delaware River Basin and its environs, and the government, employment, industry, and economic development of the entire region and the health, safety, and general welfare of its population are and will continue to be vitally affected by the use, conservation, management, and control of the water and related resources of the Delaware River Basin; and
Whereas demands upon the waters and related resources of the basin are expected to mount rapidly because of the anticipated increase in the population of the region projected to reach thirty million by 1980 and forty million by 2010, and because of the anticipated increase in industrial growth projected to double by 1980; and
AVhereas water resources planning and development is technical, complex, and expensive, and has often required fifteen to twenty years from the conception to the completion of a large dam and reservoir; and
Whereas the public interest requires that facilities must be ready and operative when needed, to avoid the catastrophe of unexpected floods or prolonged drought, and for other purposes; and
Whereas the Delaware River Basin Advisory Committee, a temporary body constituted by the Governors of the four basin States and the mayors of the cities of New York and Philadelphia, has prepared a draft of an interstate-Federal compact for the creation of a basin agency, and the signatory parties desire to effectuate the purposes thereof: Now therefore
Be it enacted hy the Senate and Home of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled^ That the United States hereby consents to, and joins the States of Delaware, New Jersey, and New York and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in, the following compact:

"(c) Before suspending a license pursuant to subsection (a), or issuing a cease and desist order pursuant to subsection (b), the Administration shall serve upon the licensee involved an order to show cause why an order suspending the license or a cease and desist order should not be issued. Any such order to show cause shall contain a statement of the matters of fact and law asserted by the Administration and the legal authority and jurisdiction under which a hearing is to be held, and shall inform the licensee that a hearing will be held before the Administration at a time and place stated in the order. If after hearing, or a waiver thereof, the Administration determines on the record that an order suspending the license or a cease and desist order should issue, it shall promptly issue such order, which shall include a statement of the findings of the Administration and the grounds and reasons therefor and specify the effective date of the order, and shall cause the order to be served on the licensee.

If before such record is filed the Administration amends or sets aside its order, in w^hole or in part, the petitioner may amend the petition within such time as the court may determine, on notice to the Administration. The filing of a petition for review shall not of itself stay or suspend the operation of the order of the Administration, but the court of appeals in its discretion may restrain or suspend, in whole or in part, the operation of the order pending the final hearing and determination of the petition.

Be it enacted hy the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled^ That the Shipping Act, 1916, is amended by adding after section 14a a new section to read as follows:
"SEC. 14b. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Act, on application the Federal Maritime Commission (hereinafter 'Commission'), shall, after notice, and hearing, by order, permit the use by any common carrier or conference of such carriers in foreign commerce of any contract, amendment, or modification thereof, which is available to all shippers and consignees on equal terms and conditions, which provides lower rates to a shipper or consignee w^ho agrees to give all or any fixed portion of his patronage to such carrier or conference of carriers unless the Commission finds that the contract, amendment, or modification thereof will be detrimental to the commerce of the United States or contrary to the public interest, or unjustly discriminatory or unfair as between shippers, exporters, importers, or ports, or between exporters from the United States and their foreign competitors, and provided the contract, amendment, or modification thereof, expressly (1) permits prompt release of the contract shipper from the contract with respect to any shipment or shipments for which the contracting carrier or conference of carriers cannot provide as much space as the contract shipper shall require on reasonaole notice; (2) provides that whenever a tariff rate for the carriage of goods under the contract becomes effective, insofar as it is under the control of the carrier or conference of carriers, it shall not be increased before a reasonable period, but in no case less than ninety d a j s ; (3) covers only those goods of the contract shipper as to the shipment of which he has the legal right at the time of shipment to select the carrier: Provided^ however^'T\\?ii it shall be deemed a breach of the contract if, before the time of shipment and with the intent to avoid his obligation under the contract, the contract shipper divests himself, or with the same intent permits himself to be divested, of the legal right to select the carrier and the shipment is carried by a carrier which is not a party to the contract; (4) does not require the contract shipper to divert shipment of goods from natural routings not served by the carrier or conference of carriers where direct carriage is available; (5) limits damages recoverable for breach by either party to actual damages to be determined after breach in accordance with the principles of contract law: Provided^ however^ That the contract may specify that in the case of a breach by a contract shipper the damages may be an amount not exceeding the freight charges computed at the contract rate on the particular shipment, less the cost of handling; (6) permits the contract shipper to terminate at any time without penalty upon ninety days' notice; (7) provides for a spread between ordinary rptes and rates charged contract shippers which the Commission finds to be reasonable in all the circumstances but which spread shall in no event be more than 15 per centum of the ordinary rates; (8) excludes cargo of the contract shippers which is loaded and carried in bulk without mark or count except liquid bulk cargoes, other than chemicals, in less than full shipload lots: Provided^ however., That upon finding that economic factors so warrant, the Commission may exclude from the contract any commodity subject to the

foregoing exception; and (9) contains such other provisions not in-

consistent herewith as the Commission shall rec[uire or permit. The

Commission shall withdraw permission which it has granted under

the authority contained in this section for the use of any contract if

it finds, after notice and hearing, that the use of such contract is de-

trimental to the commerce of the United States or contrary to the

public interest, or is unjustly discriminatory or unfair as between

shippers, exporters, importers, or ports, or between exporters from

the United States and their foreign competitors. The carrier or con-

ference of carriers may on ninety days' notice terminate without

penalty the contract rate system herein authorized, in whole or with

respect to any commodity: Provided^ hoicever^ That after such ter-

mination the carrier or conference of carriers may not reinstitute such

contract rate system or part thereof so terminated without prior per-

mission by the Commission in accordance with the provisions of this

section. Any contract, amendment, or modification of any contract

not permitted by the Commission shall be unlawful, and contracts,

amendments, and modifications shall be lawful only when and as long

as permitted by the Commission: before permission is granted or after

permission is withdrawn it shall be unlawful to carry out in whole or

in part, directly or indirectly, any such contract, amendment, or modi-

fication. As used in this section, the term 'contract shipper' means

a person other than a carrier or conference of carriers who is a party

to a contract the use of which may be permitted under this section."

SEC. 2. Section 15, Shipping Act, 1916, is amended to read as fol-

lows:

"SEC. 15. That every common carrier by water, or other person sub-

ject to this Act, shall file immediately with the Commission a true

copy, or, if oral, a true and complete memorandum, of every agreement

with another such carrier or other person subject to this Act, or modifi-

cation or cancellation thereof, to which it may be a party or conform

in whole or in part, fixing or regulating transportation rates or fares;

giving or receiving special rates, accommodations, or other special priv-

ileges or advantages; controlling, regulating, preventing, or destroying

competition; pooling or apportioning earnings, losses, or traffic; allot-

character of sailings between ports; limiting or regulating in any way

the volume or character of freight or passenger traffic to be carried; or

in any manner providing for an exclusive, preferential, or cooperative

States and their foreign competitors, or to operate to the detriment of

the commerce of the United States, or to be contrary to the public

interest, or to be in violation of this Act, and shall approve all other

agreements, modifications, or cancellations. No such agreement shall

be approved, nor shall continued approval be permitted for any agree-

ment (1) between carriers not members of the same conference or

conferences of carriers serving different trades that would otherwise

be naturally competitive, unless in the case of agreements between car-

riers, each carrier, or in the case of agreements between conferences,

TITLE I--POSITIONS IN TOP GRADES OF CLASSIFICA-

T I O N A C T O F 1949

CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND DECLARATION Or POLICY WITH RESPECT TO TOP GRADES OF CLASSIFICATION ACT OF 1949

SEC. 101. (a) The Congress hereby finds that-- (1) the public interest requires that effective limitations and
controls be established and maintained with respect to the allocation of positions--whether by law or by administrative action--
to grades 16, 17, and 18 of the Classification Act of 1949--the so-called top grades below the Federal executive level in the Government service--in order to prevent the unwarranted allocation of positions to such grades and to promote efficiency and economy in the operation of the Government;
(2) one of the principal purposes of the Classification Act of 1949, as originally enacted and as amended from time to time, was, and continues to be, the establishment and maintenance, by specific provisions of such Act, of a coordinated and comprehensive authority and control over the allocation of positions to these top grades of such Act;
(3) under the rules of the Senate and the rules of the House of Representatives, as applicable, and the IjCgislative Reorganization
Act of 1946, the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service of the Senate and the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service of the House of Representatives are vested with exclusive legislative jurisdiction, and charged with the duty of exercising legislative oversight and supervision, with respect to all matters within the purview of the Classification Act of 1949 and the administration thereof, including the allocation of positions to these top grades of such Act ;
(4) this legislative authority, dutv, and jurisdiction of such committees, and the orderly and established legislative processes of the Congress generally in this respect, are being undermined by the increasing practice, resulting from certain solicitations from individual departments and agencies in the executive branch and elsewhere, of allocating additional numbers of positions to such top grades by means of appropriation Acts and other laws and reorganization plans (other than the Classification Act of 1949) which disregard the numerical limitations or the standards and procedures, or both, with respect to the allocation of positions to such grades;
(5) at the present time, therefore, the pertinent provisions of the Classification Act of 1949 do not reflect, even by approximation, the existing state of the law with respect to the total number of positions which may be allocated to the top grades of such Act; and
(6) this state of affairs subverts and undermines the object and purpose of the Classification Act of 1949 with respect to the allocation of positions to such top grades of such Act.

(b) I t is, therefore, hereby declared to be the sense of the Congress--
(1) that the matter of requesting the allocation of additional numbers of positions to the top grades of the Classification Act of
1949, whether by groups of positions or on an individual basis, is properly within the jurisdiction of those standing committees of the Senate and House of Representatives having jurisdiction over the Classification Act of 1949 in accordance with orderly and established legislative processes--the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service of the Senate and the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service of the House of Representatives;
(2) that the Director of the Bureau of the Budget, the United States Civil Service Commission, and other authority designated by the President exercise to the fullest extent the authority and responsibility of disapproving requests of the departments and agencies in the executive branch for individual exceptions (to be attained through the enactment of laws outside the jurisdiction of the committees above referred to) from the numerical limitations or the standards and procedures, or both, imposed by the Classification Act of 1949 with respect to the allocation of positions to the top grades of such Act; and
(3) that, if need should develop for increasing such numerical limitations or waiving such standards or procedures, or both, in any case or cases, the matter should be presented promptly to the Congress in a manner consistent with the legislative authority, duty, responsibility, and jurisdiction of the respective Committees on Post Office and Civil Service of the Senate and House of Representatives.

October 5, 1961 [S. 1728]

Be it enacted hy the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled^ That section 510 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 (46 U.S.C. 1160), is amended by:
(1) Striking the present subsection (b) and inserting in lieu thereof the following:
" ( b ) I n order to promote the construction of new, safe, and efficient vessels to carry the domestic and foreign waterborne commerce of the United States, the Commission is authorized, subject to the provisions of this section, to acquire any obsolete vessel in exchange for an allowance of credit. The obsolete vessel shall be acquired by the Commission, if the owner so requests, either at the time the owner contracts for the construction or purchase of a new vessel or within five days of the actual date of delivery of the new vessel to the owner. The amount of the allowance shall be determined at the time of the acquisition of the obsolete vessel by the Commission. In the event the obsolete vessel is acquired by the Commission at the time the owner contracts for the construction or purchase of the new vessel, the allowance shall not be paid to the owner of the obsolete vessel, but shall be applied upon the purchase price of a new vessel. I n the .case of a new vessel constructed under the provisions of this Act, such allowance may, under such terms and conditions as the Commission may prescribe, be applied upon the cash payments required under this Act. In case the new vessel is not constructed under the provisions of this Act, the allowance shall, upon acquisition of the obsolete vessel by the Commission, be paid, for the account of the owner, to the shipbuilder constructing such new vessel. In the event that title to the obsolete vessel is acquired by the Commission at the time of delivery of the new vessel, the allowance shall be deposited in the owner's capital reserve fund. This subsection shall apply to obsolete vessels exchanged for new vessels hereafter contracted to be built, or eligible for such exchange but not exchanged in connection with a contract for new vessels executed prior to October 1,1960."
(2) Striking the present subsection (d) and inserting in lieu thereof the following:
" ( d ) The allowance for an obsolete vessel shall be the fair and re9.sonable value of such vessel as determined by the Commission. In making such determination the Commission shall consider: (1) the scrap value of the obsolete vessel both in American and foreign markets, (2) the depreciated value based on a twenty or twenty-five year life, whichever is applicable to the obsolete vessel, and (3) the market value thereof for operation in the world trade or in the foreign or domestic trade of the United States. I n the event the obsolete vessel is acquired by the Commission at the time the owner contracts for the construction of the new vessel, and the owner uses such vessel during the period of construction of the new vessel, the allowance shall be reduced by an amount representing the fair value of such use. The / a t e for the use of the obsolete vessel shall be fixed by the Commission for the entire period of such use at the time of execution of the contract for the construction of the new vessel."

Whereas the Government of the United States enjoys close and friendly relations with the Government of the Republic of China, including treaty obligations which this Government honors; and
Whereas the Republic of China has faithfully discharged its obligations under the Charter of the United Nations; and
Whereas the Chinese Communist government has flagrantly violated basic human rights, has imposed on the Chinese people one of the most brutal regimes known to history, and is without authority to speak for the Chinese people other than the authority that derives from usurpation and tyranny; and
Whereas the Chinese Communist regime by its aggression in Korea, its repression in Tibet, its threats against its neighbors, its failure to release American prisoners as promised, its export of narcotics to non-Communist countries, in collaboration with criminal elements in these countries, on a scale that makes it the major source of the international illicit narcotics traffic, and its hostility toward the United States and the United Nations has demonstrated that it is not qualified for representation in the United Nations: Therefore be it

Whereas at a moment in our history when we need all our sense of purpose and capability to match the challenge of disciplined communism some say that our national symbol of "Uncle Sam" is archaic and should be disowned; and
Whereas the symbol of "Uncle Sam" was evoked out of the needs of a young Nation, and is linked to a grassroots character, Samuel Wilson, of Troy, New York, who still represents the strength and idealism that made up the greatest Nation in the world; and
Whereas the years 1766 to 1854, the years in which Samuel Wilson lived, witnessed the birth and glorious progress of the United States, spanning as they did the period before the Declaration of Independence to the emergence of the United States as a world power; and

Whereas the encouragement of private and public participation in international economic development is vital to the achievement of a free and democratic economic growth process, and the responsibility for stimulating international economic growth, and especially the growth of those nations in the less-developed areas, must be shared and supported, in accordance >vith their capacity, by the peoples of the world, whether as individuals or through their private organizations and their governments; and
Whereas the Government of the United States and its people have consistently endorsed the aspirations of all peoples and nations to realize a free and prosperous society and have, toward these ends, actively supported and participated in programs for free economic development; and
Whereas the success or failure of these objectives and the freedom of the individual, his nation, and the world, depend upon the scope and quality of public understanding and the ability of the individual to focus on this historic movement of our century, and is dependent upon the ability of the leaders in the great endeavor to understand each other and each other's efforts and thus find ways by which mutual efforts can be joined for the good of all mankind; and

"Whereas further purposes of this assembly and exposition are to provide the opportunity to bring to the United States, which has spearheaded the effort for the betterment of mankind, representatives of national governments and international and national government and private agencies including foundations and educational, religious, labor, banking, and business organizations and institutions and the general public to enable them, and their American counterparts, to come together to report, explain, and evaluate their progress, roles, and operations, catalog needs as yet unmet, exchange views and plan within a coherent framework the new opportunities for private and government cooperation, chart new and mutually productive and advantageous paths into a future, and achieve a closer understanding and collaboration in this great and essential endeavor; and
Whereas it is the declared policy of the United States to encourage the contribution of United States enterprise toward economic strength of less-developed countries, through private trade and investment abroad and exchange of ideas and technical information, and to increase mutual understanding between the people of the United States and the people of other countries, usm^ to the maximum extent practicable the facilities of private agencies, and the World Economic Progress Assembly and Exposition will provide a unique and effective means of carrying out these objectives; and

WHEREAS, on August 30, 1960, I requested the United States Tariff Commission to make an investigation under the Said section 22 with respect to this matter; and
WHEREAS the Tariff Commission has made such investigation and has reported to me its findings and recommendations made in connection therewith; and
WHEREAS, on the basis of the investigation and report of the Tariff Commission, I find that, in the absence of import restrictions beyond October 31, 1960, tung oil and tung nuts are practically certain to be imported into the United States under such conditions and in such quantities as to materially interfere with the said price-support program; and
WHEREAS I find and declare Uiat the imposition of the limitations on imports of tung oil and tung nuts hereinafter proclaimed is shown by such investigation of the Tariff Commission to be necessary in &rder that th entry of tung oil and tung nuts will not materially interfere with such price-support program; and
WHEREAS I find that the limitations on lm{)orts of tung oil and tung nuts hereinafter proclaimed will not reduce the permissible total quantity of tung oil and tung nuts which may be entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption, to proportionately less than 50 per centum of the average annual quantity of tung oil and tung nuts entered during the representative period November 1, 1952, to October 31, 1956, inclusive:
NOW. THEREFORE, I, DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER, President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended, do hereby proclaim as follows:
1. For each of the three twelve-month periods beginning on November 1, 1960, November 1, 1961, and November 1, 1962, the total aggregate quantity of tung oil

2. Of the 26,000,000 pounds specified in paragraph 1 not more than 22,100,000 pounds shall be the product of Argentina, nor more than 2,964,000 pounds shall be the product of Paraguay, nor more than 936,000 pounds shall be the product of other foreign countries; and of the 6,500,000 pounds specified in paragraph 1 not more than 5,525,000 pounds shall be the product of Argentina, nor more than 741,000 pounds shall be the product of Paraguay, nor more than 234,000 pounds shall be the product of other foreign countries.
For the purposes of this proclamation the oil equivalent of tung nuts shall be computed on the basis of 15.9 pounds of oil for each 100 pounds of whole nuts, and on the basis of 35.8 pounds of oil for each 100 pounds of decorticated nuts.
In order to assure equitable treatment to supplying countries, all tung oil and tung nuts entered or withdrawn pursuant to this proclamation shall have been a direct shipment destined to the United States on an original through bill of lading from the country of production.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be afiaxed.

WHEREAS it has long been our custom as a people to pause from our labors for one day at the close of the harvest season and give special thanks to Almighty God for the bounty which He has bestowed upon our land; and
WHEREAS again this year we have been blessed with an abundant harvest; and
WHEREAS it is fitting and appropriate at this time of national thanksgiving that we should remember and respond to the needs of those of other lands; and
WHEREAS the Congress of the United States, by a joint resolution approved December 26, 1941 (55 Stat. 862; 5 U.S.C. 87b), has designated the fourth Thursday of November in each year as Thanksgiving Day:
NOW, THEREFORE, I, DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER, President of the United States of America, in consonance with the aforesaid resolution of Congress, do hereby proclaim Thursday, November 24, 1960, as a day of national thanksgiving; and I urge the people of the United States to give grateful thought to the observance of this day.
Furthermore, I call upon our people, while giving thanks for our blessings, to direct their thoughts to the peoples of other lands less fortunate than we. In particular, I urge my fellow Americans to support and assist the efforts which we as a Nation, working individually and in cooperation with other nations, are directing toward the solution of the world-food problem.
Under our Food-for-Peace Program, a distinguished company of voluntary citizens' groups and religious societies is making heart-warming contributions to this effort. I ask our people to give them continued support.

At the same time, I urge my fellow Americans to assist in the Preedomfrom-Hunger Campaign of the United Nations Pood and Agriculture Organization. Our Government fully supports the objectives of this organization. But success of its campaign requires the active cooperation of generous citizens, and of public and private groups, in our country and around the world.
Let us hope that some day, under a benevolent Providence and through the best use of the world's Grod-given resources, each nation will have reason to celebrate its own thanksgiving day.

CIVIL WAR CENTENNIAL
By the President of the United States
of America
A Proclamation
The years 1961 to 1965 will mark the one-hundredth anniversary of the American Civil War.
That war was America's most tragic experience. But like most truly great tragedies, it carries with it an enduring lesson and a profound inspiration. It was a demonstration of heroism and sacrifice by men and women of both sides who valued principle above life itself and whose devotion to duty is a part of our Nation's noblest tradition.
Both sections of our now magnificently reunited country sent into their armies men who became soldiers as good as any who ever fought under any flag. Military history records nothing finer than the courage and spirit displayed at such battles as Chickamauga» Antietam, Kenesaw Mountain, and Gettysburg. That America could produce men so valiant and so enduring is a matter for deep and abiding pride.
The same spirit on the part of the people at home supported and strengthened those soldiers through four years of great trial. That a Nation which contained hardly more than thirty million people. North and South together, could sustain six hundred thousand deaths without faltering is a lasting testimonial to something unconquerable in the American spirit. And that a transcending sense of unity and larger common purpose could, in the end, cause the men and women who had suffered so greatly to close ranks once the contest ended and to go on together to build a greater, freer, and happier America must be a source of inspiration as long as our country may last.
By a joint resolution approved on September 7, 1957 (71 Stat. 626), the Congress established the Civil War Centennial Commission to prepare plans and

[75 STAT.

75 STAT.]

PROCLAMATION 3382--DEC. 6, 1960

999

programs for the nationwide observances of the one-hundredth anniversary of the Civil War, and requested the President to issue proclamations inviting the people of the United States to participate in those observances.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER, President of the United States of America, do hereby invite all of the people of our country to take a direct and active part in the Centennial of the Civil War.
I request all units and agencies of government--Federal, State, and local-- and their officials to encourage, foster, and participate in Centennial observances. And I especially urge our Nation's schools and colleges, its libraries and museums, its churches and religious bodies, its civic, service, and patriotic organizations, its learned and professional societies, its arts, sciences, and industries, and its informational media, to plan and carry out their own appropriate Centennial observances during the years 1961 to 1965; all to the end of enriching our knowledge and appreciation of this momentous chapter in our Nation's history and of making this memorable period truly a Centennial for all Americans.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be afifixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this sixth day of December in the year of our
Lord nineteen hundred and [SEAL] sixty, and of the Independence
of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-fifth.

WHEREAS I find that in order to permit the entrance of new importers and equitable adjustments of allocations in a manner which will insure that adequate supplies of residual fuel oil to be used as fuel will be distributed to normal users, it is necessary to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to revise the system of allocating imports into the East Coast areas of residual fuel oil to be used as fuel:
NOW, THEREFORE, I, DWIGHT D.

tunities for the cultivation of learning and wisdom; and
WHEREAS it is appropriate that a special period be set aside each year to mark the importance of education and the continuing need to improve and strengthen it:

I urge that all of us during that week take part, through school and community, in observances to focus attention upon the force for good which education has been and must continue to be in our national life; and that we honor our teachers and school officials for whom every week is education week.
The education of our people should be a lifelong process by which we continue to feed new vigor into the lifestream of the Nation through intelligent, reasoned decisions. Let us not think of education only in terms of its costs, but rather in terms of the infinite potential of the human mind that can be realized through education. Let us think of education as the means of developing our greatest abilities, because in each of us there is a private hope and dream which, fulfilled, can be translated into benefit for everyone and greater strength for our Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.

EXPLANATION
General.
The following tables are designed to serve as a guide to prior laws and other Federal instruments which are patently amended, repealed, referred to, or otherwise cited by the textual provisions of the public laws contained in this volume. These tables were initiated as a separate pamphlet to accompany Volume 70 of the United States Statutes at Large. Beginning with Volume 71, they are being published as an integral part of each volume.
From time to time the tables will be cumulated and made separately available as a convenience to users. Tables 1-9 of Volumes 70-74 covering the years 1956 through 1960 have been cumulated and published as a separate pamphlet. Coverage and arrangement of the tables are subject to change with a view to improved usefulness.
The arrangement of the tables is outlined above. There are two basic groups: (1) Tables 1-10 cover amendments, repeals, and other actions directly affecting prior laws and other Federal instruments; and (2) Tables 11-19 cover all citations and other references to prior laws and other Federal instruments.
Details of Arrangement.
Tables 1-9 are limited to cases in which prior laws and other Federal instruments are expressly affected.
Table 10 is a catch-all table designed as a finding aid to relationships which are expressed in general terms. Listed in this table are all pubKc laws in this volume
nil

1112

LAWS AFFECTED IN VOLUME 75

which contain such provisions as "notwithstanding any other provision of law," and "all laws in conflict with this law are hereby repealed."
Tables 11-19 cover all other cases in which prior laws or other Federal instruments are mentioned in the text of the public laws in this volume, without regard to the purpose underlying such reference.
In each of the basic groups the first and largest table is entitled "General Legislation," and contains listings of all laws affected which have not been codified in the Revised Statutes, the Internal Revenue Codes, or in those titles of the United States Code which have been enacted into positive law. Succeeding tables cover these codified provisions, as well as other instruments such as reorganization plans, veterans' regulations. Executive orders and proclamations, and treaties and international agreements. The numbering of the tables in the two groups is parallel. Thus Table 2 and Table 12 both relate to the Revised Statutes; Table 7 and Table 17 both relate to veterans' regulations.
Table 1 is arranged chronologically. In preparing this table the "basic act" principle has been followed. Under this principle the key listing of amendatory legislation will be found under the basic act affected, rather than under intervening amendments thereto. Furthermore, all laws included are treated as if tables covering prior volumes of the United States Statutes at Large were in existence. Thus, no attempt is made to give an historical picture of a law, and only the latest amendment in the chain will be reflected. Occasionally, to promote clarity, cross references have been supplied at key points.
Users of Table 1 should, therefore, look under the date, public law number, or statutes volume and page lUumber of the basic act affected, in order to determine whether changes have been made by the public laws contained in this volume. Although a given section of any act may have been added at a later date, the section is carried under the date and statutes citation of the basic act. For this reason the page numbers in the column headed "Statutes volume and page" are the numbers of the page on which each act begins.
All tables are arranged chronologically, except where the existence of a system of codification makes possible a sequential arrangement from the lowest to the highest title or section number. In Tables 1-10 there is a "Comment" column, in which the nature of the affecting action is described. These are editorial comments, intended to reflect what is patent in the laws reviewed, and every effort has been made to avoid interpretations.
In Tables 11-19 the "Comment" column is unnecessary, since in each instance the comment would be "Cited" or "Referred to." In these tables, moreover, the number of columns has been held to a minimum in the interest of brevity. Thus Table 11 contains only three columns listing the date and number of the law referred to, and the page number in this volume at which the reference may be found.
Caveat.
All the tables are editorially compiled and presented as reference guides only. Hence they have no evidentiary status or legal effect. Indirect or implied relationships are not included. These may be found through use of the Subject Index or through research based on the text itself.
The Office of the Federal Register invites criticisms or suggestions with a view to improving the tables wherever possible.
