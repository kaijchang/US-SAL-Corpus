Cha p. LV.--An Act to modify the act of the fourteenth of July, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-two, and all other acts imposing duties on imports, (a)
Re it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America, in Congress assembled, That from and after the thirty-
first day of December, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-three, in all cases where duties are imposed on foreign imports, by the act of the fourteenth day of July, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-two, entitled "An act to alter and amend the several acts imposing duties on imports," or by any other act, shall exceed twenty per centum on the value thereof, one tenth part of such excess shall be deducted; from and after the thirty-first day of December, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-five, another tenth part thereof shall be deducted; from and after the thirty-first day of December, one thousand eight hundred and thirtyseven, another tenth part thereof shall be deducted; from and after the thirty-first day of December, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-nine, another tenth part thereof shall be deducted; and from and after the thirty-first day of December, one thousand eight hundred and forty-one, one half of the reside [residue] of such excess shall be deducted; and from and after the thirtieth day of June, one thousand eight hundred and forty-two, the other half thereof shall be deducted.
Sec . 2. And be itfurther enacted, That so much of the second sec-
tion of the act of the fourteenth of July aforesaid, as fixes the rate of duty on all milled and fulled cloth, known by the names of plains, kerseys, or kendal cottons, of which wool is the only material, the value whereof does not exceed thirty-five cents a square yard, at five per centum ad valorem, shall be, and the same is hereby, repealed. And the said

Statute II. March 2, 1833. Act of July 14, 1832, ch. 227. Act ofMarch 2, 1833, ch. 57. Act of Aug. 30, 1822, ch. 270. After Dec. 31, 1833, all duties exceeding twenty per cent. to be reduced by biennially striking off one-tenth of the excess, &c.
Duty on plains, kerseys, &c. raised to fifty per cent.

(a) The act of Congress of March 2, 1833, ch. 55, commonly called " The compromise act," did not, prospectively, repeal all duties upon imports after 30th June, 1842. Repealing only such parts of previous acts as were inconsistent with itself, it left in force, after June 1842, the same duties which were in force on the first of June, 1842. Aldridge and others v. Williams, 3 Howard, 1.
The provisions of the act of 1833, by which duties were to be levied, after June 1, 1842, on the home valuation, " under such regulations as may be prescribed by law," comprehended all the regulations existing under the law at the time when the duties, according to the home valuation, accrued. The regulations established by the 7th and 8th sections of the act of 1832, were, after the compromise act expired, in force, and were sufficient for the collection of duties after June 1, 1842. Ibid.
The 9th section of the act of 1832, makes it the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury, under the direction of the President, to establish, when necessary, rules and regulations to secure a just, faithful, and impartial appraisal of merchandise, and just and proper entries of them. It is very clear that any regulations within the authority thus given, are regulations prescribed by law. Ibid.
In expounding this law, the judgment of the court cannot, in any degree, be influenced by the construction placed upon it by individual members of Congress, in the debate which took place on its passage ; nor by the motives or reasons assigned by them for supporting or opposing amendments offered. The law, as it passed, is the will of a majority of both houses, and the only mode in which this will is spoken, is in the act itself; and we must gather their intention from the language there used, comparing it, where any ambiguity exists, with laws upon the same subject; and looking, if necessary, to the public history of the times in which it was passed.

Cha p. LV.--An Act to modify the act of the fourteenth of July, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-two, and all other acts imposing duties on imports, (a)
Re it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America, in Congress assembled, That from and after the thirty-
first day of December, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-three, in all cases where duties are imposed on foreign imports, by the act of the fourteenth day of July, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-two, entitled "An act to alter and amend the several acts imposing duties on imports," or by any other act, shall exceed twenty per centum on the value thereof, one tenth part of such excess shall be deducted; from and after the thirty-first day of December, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-five, another tenth part thereof shall be deducted; from and after the thirty-first day of December, one thousand eight hundred and thirtyseven, another tenth part thereof shall be deducted; from and after the thirty-first day of December, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-nine, another tenth part thereof shall be deducted; and from and after the thirty-first day of December, one thousand eight hundred and forty-one, one half of the reside [residue] of such excess shall be deducted; and from and after the thirtieth day of June, one thousand eight hundred and forty-two, the other half thereof shall be deducted.
Sec . 2. And be itfurther enacted, That so much of the second sec-

And the said

Duty on plains, kerseys, &c. raised to fifty per cent.

(a) The act of Congress of March 2, 1833, ch. 55, commonly called " The compromise act," did not, prospectively, repeal all duties upon imports after 30th June, 1842. Repealing only such parts of previous acts as were inconsistent with itself, it left in force, after June 1842, the same duties which were in force on the first of June, 1842. Aldridge and others v. Williams, 3 Howard, 1.
The provisions of the act of 1833, by which duties were to be levied, after June 1, 1842, on the home valuation, " under such regulations as may be prescribed by law," comprehended all the regulations existing under the law at the time when the duties, according to the home valuation, accrued. The regulations established by the 7th and 8th sections of the act of 1832, were, after the compromise act expired, in force, and were sufficient for the collection of duties after June 1, 1842. Ibid.
The 9th section of the act of 1832, makes it the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury, under the direction of the President, to establish, when necessary, rules and regulations to secure a just, faithful, and impartial appraisal of merchandise, and just and proper entries of them. It is very clear that any regulations within the authority thus given, are regulations prescribed by law. Ibid.
In expounding this law, the judgment of the court cannot, in any degree, be influenced by the construction placed upon it by individual members of Congress, in the debate which took place on its passage ; nor by the motives or reasons assigned by them for supporting or opposing amendments offered. The law, as it passed, is the will of a majority of both houses, and the only mode in which this will is spoken, is in the act itself; and we must gather their intention from the language there used, comparing it, where any ambiguity exists, with laws upon the same subject; and looking, if necessary, to the public history of the times in which it was passed.

Feb. 14, 1833. Proclamation, April 12, 1834.

Made and concluded at Fort Gibson, on the Arkansas river on the fourteenth day of February one thousand eight hundred and
thirty-three, by and between Montfort Stokes, Henry L. Ellsworth and John F. Schermerhorn duly appointed Commissioners
on the. part of the United States and the undersigned Chiefs and Head-men of the Cherokee nation of Indians west of the Mississippi, they being duly authorized and empoivered by their nation.

Preamble. Ante, p. 311.

Wher eas articles of convention were concluded at the city of Washington, on the sixth day of May one thousand eight hundred and twentyeight, between James Barbour Secretary of War, being specially authorized therefor by the President of the United States, and the chiefs and head men of the Cheerokee nation of Indians west of the Mississippi, which articles of convention were duly ratified. And whereas it was agreed by the second article of said convention as follows " That the United States agree to possess the Cheerokees, and to guarantee it to them forever, and that guarantee is solemnly pledged, of seven millions of acres of land, said land to be bounded as follows; viz, commencing at a point on Arkansas river, where the eastern Choctaw boundary line strikes said river, and running thence with the western line of Arkansas Territory to the southwest corner of Missouri, and thence with the western boundary line of Missouri till it crosses the waters of Neasho, generally called Grand river, thence due west, to a point from which a
due south course will strike the present northwest corner of Arkansas Territory, thence continuing due south on and with the present boundary line on the west of said Territory, to the main branch of Arkansas river, thence down said river to its junction with the Canadian, and thence up, and between said rivers Arkansas and Canadian to a point at which a line, running north and south, from river to river, will give the aforesaid seven millions of acres, thus provided for and bounded.
The United States further guarantee to the Cherokee nation a perpetual outlet west, and a free and unmolested use of all the country lying west of the western boundary of the above-described limits; and as far west-, as the sovereignty of the United States and their right of soil extend. And whereas there was to said articles of convention and agreement, the following proviso viz. " Provided nevertheless, that said convention, shall not be so construed, as to extend the northern boundary of said perpetual outlet west, provided for and guarantied in the second article of said convention, north of the thirty-sixth degree of north latitude, or so as to interfere with the lands assigned, or to be assigned, west of the Mississippi river, to the Creek Indians who have emigrated, or may emigrate, from the States of Georgia and Alabama, under the provision of any treaty, or treaties, heretofore concluded, between the United States, and the Creek tribe of Indians--and provided further, that nothing in said convention, shall be construed, to cede, or assign, to the Cheerokees any lands heretofore ceded, or assigned, to any tribe, or tribes of Indians, by any treaty now existing and in force, with any such tribe or tribes."--And whereas, it appears from the Creek treaty, made with the United States, b}r the Creek nation, dated twenty-fourth day of January eighteen hundred and twenty-six, at the city of Washington;
(414)

that they had the right to select, and did select, a part of the country described within the boundaries mentioned above in said Cherokee articles of agreement--and whereas, both the Cheerokee and Creek nations of Indians west of the Mississippi, anxious to have their boundaries settled in an amicable manner, have met each other in council, and, after full deliberation mutually agreed upon the boundary lines between them--Now therefore, the United States on one part, and the chiefs and head-men of the Cherokee nation of Indians west of the
Mississippi on the other part, agree as follows:
Arti cle I. The United States agree to possess the Cheerokees, and to guarrantee it to them forever, and that guarrantee, is hereby pledged, of seven millions of acress of land, to be bounded as follows viz: Beginning at a point on the old western territorial line of Arkansas Territory, being twenty-five miles north from the point, where the Territorial Jine crosses Arkansas river--thence running from said north point, south, on the said Territorial line, to the place where said Territorial line crosses the Verdigris river--thence down said Verdigris river, to the Arkansas river--thence down said Arkansas to a point, where a stone is placed opposite to the east or lower bank of Grand river at its junction with the Arkansas--thence running south, forty-four degrees west, one mile--thence in a straight line to a point four miles northerly from the mouth of the north fork of the Canadian--thence along the said four miles line to the Canadian--thence down the Canadian to the Arkansas--thence, down the Arkansas, to that point on the Arkansas, where the eastern Choctaw boundary strikes, said river; and running thence with the western line of Arkansas Territory as now defined, to the southwest corner of Missouri--thence along the western Missouri line, to the land assigned the Senecas; thence, on the south line of the Senecas to Grand river; thence, up said Grand river, as far as the south line of the Osage reservation, extended if necessary-- thence up and between said south Osage line, extended west if necessary and a line drawn due west, from the point of beginning, to a certain distance west, at which, a line running north and south, from said Osage line, to said due west line, will make seven millions of acres within the whole described boundaries. In addition to the seven millions of acres of land, thus provided for, and bounded, the United States, further guarrantee to the Cheerokee nation, a perpetual outlet west and a free and unmolested use of all the country lying west, of the western boundary of said seven millions of acres, as far west as the sovereignty of the United States and their right of soil extend--Provided however, that if the saline, or salt plain, on the great western prairie, shall fall within said limits prescribed for said outlet, the right is reserved to the United States to permit other tribes of red men, to get salt on said plain in common with the Cheerokees--and letters patent shall be issued by the United States as soon as practicable for the land hereby guaranteed.

Land granted to Cherokeec.
Further guaranty.

Arti cle II. The Cherokee nation hereby relinquish and quit claim to the United States all the right interest and title which the Cheerokees have, or claim to have in and to all the land ceded, or claimed to have been ceded to said Cheerokee nation by said treaty of sixth of May one thousand eight hundred and twenty-eight, and not embraced within the limits or boundaries fixed in this present supplementary treaty or articles of convention and agreement.
Art icl e HI. The Cherokee nation, having particularly requested the United States to annul and cancel the sixth article of said treaty of sixth May, one thousand eight hundred and twenty-eight, the United States, agree to cancel the same, and the same is hereby annulled-- Said sixth article referred to, is in the following words--" It is moreover

agreed by the United States, when the Cheerokees may desire it, to give them a plain set of laws, suited to their condition--also when they may wish to lay off their lands and own them individually, a surveyor shall be sent to survey them at the expense of the United States.
Arti cle IV. In consideration of the establishment of new boundaries in part, for the lands ceded to said Cheerokee nation, and in view of the improvement of said nation, the United States will cause to be erected, on land now guarranteed to the said nation, four blacksmith shops, one wagon maker shop, one wheelwright shop, and necessary tools and implements furnished for the same; together with one ton of iron, and two hundred and fifty pounds of steel, for each of said blacksmith shops, to be worked up, for the benefit of the poorer class of red men, belonging to the Cherokee nation--And the United States, will employ four blacksmiths, one wagon-maker, and one wheelwright, to work in said shops respectively, for the benefit of said Cheerokee nation; and said materials shall be furnished annually, and said services continued, so long as the President may deem proper--And said United States, will cause to be erected on said lands, for the benefit of said Cheerokees, eight patent railway corn mills, in lieu of the mills to be erected according to the stipulation of the fourth article of said treaty, of sixth of May, one thousand eight hundred twenty-eight, from the avails of the sale of the old agency.
Article V. These articles of agreement and convention are to be considered supplementary, to the treaty before mentioned between the United States, and the Cheerokee nation west of the Mississippi dated sixth of May one thousand eight hundred and twenty-eight, and not to vary the rights of the parties to said treaty, any further, than said treaty is inconsistent with the provisions of this treaty, now concluded, or these articles of convention and agreement.
Arti cle VI. It is further agreed by the Cheerokee nation, that one mile square shall be reserved and set apart from the lands hereby guaranteed, for the accommodation of the Cheerokee agency; and the location of the same shall be designated by the Cheerokee nation, in conjunction with the agent of the Government of the United States.
Arti cle VII. This treaty, or articles of convention, after the same have been ratified, by the President and Senate shall be obligatory on the United States and said Cheerokee nation.

In testimony whereof, the said Montfort Stokes, Henry L. Ellsworth and John F. Schermerhorn, commissioners as aforesaid, and the
chiefs and head-men of the Cheerokee nation aforesaid have hereunto set their hands, at Fort Gibson on the Arkansas river, on the 14th day of February one thousand eight hundred and thirty-three.

TREATY WITH THE SEMINOLE INDIANS.
Whe rea s , the Seminole Indians of Florida, entered into certain articles of agreement, with James Gadson, [Gadsden,] Commissioner on behalf of the United States, at Payne's landing, on the 9th day of May, 1832: the first article of which treaty or agreement provides, as follows : " The Seminoles Indians relinquish to the United States all claim to the land they at present occupy in the Territory of Florida, and agree to emigrate to the country assigned to the Creeks, west of the Mississippi river; it being understood that an additional extent of territory proportioned to their number will be added to the Creek country, and that the Seminoles will be received as a constituent part of the Creek nation, and be re-admitted to all the privileges as members of the same." And whereas, the said agreement also stipulates and provides, that a delegation of Seminoles should be sent at the expense of the United States to examine the country to be allotted them among the Creeks, and should this delegation be satisfied with the character of the country and of the favorable disposition of the Creeks to unite with them as one people, then the aforementioned treaty would be considered binding and obligatory upon the parties. And whereas a treaty was made between the United States and the Creek Indians west of the Mississippi, at Fort Gibson, on the 14th day of February 1833, by which a country was provided for the Seminoles in pursuance of the existing arrangements between the United States and that tribe. And whereas, the special delegation, appointed by the Seminoles on the 9th day of May 1832, have since examined the land designated for them by the undersigned Commissioners, on behalf of the United States, and have expressed themselves satisfied with the same, in and by their letter dated, March 1833, addressed to the undersigned Commissioners.
Now, therefore, the Commissioners aforesaid, by virtue of the power and authority vested in them by the treaty made with Creek Indians on the 14th of February 1833, as above stated, hereby designate and assign to the Seminole tribe of Indians, for their separate future residence, forever, a tract of country lying between the Canadian river and the north fork thereof, and extending west to where a line running north and south between the main Canadian and north branch, will strike the forks of Little river, provided said west line does not extend more than twenty-five miles west from the mouth of said Little river. And the undersigned Seminole chiefs, delegated as aforesaid, on behalf of their

the friendship and ability of their present agent, Major Phagen, and desire that he may be permitted to remove them to their new homes w'est of the Mississippi; the Commissioners have considered their re-
quest, and cheerfully recommend Major Phagan as a suitable person to be employed to remove the Seminoles as aforesaid, and trust his appointment will be made, not only to gratify the wishes of the Indians but as

rate them and receive them as a constituent part of their tribe as contemplated by their treaty with the United States, and as they saw no alternative but to perish if they continued there, or to return to their old residence on the Arkansas, they therefore chose the latter; and whereas they now find themselves very unhappily situated in consequence of having their little improvements taken from them by the settlers of the country; and being anxious to secure a permanent and peaceable home the following articles or treaty are agreed upon between the United States and the Quapaw Indians by John F. Schermerhorn-----------------commissioners of Indian affairs west and the chiefs and warriors of said Quapaw Indians this (13th) thirteenth day of May 1833.--

Art icl e I. The Quapaw Indians hereby relinquish and convey to the United States all their right and title to the lands given them by the Caddo Indians on the Bayou Treache of Red River.--

Art . II. The United States hereby agree to convey to the Quapaw Indians one hundred and fifty sections of land west of the State line of Missouri and between the lands of the Senecas and Shawnees, not heretofore assigned to any other tribe of Indians, the same to be selected
and assigned by the commissioners of Indian affairs west, and which is
expressly designed to be [in] lieu of their location on Red River and
to carry into effect the treaty of 1824, in order to provide a permanent
home for their nation; the United States agree to convey the same by patent, to them and their descendants as long as they shall exist as a
nation or continue to reside thereon, and they also agree to protect them in their new residence, against all interruption or disturbance from any other tribe or nation of Indians or from any other person or persons whatever.

Art . III. Whereas it is the policy of the United States in all their intercourse with the Indians to treat them liberally as well as justly, and to endeavour to promote their civilization and prosperity; it is further agreed that in consideration of the important and extensive cessions of lands made by the Quapaws to the United States and in view of their present impoverished and wretched condition, they shall be removed to their new homes at the expense of the United States and that they will supply them with one year's provision from the time of their removal, which shall be as soon as they receive notice of the ratification of this treaty by the President and Senate of the United States. The United
States will also furnish and deliver to them, after their arrival at their new homes, one hundred cows, one hundred breeding hogs, one hundred sheep, ten yoke of working cattle, twenty-five ploughs, one hundred axes, one hundred hoes, four ox carts, and one wagon, with all their necessary rigging, twenty iron hand corn-mills, tools of different descriptions to the amount of two hundred dollars, also looms, wheels, reels and wool-cards to the amount of two hundred dollars, one hundred

The United States also agree to appropriate one thousand dollars per year for education purposes to be expended under the direction of the President of the United States; the farmer and blacksmith and the above appropriation for education purposes to be continued only as long as the President of the United States deems necessary for the best interests of the Indians.

present annuities perpetual and limited, the United States will pay the debts of the Quapaw Indians according to the annexed schedule to the amount of four thousand one hundred and eighty dollars provided they can be discharged in full for that amount. They will also expend to the amount of one thousand dollars in hiring suitable labourers to build and aid them in erecting comfortable cabins and houses to live in; and also that they will pay them annually two thousand dollars for twenty years from the ratification of this treaty, and that out of said annuity there shall be allowed to their four principal-chiefs, Hackatton, Sarassan, Tonnonjinka and Kaheketteda, and to their successors each, in addition to their distributive share of said annuity, the sum of fifty dollars per year.

Art . VI. The United States also agrees to employ an interpreter to accompany them on their removal and the same to continue with them during the pleasure of the President of the United States -- The above treaty shall be binding on the United States whenever ratified and approved by the President and Senate of the United States.--

Made and concluded at Fort Gibson, between Montfort Stokes, Henry L. Ellsworth and John F. Schermerhorn, Commissioners on the part of the United States, and the undersigned Chiefs and Head-men of the Muskogee or Creek nation of Indians, this \4th day of February, A. D. 1833.

Feb. 14, 1833. Proclamation, April 12, 1834.

Whereas , certain articles of a treaty were concluded at the City of

Washington, on the 24th day of January one thousand eight hundred

and twenty-six, by and between James Barbour, Secretary of War, on

behalf of the United States, and the Chiefs and head-men of the Creek

nation of Indians; by which it is agreed that the said Indians shall

remove to a country west of the Mississippi river: and whereas the

sixth article of said treaty provides as follows :--" that a deputation of

five persons shall be sent by them, (the Creek nation) at the expense

of the United States, immediately after the ratification of the treaty, to

examine the country west of the Mississippi, not within the limits of the

States or Territories, and not possessed by the Choctaws or Cherokees.

And the United States agree to purchase for them, if the same can con-

veniently be done upon reasonable terms, wherever they may select, a

country, whose extent shall in the opinion of the President, be propor-

tioned to their numbers. And if such purchase cannot be thus made,

it is then agreed that the selection shall be made where the Presiden

may think proper, just reference being had to the wishes of the emi-

grating party." And whereas, the Creek Indians aforesaid, did send

five persons as delegates, to explore the country pointed out to them by

their treaty; which delegates selected a country west of the Territory

of Arkansas, lying and being along and between the Verdigris, Arkan-

sas, and Canadian rivers: and, to the country thus selected, a party of

the Creek Indians emigrated the following year. And whereas certain

articles of treaty or convention, were concluded at the city of Wash-

ington on the 6th day of May, A. D. one thousand eight hundred and

twenty-eight, by and between James Barbour Secretary of War, on

behalf of the United States, and certain chiefs and head-men of the Cherokee nation of Indians; by the second article of which convention,

a country was assigned to the Cherokee Indians aforesaid, including within its boundaries some of the lands previously selected and claimed

by the Creek Indians, under their treaty aforesaid. And whereas, the

President and Senate of the United States, for the purpose of protecting

the rights secured to the Creek Indians, by their treaty stipulations,

and with a view to prevent collision and misunderstanding between the

two nations, ratified and confirmed the Cherokee treaty, on the 28th

day of May, 1828, with the following proviso: viz.--"Provided, never-

theless, that the said convention shall not be so construed as to extend

the northern boundary of the perpetual outlet west, provided for and

guarranteed in the second article of said convention, north of the 36th

deg. of north latitude, or so as to interfere with the lands assigned, or

to be assigned, west of the Mississippi river to the Creek Indians, who

have emigrated or may emigrate from the States of Georgia and Ala-

bama, under the provisions of any treaty or treaties heretofore con-

cluded between the United States and the Creek tribe of Indians: And

provided further, that nothing in the said convention shall be construed

to cede or assign to the Cherokees any lands heretofore ceded or assigned to any tribe or tribes of Indians, by any treaty now existing and in force, with any such tribe or tribes." And whereas the said proviso and ratification of the Cherokee treaty, was accepted by the delegates of the nation, then at the City of Washington as satisfactory to them, as is shown in and by their certain instrument in writing, bearing date the 31st day of May 1828, appended to and published with their treaty aforesaid. But, afterwards, the Cherokees of Arkansas and many of those residing east of the Mississippi at the time that treaty was concluded, removed to the country described in the second article of their treaty and settled upon a certain portion of the land claimed by the Creek Indians under their treaty provisions and stipulations. And whereas difficulties and dissensions thus arose between the Cherokees and Creek tribes about their boundary lines, which occasioned an appeal to the President of the United States for his interposition, and final settlement of the question, which they were unable to settle between themselves. And whereas the commissioners of the United States, whose names are signed hereto, in pursuance of the power and authority vested in them by the President of the United States, met the chiefs and head-men of the Cherokee and Creek nations of Indians, in council, on the 29th ultimo; and after a full and patient hearing and careful examination of all the claims, set up and brought forward by both the contending parties, they have this day effected an adjustment of all their difficulties, and have succeeded in defining and establishing boundary lines to their country west of the Mississippi, which have been acknowledged, in open council, this day, to be mutually satisfactory to both nations.
Now, therefore, for the purpose of securing the great objects contemplated by an amicable settlement of the difficulties heretofore existing between the Cherokee and Muskogee or Creek Indians, so injurious to both parties; and in order to establish boundary lines which will secure a country and permanent home to the whole Creek nation of Indians, including the Seminole nation who are anxious to join them, the undersigned commissioners, duly authorized to act on behalf of the United States, and the chiefs and head-men of the said Muskogee or Creek Indians, having full power and authority to act for their people west of the Mississippi, hereby agree to the following articles:
Art . I. The Muskogee or Creek nation of Indians, west of the Mississippi declare themselves to be the friends and allies of the United States, under whose parental care and protection they desire to continue: and that they are anxious to live in peace and friendship not, only with their near neighbors and brothers, the Cherokees, but with all the surrounding tribes of Indians.
Art . II. The United States hereby agree, by and with the consent of the Creek and Cherokee delegates, this day obtained, that the Muskogee or Creek country west of the Mississippi, shall be embraced within the following boundaries, viz :--Beginning at the mouth of the north fork of the Canadian river, and run northerly four miles--thence running a straight line so as to meet a line drawn from the south bank of the Arkansas river opposite to the east or lower bank of Grand river, at its junction with the Arkansas, and which runs a course south, 44 deg. west, one mile, to a post placed in the ground--thence along said line to the Arkansas, and up the same and the Verdigris river, to where the old territorial line crosses it--thence along said line north to a point twenty-five miles from the Arkansas river where the old territorial line crosses the same--thence running a line at right angles with the territorial line aforesaid, or west, to the Mexico line--thence along the said line southerly to the Canadian river or to the boundary of the Choctaw

country--thence down said river to the place of beginning. The lines, hereby defining the country of the Muskogee Indians on the north and east, bound the country of the Cherokees along these courses, as settled by the treaty concluded this day between the United States and that tribe.
Art . III. The United States will grant a patent, in fee simple, to the Creek nation of Indians for the land assigned said nation by this treaty or convention, whenever the same shall have been ratified by the President and Senate of the United States--and the right thus guarranteed by the United States shall be continued to said tribe of Indians, so long as they shall exist as a nation, and continue to occupy the country hereby assigned them.

U. S. will convey in fee simple.

Art . IV. It is hereby mutually understood and agreed between the parties to this treaty, that the land assigned to the Muskogee Indians, by the second article thereof, shall be taken and considered the property of the whole Muskogee or Creek nation, as well of those now residing upon the land, as the great body of said nation who still remain on the east side of the Mississippi: and it is also understood and agreed that the Seminole Indians of Florida, whose removal to this country is provided for by their treaty with the U. S. dated May 9th, 1832, shall also have a permanent and comfortable home on the lands hereby set apart as the country of the Creek nation : and they (the Seminoles) will hereafter be considered a constituent part of said nation, but are to be located on some part of the Creek country by themselves--which location will be selected for them by the commissioners who have signed these articles of agreement or convention.

The whole Creek, nation and the Seminoles interested.
Ante, p. 368.

Art . 5. As an evidence of the kind feeling of the United States towards the Muskogee Indians, and as a testimonial of the [their] gratification with the present amicable and satisfactory adjustment of their difficulties with the Cherokees, experienced by the commissioners, they agree on behalf of the United States, to furnish to the Creek Indians west of the Mississippi, one blacksmith and one wheelwright or wagonmaker, as soon as they may be required by the nation, in addition to those already employed -- also, to erect shops and furnish tools for the
same, and supply the smith shops with one ton of iron and two hundred and fifty pounds of steel each; and allow the said Creek Indians, annually, for education purposes, the sum of one thousand dollars, to be expended under the direction of the President of the United States-- the whole of the above grants to be continued so long as the President may consider them conducive to the interest and welfare of the Creek Indians: And the United States will also cause to be erected, as soon as conveniently can be done, four patent rail way mills, for grinding corn; and will immediately purchase for them twenty-four cross-cut saws. It being distinctly understood, however, that the grants thus made to the Creek Indians, by this article, are intended solely for the use and benefit of that portion of the Creek nation, who are now settled west of the Mississippi.
Art . VI. The United States agree that the improvements which the Creek Indians may be required to leave, in consequence of the boundary lines this day settled between their people and the Cherokees, shall be valued with as little delay as possible, and a fair and reasonable price paid for the same by the United States.

Additional blacksmith,&c. to be furnished by U. S.
Improvements left to be paid for.

Art . VII. It is hereby agreed by the Creek nation, parties hereto, that if the saline or salt plains on the great western prairies, should come within the boundaries defined by this agreement, as the country of the Creek nation, then, and in that case the President of the United
States, shall have the power to permit all other friendly Indian tribes to

Whe rea s , the Seminole Indians of Florida, entered into certain articles of agreement, with James Gadson, [Gadsden,] Commissioner on behalf of the United States, at Payne's landing, on the 9th day of May, 1832: the first article of which treaty or agreement provides, as follows : " The Seminoles Indians relinquish to the United States all claim to the land they at present occupy in the Territory of Florida, and agree to emigrate to the country assigned to the Creeks, west of the Mississippi river; it being understood that an additional extent of territory proportioned to their number will be added to the Creek country, and that the Seminoles will be received as a constituent part of the Creek nation, and be re-admitted to all the privileges as members of the same." And whereas, the said agreement also stipulates and provides, that a delegation of Seminoles should be sent at the expense of the United States to examine the country to be allotted them among the Creeks, and should this delegation be satisfied with the character of the country and of the favorable disposition of the Creeks to unite with them as one people, then the aforementioned treaty would be considered binding and obligatory upon the parties. And whereas a treaty was made between the United States and the Creek Indians west of the Mississippi, at Fort Gibson, on the 14th day of February 1833, by which a country was provided for the Seminoles in pursuance of the existing arrangements between the United States and that tribe. And whereas, the special delegation, appointed by the Seminoles on the 9th day of May 1832, have since examined the land designated for them by the undersigned Commissioners, on behalf of the United States, and have expressed themselves satisfied with the same, in and by their letter dated, March 1833, addressed to the undersigned Commissioners.
Now, therefore, the Commissioners aforesaid, by virtue of the power and authority vested in them by the treaty made with Creek Indians on the 14th of February 1833, as above stated, hereby designate and assign to the Seminole tribe of Indians, for their separate future residence, forever, a tract of country lying between the Canadian river and the north fork thereof, and extending west to where a line running north and south between the main Canadian and north branch, will strike the forks of Little river, provided said west line does not extend more than twenty-five miles west from the mouth of said Little river. And the undersigned Seminole chiefs, delegated as aforesaid, on behalf of their

Also the said commissioner shall examine whether three thousand dollars, a part of the sum of seventeen thousand dollars directed to be paid to Robert Stuart agent of the American Fur Company, was to be paid and received in full discharge of all claims and demands which said company had against Gurdon S. Hubbard and James Kinzie ; and if he finds it was to be so paid, that then the sum of fourteen thousand dollars, only, be paid, until said agent of said company give a receipt of all debts due, and demands which said
company had against said Hubbard and Kinzie; and, upon giving such receipt, that then the said sum of three thousand dollars be likewise paid to said agent."
And those contained in the second named resolution are as follows: " That the Senate do advise and consent to the alteration proposed by the Chiefs of the United Nation of Chippewa, Ottawa and Pottawattamie Indians, concluded at Chicago, in the State of Illinois, on the first day of October 1834, to the treaty concluded between the Commissioners on the part of the United States and the chiefs of the said United Nation on the 26th of September, 1833 it being expressly understood by the Senate that no other of the provisions of the resolution of the Senate of the 22d day of May 1834, ratifying the said treaty, shall be affected, or in any manner changed, by the said proposed alteration of 1st October, 1834, excepting the proposed alteration in the boundaries therein mentioned, and the sums of money therein stipulated to be paid."]

ARTICLES OF CONVENTION AND AGREEMENT

May 24, 1834. Proclamation, July 1, 1834.

Proposed by the Commissioners on the part of the United States, in pursuance of the request made, by the Delegation representing the Chickasaw nation of Indians, and which have been agreed to.

Peace and friendship. Indians about to remove, are to be protected by U. S.
U. S. to prevent intrusions on their lands.

Art . I. It is agreed that perpetual amity, peace and friendship, shall exist between the United States, and the Chickasaw nation of Indians.
Art . II. The Chickasaws are about to abandon their homes, which they have long cherished and loved; and though hitherto unsuccessful, they still hope to find a country, adequate to the wants and support of their people, somewhere west of the Mississippi and within the territorial limits of the United States; should they do so, the Government of the United States, hereby consent to protect and defend them against the inroads of any other tribe of Indians, and from the whites; and agree to keep them without the limits of any State or Territory. The Chickasaws pledge themselves never to make war upon any Indian people, or upon the whites, unless they are so authorised by the United States. But if war be made upon them, they will be permitted to defend themselves, until assistance, be given to them by the United States, as shall be the case.
Art . HI. The Chickasaws are not acquainted with the laws of the whites, which are extended over them; and the many intruders which break into their country, interupting their rights and disturbing their repose, leave no alternative whereby restraint can be afforded, other than an appeal to the military force of the country, which they are unwilling to ask for, or see resorted to; and therefore they agree to forbear such a request, for prevention of this great evil, with the understanding, which is admitted, that the agent of the United States, upon

Arti cle IV. If at any time hereafter, the Chiefs and Warriors, parties to this agreement, should feel disposed to migrate from the Territory of Florida to the country allotted to the Creeks and Seminoles in Arkansas; should they elect to sell their grants of land as provided for in the first article of this treaty, they must defray from the proceeds of the sales of said land, or from their private resources, all the expenses of their migration, subsistence, &c. But, if they prefer, they may, by surrendering to the U. States all the rights and privileges acquired under the provisions of this agreement, become parties to the obligations, provisions and stipulations of the treaty concluded at Payne's landing with the Seminoles on the 9th May 1832 as a constituent part of said tribe, and re-unite with said tribe in their new abode on the Arkansas, the United States, in that event agreeing to pay (3000) three thousand dollars for the reservation relinquished in the first article of this treaty; in addition to the rights and immunities the parties may acquire under the aforesaid treaty at Payne's landing.

Fath er : Feeling a disposition to comply with the resolution of Senate of the United States, and the views of the Government in relation to an alteration in the boundaries of the country ceded to the United nation of Chippewa, Ottawa, and Potawatamie Indians at the treaty at Chicago in the State of Illinois, concluded on the 26th and 27th days
of September 1833 :--we therefore propose as the chiefs of the said united nation, and for and on their behalf that we will accept of the following alteration in the boundaries of the said tract of country viz :--Beginning at the mouth of Boyer's river; thence down the Missouri river, to a point thereon; from which a due east line would strike the northwest corner of the State of Missouri; thence along the said east line, to the

TREATY WITH THE CHIPPEWAS, ETC. 1833.

447

northwest corner of said State; then along the northern boundary line of the said State of Missouri, till it strikes the line of the lands of the Sac and Fox Indians; thence northwardly along said line to a point from which a west line would strike the sources of the Little Sioux river; thence along said west line, till it strikes the said sources of said river; then down said river to its mouth; thence down the Missouri river, to the place of beginning: Provided the said boundary shall contain five million of acres; but should it contain more, then said boundaries are to be reduced so as to contain the said five millions of acres.
And, in consideration of the alteration of said boundary we ask that ten thousand dollars should be paid to such commissioner, as shall be designated by us to receive the same west of the Mississippi river, at such place on the tract of country ceded to the said united nation as we may designate, and to be applied, as we may direct for the use and benefit of the said nation. And the further sum of two thousand dollars to be paid to Gholson Kercheval, of Chicago, Ill: for services rendered the said united nation of Indians during the late war, between the U. S. Government and the Sacs and Foxes; and the further sum of one thousand dollars to George E. Walker for services rendered the said United nation, in bringing Indian prisoners, from west of the Mississippi river to Ottawa, Laselle county, UI. for whose appearance at the circuit court of said county, the said nation was bound.
The foregoing propositions are made with the expectation, that with the exception of the alteration in the proposed boundary, and the indemnity herein demanded as an equivalent for said exchange, the whole of the treaty made and concluded at this place on the 26th and 27th days of September 1833, be ratified as made and concluded at that time, within the space of five months from the present date ; otherwise it is our wish that the whole of the said treaty should be considered as cancelled.
In witness whereof, we, the undersigned chiefs of the said united nation of Chippewa, Ottowa and Potawatamie Indians, being specially delegated with power and authority to effect this negotiation, have hereto set our hands and seals at Chicago in the State of Illinois, on the first day of October, A. D., 1834.

One original is written in Siamese, the other in English ; but as the Siamese are ignorant of English, and the Americans of Siamese, a Portuguese and a Chinese translation are annexed, to serve as testimony to the contents of the treaty. The writing is of the same tenor and date in all the languages aforesaid: It is signed, on the one part, with the name of the Chau P'haya P'hra-klang, and sealed with the seal of the lotus flower, of glass; on the other part, it is signed with the name of Edmund Roberts, and sealed with a seal containing an eagle and stars.
One copy will be kept in Siam, and another will be taken by Edmund Roberts to the United States. If the Government of the United States shall ratify the said treaty, and attach the seal of the Government, then Siam will also ratify it on its part, and attach the seal of its Government.
