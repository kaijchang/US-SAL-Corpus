Preamble.

In accordance with a practice at once wise and beautiful, we have been accustomed , as the year is drawing to a close, to devote an occasion to the bumble expression of our thanks to Almighty God for the ceaseless and distinguished benefits bestowed upon us as a nation, and for His mercies and protection during the closing year.

Amid the rich and free enjoyment of all our advantages, we should not forget the source from whence they are derived, and the extent of our obligation to the Father of all mercies.
We have full reason to renew our thanks to Almighty God for favors bestowed upon us during the past year.

By His continuing mercy, civil and religious liberty have been maintained, peace has reigned within our borders, labor and enterprise have produced their merited rewards, and to His watchful providence we are indebted for security from pestilence and other national calamity.
Apart from national blessings, each individual among us has occasion to thoughtfully recall and devoutly recognize the favors and protection which he has enjoyed. Nov. 25, 1875, set Now, therefore, I , ULYSSES S. GRANT, President of the United States,

for a day ofthanks giving.

do recommend that on Thursday, the 25th day of November, the people of the United States, abstaining from all secular pursuits and from their accustomed avocations, do assemble in their respective places of worship, and, in such form as may seem most appropriate in their own hearts, offer to Almighty, God their acknowledgments and thanks for all His mercies, and their humble prayers for a continuance of His divine favor.

In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed .

The Centennial Anniversary of the day on which the people of the

United States declared their right to a separate and equal station
among the Powers of the Earth seems to demand an exceptional observance.

The founders of the Government at its birth and in its feebleness

invoked the blessings and the protection of a Divine Providence, and

the thirteen colonies and three millions of people have expanded into a nation of strength and numbers commanding the position which then

was asserted and for which fervent prayers were then offered. It seems fitting that on the occurrence of the hundreth anniversary

of our existence as a Nation a grateful acknowledgment should be

made to Almighty God for the protection and the bounties which He has vouchsafed to our beloved country.

the blessings which have been bestowed upon us as a Nation during the century of our existence, and humbly to invoke a continuance of His favor and of His protection.

Whereas it has been satisfactorily shown to me that insurrection and domestic violence exist in several counties of the State of South Caro-

cannot be convened in time to meet the present emergency, and the Executive of said State, under section 4 of Article IV of the Constitution of the United States and the laws passed in pursuance thereof,
has therefore made due application to me in the premises for such part of the military force of the United States as may be necessary and
adequate to protect said State and the citizens thereof against domes-
