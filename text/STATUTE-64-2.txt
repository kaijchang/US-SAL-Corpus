PATRIOTS' DAY CELEBRATION COMMISSION
(H. Oon. Res. 190]
Whereas the 19th day of April 1775 witnessed the first military en-
gagement between the American colonists and British troops, and
the fighting that then occurred at Concord and Lexington, in Massa-
chusetts, formed the prologue to the mighty drama of the Revolution
and determined the character of its first campaign; and
Whereas the significance of April 19 in the history of our country is
not to be measured by the extent of the military forces that engaged
in local battle in 1775, but by the direction and strength of the
intangible forces then set in motion which in due course established
the United States of America; and
Whereas a frequent recurrence to the events out of which this Nation
arose, and a better understanding of the principles upon which our
forefathers grounded their independence cannot fail to stimulate
and renew that high sense of patriotism which has ever been the
glory of our country; and
Whereas each such dramatic struggle onward in the process of world
civilization has been marked by a ceremonial indicating the formal
and official conclusion thereof, the first Commander in Chief and
General of the Continental Army purposely selected the 19th of
April as the date for a peace proclamation which he read to assembled
troops on April 19, 1783: Therefore be it
Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring),
Establishment of That there is hereby established a commission to be known as the
Patriots' Day Celebration Commission (hereinafter referred to as the
"Commission") and to be composed of eight Commissioners, as fol-
lows: Three Members of the Senate to be appointed by the Vice Presi-
dent and five Members of the House of Representatives to be appointed
by the Speaker of the House of Representatives. The Commissioners
shall serve without compensation and shall select a Chairman from
among their number.
SEC. 2. It shall be the duty of the Commission to prepare and carry
out a comprehensive plan for the observance and celebration of the
Commission.

FEDERAL CATALOG SYSTEM
а
a
Whereas the Congress believes that the development of a single supply
catalog system for all agencies of the Federal Government, both
civilian and military, is of vital necessity to the national security
and to the civilian economy; and
Whereas the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch
of the Government recommends that a declaration of congressional
policy be made to insure participation and cooperation of the mili-
tary and civilian agencies in the development of uniform property
identification; and
Whereas the Federal Supply Task Force of that Commission, among
other recommendations, stated that “the interests of national defense
and effective personal property management demand that a single
standard Federal Commodity Catalog be developed
that action by the Secretary of Defense should be taken to insure
that, after its preparation, it is used in all supply operations of all
bureaus, technical services, and commands without modification

Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring),
That it is the sense of the Congress that,
(1) The Secretary of Defense and the Administrator of General
Services shall, based on their respective responsibilities, expedite the
development of a coordinated plan looking to the completion of the
Federal Catalog System in order that there shall be published and
put into use at the earliest practicable moment a single supply catalog
system to be used by all departments of the National Military Estab-
lishment and by all civil agencies; and
(2) In order that these purposes may be achieved it is deemed
essential that such authority be vested in qualified personnel of the
National Military Establishment and the General Services Adminis-
tration with respect to cataloging and related supply activities as is
needed to insure the establishment of programs and priority schedules
for property identification and description work, and to insure that
cataloging operations in each bureau, technical service, command, or
civilian agency are carried on in accordance with established uniform
policies and approved priority schedules, and to provide the Congress
and the Bureau of the Budget with periodic reports showing the prog-
ress of the program as a whole as well as the progress made by each
bureau, technical service, or command with the assignments made to
(3) In the Federal Catalog System each property item shall have
but one name and one description and one item identification number;
and
(4) The Federal Catalog System shall provide a classification sys-
tem or systems suitable for
all supply purposes; and
(5). The Federal Catalog System shall identify, classify, and
describe the millions of items of personal property used by all agencies
and will provide a standard reference language or terminology to be
used by all persons engaged in the process of supply (computation of
requirements in relation to inventories and operating programs, pro-
curement, distribution, storage, disposal, budgeting, and accounting);
and
(6) Reports and records of Federal agencies concerning supply
operations and property management, including production, export,
import, procurement, distribution, utilization, and disposal of com-
modities shall be made in terms of the nomenclature of the Federal
Catalog System; and
(7) In order to prevent duplication of functions, cataloging tasks
will be assigned to technical services, bureaus, commands, and civilian
agencies by a central cataloging authority. Effectuation of the pur-
poses of this resolution will require that each technical service, bureau,
command, and civilian agency accept and promptly complete catalog-
ing task assignments. In discharging its responsibility under the
program each technical service, bureau, command, or civilian agency
shail consult with other interested services, bureaus, commands, or
agencies, as it deems appropriate or as directed by central authority;
and
(8) The Secretary of Defense and the Administrator of General
Services shall develop a coordinated publication plan which will insure
that identification and description data, wherever developed, shall be
published in a uniform manner; but each technical service, bureau,
command, or civilian agency shall utilize pertinent uniform identifi-
cation or description material for inclusion in its own catalogs, unit
publications, or technical handbooks.

But excepting therefrom that area of land and water within the
record meander line of Malheur Lake, bounded and described as
follows:
Beginning at corner No. 1, in the record meander line (known as the Neal
survey line) of T. 25 S., R. 3242 E. (north of Malheur Lake), in the south
boundary of fractional sec. 29, at the corner common to lots one (1) and two
(2) of said fractional section;
Thence in Malheur Lake, South approximately 316.50 chs., N. 64°45' E.,
approximately 314.00 chs., to the east side of the borrow pit on the east side
of Cole Island Dike, Northerly with the east side of said borrow pit with the
meanders thereof approximately 197.00 chs., to the record meander line (known
as the Neal survey line) of T. 25 S., R. 3212 E. (north of Malheur Lake),
the corner common to fractional sections 23, 25 and 26 and section 24,
Thence westerly with the aforesaid record meander line, along the south
boundary of fractional sections 26, 23, 22, 27, 28, 21, 20 and 29, approximately
512.00 chs. to the place of beginning.
This regulation shall become effective on October 21, 1949, and it
shall on that date supersede the regulation dated October 5, 1948,
designating as a closed area certain lands and waters in Harney
County, Oregon, approved by the President by Proclamation No.
62 Stat., Pt. 2, p. 1565. 2818 of October 20, 1948.
Compliance with the provisions of section 4 (c) of the Administra-
tive Procedure Act (60 Stat. 238; 5 U. S. C. 1003) with respect to
delayed effective date is impracticable and contrary to the public
interest in this instance because the hunting season for migratory
waterfowl in the State of Oregon opens on October 21, 1949, and the
purposes of the regulation cannot be fully accomplished unless the
regulation is effective at the beginning of such hunting season.

17th day of October 1949.

We are thankful that our resources enable us to aid the peoples of
other countries in the furtherance of economic well-being and security.
We deeply appreciate the strength of our democratic institutions
and the preservation of those ideals of liberty and justice which form
the basis of national stability and international peace. The times
demand more than the wisdom of man can provide. There should
be in the hearts of all good men and true a realization that as the
Psalmist said: “There is no king saved by the multitude of an host:
a mighty man is not delivered by much strength.” Humbly grateful
for these benefactions, may we add to our prayers of thanksgiving a
plea for divine guidance of the leaders of our nation and the leaders
of all other nations in their efforts to promote peace and freedom for
all men.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, HARRY S. TRUMAN, President of the Thursday, Nov. 24,
,
United States of America, having in mind the joint congressional of national thanksgiv-
resolution of December 26, 1941, which made the fourth Thursday ingi
in November a legal holiday, do hereby proclaim Thursday, Novem-
ber 24, 1949, as Thanksgiving Day, and I urge all citizens to observe
the day with reverence. Let us, on the appointed day, in our homes
and in our accustomed places of Worship, give thanks to Almighty
God for the blessings which have signalized our lot as a Nation, and
let us ask for the gift of wisdom in our striving for a better world.

Observance of Me-
morial Day.
>
Since war is the world's most terrible scourge, we should do all
in our power to prevent its recurrence.
It was the hope of mankind that with the cessation of hostilities
of World War II the way would be open to founding a permanent
peace. Instead, that war has left the world in a state of continued
unrest. Accordingly, we feel the need of turning in humble suppliance
to Almighty God for help and guidance.
In recognition of this need, the Congress has fittingly provided,
in a joint resolution which I approved on May 11, 1950, that Memorial
Ι
Day, which has long been set aside for paying tribute to those who
lost their lives in war, shall henceforth be dedicated also as a day for
Nation-wide prayer for permanent peace. The Congress has also
requested that the President issue a proclamation calling upon the
people
of the United States to observe Memorial Day in that manner.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, HARRY S. TRUMAN, President of the
United States of America, pursuant to the aforementioned resolution,
do hereby proclaim Memorial Day, Tuesday, May 30, 1950, and each
succeeding
Memorial Day, as a day of prayer for permanent peace.
And I designate the hour beginning at eleven o'clock in the morning
of that day, Eastern Daylight Saving Time, as a period in which
all our people may unite in prayer, each in accordance with his own
religious faith, for divine aid in bringing enduring peace to a
troubled world.
I also request the agencies of the press, radio, television, and other
media of public information to join in the observance of that day
and of the specified hour by announcements and programs designed
to unite the Nation in a universal prayer for permanent peace.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand and
caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 22nd day of May in the

WHEREAS, in commemoration of the establishment of the organi-
zation, the General Assembly of the United Nations in a resolution
of October 31, 1947, declared that October 24 of each year should
thenceforth be known as United Nations Day and should be devoted
to the spread of information about the aims and accomplishments
of the United Nations, with a view to gaining popular support for
its work:
NOW, THEREFORE, I, HARRY S. TRUMAN, President of
the United States of America, do hereby call upon all the people of
this Nation to observe October 24, 1950, as United Nations Day with
solemn awareness of the responsibility of each individual for
strengthening the devotion of the peoples of the world to the aims
of the United Nations.
And I urge that officials of the Federal, State, and local Govern-
I
ments, representatives of civic, educational, and religious bodies, and
agencies of the press, radio, television, and other media of public
information, arrange for ceremonies and programs on United Nations
Day, designed to inform our citizens more fully of the activities of
the United Nations, through which, by united effort, enduring world
peace may be achieved.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand and
caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.

fires in our homes, in our industrial plants, and in our communities
generally. I request that State and local Governments, the American
National Red Cross, the National Fire Waste Council, the Chamber
of Commerce of the United States, business, labor, and farm organiza-
tions, churches, schools, civic groups, and the agencies of public in-
formation, including newspapers, magazines, and the radio, television,
and motion-picture industries, cooperate fully in the observance of
Fire Prevention Week. I also direct the appropriate agencies of
the Federal Government to assist in this crusade against the toll of
life and property resulting from fires.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand and
caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE in the City of Washington this 21st day of August in the
year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty, and of the
(SEAL] Independence of the United States of America the one
hundred and seventy-fifth.

Provided, however, That whenever the Director of the Fish and
Wildlife Service shall find that emergency State action to prevent
forest fires in any extensive area has resulted in the shortening of the
season during which the hunting of any migratory game bird is per-
mitted and that a compensatory extension or reopening of the hunting
season for such birds will not result in a diminution of the abundance
of birds to any greater extent than that contemplated for the original
hunting season, the hunting season for the birds so affected may,
subject to all other provisions of this subchapter, be extended or
reopened by the Director upon request of the chief officer of the agency
of the State exercising administration over wildlife resources. The
Director of the Fish and Wildlife Service shall fix the length of the
extended or reopened season, which in no event shall exceed the num-
ber of days during which hunting has been so prohibited, and he shall
publicly announce the extended or reopened season.

(a) or (b) of this section, may be possessed in any State, District of
Columbia, Alaska, or Puerto Rico during the open season where taken
and for an additional 90 days next succeeding the said open season.
For the purposes of these regulations the ownership and possession
of birds legally taken by any hunter shall be deemed to have ceased
when such birds have been delivered by him to (1) a post office, (2) a
common carrier, or (3) a locker, storage plant, or similar facility for
transportation to some person other than the hunter or a member of
the hunter's immediate household. As used in this section, "locker,
storage plant, or similar facility” includes only those facilities as are
engaged in the business of receiving and handling birds and keep and
make available for inspection by any officer authorized to enforce
these regulations at any reasonable time records showing the names
and addresses of both the consignors and the consignees of such birds.
5. Section 6.10, including its title, is amended to read as follows:
8 6.10 Revocation of certain existing permits. Permits which
were issued prior to July 1, 1949, which bear no expiration date, and
which authorize the possession of waterfowl for propagating purposes
or the taking of migratory birds for scientific purposes, not including
permits to band birds, are hereby revoked as of November 1, 1950.

means.
As previously indicated in notices published in the Federal Register
on July 7, 1950, and August 8, 1950, pursuant to Section 4 of the Ad-
ministrative Procedure Act of June 11, 1946 (60 Stat. 238), the breed-
ing habits of many species of migratory birds, particularly waterfowl,
are such that a comprehensive analysis of the various factors affecting
the current year's abundance and distribution of such birds should
not be considered earlier than the first week of August of each year.
At the same time such notices stated that information then available
regarding the distribution and abundance of doves, rails, and galli-
nules, and waterfowl in certain geographical areas, permitted the
inclusion in those notices of schedules showing the proposed Septem-
ber open seasons, and related bag and possession limits, on such birds.
The information contained in the schedules also was furnished to ap-
propriate State game officials and to the public by publication in
widely distributed newspapers and other publications and by other
The open seasons, daily bag and possession limits, and other
limitations specified in the notice of July 7, as modified by the notice
of August 8, now have been included without change in the above
amendments. In these circumstances, it has been determined that the
public interests will best be served if those portions of section 6.3,
Means by which migratory game birds may be taken, and section 6.4,
Open seasons, bag limits, and possession of certain migratory game
birds, relating to (1) rails and gallinules; (2) doves (whitewinged,
mourning or turtle); (3) band-tailed pigeons; (4) waterfowl in
Alaska; (5) scoter, eider, and old squaw ducks in Connecticut, Maine,
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, and Rhode Island be-
come effective September 1, 1950. The remainder of the amendments,
which particularly affect 'waterfowl and are related to seasons be-
ginning later than September 30, 1950, become effective October 1,
1950.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto subscribed my name
and caused the seal of the Department of the Interior to be affixed,

WHERÊAS the limitation on the entry of cotton having a staple

based thereon, together with a transcript of the evidence submitted at

WHEREAS the Commission has recommended that an additional
quantity of 1,500,000 pounds of harsh or rough cotton (except cotton

NOW THEREFORE, I, HARRY S. TRUMAN, President of the

the said supplemental investigation and report of the United States

in part and modified, so as to permit the entry for consumption, or
withdrawal from warehouse for consumption, during the quota year

more but less than 13 inches in length, in addition to the quantity
of cotton having a staple of 148 inches or more but less than 111/16
inches in length the entry of which has already been made during the
said quota year under the said proclamation of September 5, 1939,
as suspended in part and modified, which additional quantity I find
should be permitted entry to carry out the purposes of section 22 of
the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, as amended. Accordingly,
pursuant to the said section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of
64 Stat., Pt. 1, p.281. 1933, as amended, I hereby modify the said proclamation of Septem-
ber 5, 1939, so as to permit during the quota year ending at the close
of January 31, 1951, the entry for consumption, or withdrawal from
warehouse for consumption, of an additional quantity of 1,500,000
pounds of harsh or rough cotton (except cotton of perished staple,
grabbots, and cotton pickings), white in color, and having a staple of
1316 inches or more but less than 138 inches in length, which addi-
Declaration of Con- tional quantity I hereby find and declare may be entered for con-
sumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, during
such quota year without rendering or tending to render ineffective or
materially interfering with the domestic program undertaken with
respect to cotton, or reducing substantially the amount of any product
processed in the United States from cotton produced in the United
States.
This proclamation shall become effective on the fifth day after the
date thereof.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand and
caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.

ber 5, 1939 (No. 2351, 54 Stat. 2640), limiting the quantities of certain
cotton and cotton waste which might be entered, or withdrawn from

WHEREAS the said proclamation of September 5, 1939, as sus-
54 Stat., Pt.2,p.1631.
pended in part and modified, provides that the total quantity of
cotton having a staple of 148 inches or more but less than 111/16 inches
in length which may be entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for
consumption in any year commencing February 1 shall not exceed
45,656,420 pounds; and
WHEREAS the limitation on the entry of cotton having a staple
of 148 inches or more in length was imposed by the said proclama-
tion of September 5, 1939 after a finding
by the President, on the
basis of an investigation and report of the United States Tariff Com-
mission made under the provisions of the said section 22 of the Agri-
cultural Adjustment Act of 1933, as amended, that such cotton was
being imported into the United States under such conditions and
in sufficient quantities as to tend to render ineffective or materially
interfere with the program undertaken with respect to cotton under
the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act, as amended; and
WHEREAS the imposition of annual quotas on cotton having a
staple of 11/8 inches or more in length was recommended by the
United States Tariff Commission in its report (Report No. 137, 2d
Series) in connection with which it was stated, in finding No. 5, that
the quotas recommended "will prevent imports from interfering with
the cotton program and at the same time will permit American in-
dustry to secure needed supplies of specialized types of cotton”; and
WHEREAS the total quantity of cotton having a staple of 138
inches or more but less than 111/16 inches in length which may be
entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consump-
tion, under the said proclamation of September 5, 1939, as suspended 54 Stat., Pt.2,p.2840.
in part and modified, during the quota year ending at the close of
January 31, 1951, has already been entered, or withdrawn from ware-
house, for consumption; and
WHEREAS pursuant to the said section 22 of the Agricultural
Adjustment Act of 1933, as further amended by the acts of January
25, 1940, 54 Stat. 17, and July 3, 1948, 62 Stat. 1247, 1248, and by
Public Law 579, 81st Congress, approved June 28, 1950, the United
States Tariff Commission has made a supplemental investigation to
determine whether an additional quantity of cotton having a staple
of 138 inches or more but less than 111/18 inches in length should be
permitted to be entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consump-
tion during the remainder of the quota year ending at the close of
January 31, 1951; and
WHÈREAS in the course of the said supplemental investigation,
after due notice, a public hearing was held on September 29, 1950,
at which parties interested were given opportunity to be present, to
produce evidence, and to be heard, and, in addition to the hearing,
the Commission made such investigation as it deemed necessary for
a full disclosure and presentation of the facts; and

WHEREAS the Commission has made findings of fact and has
transmitted to me a report of such findings and its recommendations
based thereon, together with a transcript of the evidence submitted
at the hearing, and has also transmitted a copy of such report to the
Secretary of Agriculture; and
WHEREAS the Commission has recommended that an additional
quantity not to exceed 7,500,000 pounds of cotton having a staple of
138 inches or more but less than 111/16 inches in length be permitted
entry during the quota year ending at the close of January 31, 1951,
and that imports under this supplemental quota should be permitted
under license only to the extent determined to be necessary to satisfy
the essential needs of individual cotton manufacturing concerns:
NOW, THEREFORE, I, HARRY S. TRUMAN, President of the
United States of America, do hereby find and declare, on the basis
of the investigation and report of the United States Tariff Commis-
sion, that changed circumstances require the modification, as here-
54 Stat.,Pt.2, p.2840. inafter set forth, of the said proclamation of September 5, 1939, as
suspended in part and modified, to carry out the purposes of the said
64 Stat., Pt. 1, p. 261. section 22. Accordingly, pursuant to the said section 22, I hereby
modify the said proclamation of September 5, 1939, so as to permit
during the remainder of the quota year ending at the close of January
31, 1951, the entry for consumption, or withdrawal from warehouse
for consumption, in accordance with the essential needs of persons or
firms engaged in cotton manufacturing, as determined by the Tariff
Commission, of an additional quantity up to but not exceeding a total
aggregate quantity of 7,500,000 pounds of cotton having a staple
of 13% inches or more but less than 11116 inches in length:
Provided,
That no portion of such additional quantity of cotton shall be per-
mitted entry for consumption, or withdrawal from warehouse for
consumption, except by or for the account of a person or firm en-
gaged in cotton manufacturing to whom the Tariff Commission has
issued a license and subject to the limitations specified in such license.
I hereby find and declare that the said additional quantity may
be entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for con-
sumption, during the remainder of the quota year ending at the close
of January 31, 1951 without rendering or tending to render ineffective
or materially interfering with the domestic program undertaken with
respect to cotton, or reducing substantially the amount of any product
processed in the United States from cotton produced in the United
States.
The Tariff Commission is authorized to adopt such procedure and
rules and regulations as it considers necessary to assure the equitable
distribution of the said additional quantity of cotton among essential
users of such cotton.
This
proclamation shall become effective immediately.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand and
caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 12th day of October in the

1950, proclaimed a day
>
ing
In keeping with the custom established by our forefathers and hal-
lowed by faithful observance throughout the years, it is fitting that
once again at this season we set aside a day for giving thanks to God
for the many blessings which He has bestowed upon us.
We are deeply grateful for the bounties of our soil, for the un-
equalled production of our mines and factories, and for all the vast
resources of our beloved country, which have enabled our citizens to
build a great civilization. We are thankful for the enjoyment of our
personal liberties and for the loyalty of our fellow Americans.
We offer fervent thanks that we are privileged to join with other
countries in the work of the United Nations, which was founded to
maintain peace in a troubled world and is now standing firm in up-
holding the principles of international justice.
Contemplating these blessings with humility, we have a deepened
sense of our responsibility to serve unselfishly, and we pray to
Almighty God for wisdom in our relations with our fellow men.
Thursday, Nov. 23,
NOW, THEREFORE, I, HARRY S. TRUMAN, President of the
of national thanksgiv. United States of America, in conformance with the joint resolution of
Congress approved December 26, 1941, designating the fourth Thurs-
day of November in each year as Thanksgiving Day, do hereby pro-
claim Thursday, November 23, 1950, as a day of national thanksgiving,
and I call upon every citizen to offer thanks to God for His gracious
guidance and help. Again I ask all my countrymen to appeal to the
Most High, that the God of our Fathers who has blessed this land
beyond all others will in His infinite mercy grant to all nations that
peace which the world cannot give. I entreat them, in church, chapel
and synagogue, in their homes and in the busy walks of life, every day
and everywhere, to pray for peace.
.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand and
caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.

ported into the territory of that contracting party in such increased
quantities and under such conditions as to cause or threaten serious
injury to domestic producers in that territory of like or directly
competitive products, the contracting party shall be free, in respect
of such product, and to the extent and for such time as may be
necessary to prevent or remedy such injury, to suspend the obliga-
tion in whole or in part or to withdraw or modify the concession.
(b) If any product, which is the subject of a concession with
respect to a preference, is being imported into the territory of
a contracting party in the circumstances set forth in sub-para-
graph (a) of this paragraph, so as to cause or threaten serious
injury to domestic producers of like or directly competitive prod-
ucts in the territory of a contracting party which receives or
received such preference, the importing contracting party shall
be free, if that other contracting party so requests, to suspend
the relevant obligation in whole or in part or to withdraw or
modify the concession in respect of the product, to the extent and
for such time as may be necessary to prevent or remedy such
injury.
2. Before any contracting party shall take action pursuant to
the provisions of paragraph 1 of
this Article, it shall give notice
in writing to the CONTRACTING PARTIES as far in advance
as may be practicable and shall afford the CONTRACTING
PARTIES and those contracting parties having a substantial in-

is given in relation to a concession with respect to a preference, the
notice shall name the contracting party which has requested the
action. In critical circumstances, where delay would cause dam-
age which it would be difficult to repair, action under paragraph 1
of this Article may be taken provisionally without prior consulta-

after taking such action.
3. (a) If agreement among the interested contracting parties
with respect to the action is not reached, the contracting party
which proposes to take or continue the action shall, nevertheless, be
free to do so, and if such action is taken or continued, the affected
contracting parties shall then be free, not later than ninety days
after such action is taken, to suspend, upon the expiration of thirty

Article without prior consultation and causes or threatens serious
injury in the territory of a contracting party to the domestic
producers of products affected by the action, that contracting
party shall, where delay would cause damage difficult to repair,

Britain and Northern Ireland, which trade agreement consists of
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the related Protocol
of Provisional Application thereof, together with the Final Act
Adopted at the Conclusion of the Second Session of the Preparatory
Committee of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Employ-
ment which authenticated the texts of the said General Agreement

strictions, and to this end shall observe the following provisions:

61 Stat., Pt. 5, p. A40.
618tat., Pt. 5, p. 141.
“(d) in cases in which a quota is allocated among supplying
countries, the contracting party applying the restrictions may
seek agreement with respect to the allocation of shares in the
quota with all other contracting parties having a substantial
interest in supplying the product concerned. In cases in which
this method is not reasonably practicable, the contracting party
concerned shall allot to contracting parties having a substantial
interest in supplying the product shares based upon the propor-
tions, supplied by such contracting parties during a previous rep-
resentative period, of the total quantity or value of imports of the
product, due account being taken of any special factors which
may have affected or may be affecting the trade in the product.
No conditions or formalities shall be imposed which would pre-
vent any contracting party from utilizing fully the share of any
such total quantity or value which has been allotted to it, sub-
ject to importation being made within any prescribed period to
which the quota may relate.
61 Stat., Pt. 5, A42.
“3. (c) In the case of quotas allocated among supplying coun-
tries, the contracting party applying the restrictions shall promptly
inform all other contracting parties having an interest in supply-
ing the product concerned of the shares in the quota currently al-
located, by quantity or value, to the various supplying countries
and shall give public notice thereof.
