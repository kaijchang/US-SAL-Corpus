(a) The act of Congress, entitled " An act to create additional land districts in the states of Illinois and Missouri," approved June 26, 1834, ch. 76, does not require the President of the United States to cause to be offered for sale the public lands containing lead mines, situated in the land districts created by that act. The United States v. Gear, 3 Howard, 120.
The act does notrequire the President to cause the land containing lead mines to be sold, as the fifth section of the act of March 3, 1807, entitled "An act making provision for the disposal of the public lands, situated between the United States' tract and the Connecticut reserve, and for other purposes," is in full force. Ibid.
The lands containing lead mines, in the Indiana territory, or that part of it made into the new land districts, by the act of June 26th, 1834, are not subject to a pre-emption by settlers upon the public lands, under any of the pre-emption laws which have been passed by Congress. Ibid.
The fourth section of the act of 1834 does in no way repeal any part of the fifth section of the act of March 3, 1807, ch. 49, by which the lands containing lead mines were reserved for the future disposal of the United States, in which section it is declared that grants for lead mine tracts, discovered to be such before they may be bought from the United States, are declared to be fraudulent and null; and which authorized the President to lease any lead mine which had been, or might be discovered in the Indiana territory, for a term not exceeding five years. Ibid.
The land containing lead mines, in the districts made by the act of 1834, are not subject to pre-emption and sale under any of the existing acts of Congress. Ibid.
Digging lead ore from the lead mines upon the public land of the United States, is such a waste as entitles the United States to a writ of injunction to restrain it. Ibid.

Sec . 4. And be it further enacted, That the President shall be authorized, so soon as the survey shall have been completed, to cause to be offered for sale, in the manner prescribed by law, all the lands lying in said land districts, at the land offices in the respective districts in which the land so offered is embraced, reserving only section sixteen in each township, the tract reserved for the village of Galena, such other tracts as have been granted to individuals and the state of Illinois, and such reservations as the President shall deem necessary to retain for military posts, any law of Congress heretofore existing to the contrary notwithstanding.
Sec . 5. And be it further enacted, That so much of the public lands of the United States, in the state of Missouri, as lies west of the range line between ranges ten and eleven west of the fifth principal meridian, and south of the line dividing townships, numbers forty and forty-one north of the base line, shall form a new land district, to be called the south-western land district; and for the sale of the public lands within the district aforesaid, there shall be a land office established at such place within said district as the President of the United States may designate.
Sec . 6. And be it further enacted, That there shall be a register and receiver appointed to said office, to superintend the sale of public land in said district, who shall reside at the place where said office is established, give security in the same manner and sums, and whose compensation, emoluments, duties, and authorities, shall in every respect be the same in relation to lands to be disposed of at said office, as are, or may be, by law provided, in relation to the registers and receivers of public money in the several offices established for the sale of the public lands.
Sec . 7. And be it further enacted, That all such public lands embraced within the district created by this act, which shall have been offered for sale to the highest bidder at the several land offices, at Jackson, Franklin, Fayette, and Lexington, pursuant to any proclamation of the President of the United States, and which lands remain unsold at the taking effect of this act, shall be subject to be entered and sold at private sale, by the proper officers of the office hereby created, in the same manner and subject to the same terms, and upon like conditions, as the sale of said land would have been subject to, in the said several land offices hereinbefore mentioned, had they remained attached to the same: Provided, That nothing in this act shall be so construed as to permit the officers appointed in either of the foregoing land districts to receive compensation out of the treasury of the United States.

(b) The decisions of the Supreme Court upon the compacts between states have been :--

The compact of 1789, between Virginia and Kentucky, was valid under that provision of the consti-

tution which declares, that " no state shall, without the consent of Congress, enter into agreement or

Compact with another state, or with a foreign power:" no particular mode, in which that consent must

be given, having been prescribed by the constitution ; and Congress having consented to the admission

of Kentucky into the Union, as a sovereign state, upon the conditions in the compact. Green v. Biddle,

8 Wheat. 1; 5 Cond. Rep. 369.

The compact is not invalid upon the ground of its surrendering rights of sovereignty, which are inalienable. Ibid.

To bring a case within the protection of the seventh article in the compact between Virginia and

Kentucky, it must be shown that the title to the land asserted, is derived from the laws of Virginia, prior

to the separation of the two states. Lessee of Fisher v. Cockerell, 5 Peters, 247.

The construction of a compact between the states of Virginia and Pennsylvania, is not to be settled

by the laws or decisions of either of those states, but by the compact itself. Marlatt v. Silk et al.,

11 Peters, 1.

,

The decision of a question of the construction of such a compact, is not to be attested from the deci-

sions of either state, but. is one of an international character. Ibid.

It is a part of the general right of sovereignty, belonging to independent nations, to establish and

fix the disputed boundaries between the respective limits; and the boundaries so established and fixed by

compact between nations, become conclusive upon all the subjects and citizens thereof, and bind their

rights ; and are to be treated, to all intents and purposes, as the real boundaries. This right is expressly

recognised to exist in the states of the Union, by the constitution of the United States; and is guarded

in its exercise by a single limitation or restriction, only, requiring the consent of Congress. Ibid.

The compact between New Jersey and Pennsylvania, recognises the right of fishery in riparian own-

ers on the Delaware. Bennet v. Boggs, Baldwin's C. C. R. 60.

The plaintiffs, in the circuit court of West Tennessee, instituted an ejectment for a tract of land held

under a Virginia military land warrant, situate south of a line called Mathews' line, and south of

Walker's line ; the latter being the established boundaries between the states of Kentucky and Tennes-

see, as fixed by a compact between those states, made in 1820; by which compact, although the juris-

diction over the territory to the south of Walker's line, was acknowledged to belong to Tennessee, the

titles to lands held under Virginia military land warrants, &c. ; and grants from Kentucky, as far south

as " Mathews' line," were declared to be confirmed : the state of Kentucky having, before the com-

The act of 1834, ch. 132, does not repeal the first section of the act of 1818, ch. 64, regulating the pay and emoluments of brevet officers. Ibid.

The fifth section of the act of June 30, 1834, ch. 132, is a repeal of the joint resolution of the two

houses of Congress of May 25, 1832, respecting the pay and emoluments of the marine corps. Ibid.

By force of the army regulation No. 1125, authorizing the issue of double rations to officers command-

ing departments, posts, and arsenals, a brevet field officer of marines is entitled to double rations. But

the fact must be shown that he had such a command of a post or arsenal at which double rations had been allowed according to the army regulations. Ibid.

The fact of appropriations having been made by Congress for double rations does not determine what officers are entitled to them. Ibid.

A brevet field officer of the marine corps, commanding a separate post, without a command equal to

his brevet rank, is not entitled to his brevet pay and emoluments. But if such brevet officer is a captain

in the line of his corps, and in the actual command of a company, whether he is in the command of a

post or not, he is entitled to the compensation given by the act of March 2, 1827, ch. 42. Ibid.

The compact of 1789, between Virginia and Kentucky, was valid under that provision of the consti-

tution which declares, that " no state shall, without the consent of Congress, enter into agreement or

Compact with another state, or with a foreign power:" no particular mode, in which that consent must

be given, having been prescribed by the constitution ; and Congress having consented to the admission

of Kentucky into the Union, as a sovereign state, upon the conditions in the compact. Green v. Biddle,

8 Wheat. 1; 5 Cond. Rep. 369.

The compact is not invalid upon the ground of its surrendering rights of sovereignty, which are inalienable. Ibid.

To bring a case within the protection of the seventh article in the compact between Virginia and

Kentucky, it must be shown that the title to the land asserted, is derived from the laws of Virginia, prior

to the separation of the two states. Lessee of Fisher v. Cockerell, 5 Peters, 247.

The construction of a compact between the states of Virginia and Pennsylvania, is not to be settled

by the laws or decisions of either of those states, but by the compact itself. Marlatt v. Silk et al.,

11 Peters, 1.

,

The decision of a question of the construction of such a compact, is not to be attested from the deci-

sions of either state, but. is one of an international character. Ibid.

It is a part of the general right of sovereignty, belonging to independent nations, to establish and

fix the disputed boundaries between the respective limits; and the boundaries so established and fixed by

compact between nations, become conclusive upon all the subjects and citizens thereof, and bind their

rights ; and are to be treated, to all intents and purposes, as the real boundaries. This right is expressly

recognised to exist in the states of the Union, by the constitution of the United States; and is guarded

in its exercise by a single limitation or restriction, only, requiring the consent of Congress. Ibid.

The compact between New Jersey and Pennsylvania, recognises the right of fishery in riparian own-

ers on the Delaware. Bennet v. Boggs, Baldwin's C. C. R. 60.

The plaintiffs, in the circuit court of West Tennessee, instituted an ejectment for a tract of land held

under a Virginia military land warrant, situate south of a line called Mathews' line, and south of

Walker's line ; the latter being the established boundaries between the states of Kentucky and Tennes-

see, as fixed by a compact between those states, made in 1820; by which compact, although the juris-

diction over the territory to the south of Walker's line, was acknowledged to belong to Tennessee, the

titles to lands held under Virginia military land warrants, &c. ; and grants from Kentucky, as far south

as " Mathews' line," were declared to be confirmed : the state of Kentucky having, before the com-

of New Jersey, for the purpose of agreeing upon and settling the jurisdiction and territorial limits of the two states, have executed certain articles, which are contained in the words following, viz :
Agreement made and entered into by and between Benjamin F. Butler, Peter Augustus Jay and Henry Seymour, commissioners duly appointed on the part and behalf of the state of New York, in pursuance of an act of the legislature of the said state, entitled " An act concerning the territorial limits and jurisdiction of the state of New York and the state of New Jersey, passed January 18th, 1833, of the one part; and Theodore Frelinghuysen, James Parker, and Lucius Q. C. Elmer, commissioners duly appointed on the part and behalf of the state of New Jersey, in pursuance of an act of the legislature of the said state, entitled " An act for the settlement of the territorial limits and jurisdiction between the states of New Jersey and New York," passed February 6th, 1833, of
the other part. Arti cle Firs t . The boundary line between the two states of New
York and New Jersey, from a point in the middle of Hudson river, opposite the point on the west shore thereof, in the forty-first degree of north latitude, as heretofore ascertained and marked, to the main sea, shall be the middle of the said river, of the Bay of New York, of the waters between Staten Island and New Jersey, and of Raritan Bay, to the main sea; except as hereinafter otherwise particularly mentioned.
Arti cle Secon d . The state of New York shall retain its present jurisdiction of and over Bedlow's and Ellis's islands; and shall also retain exclusive jurisdiction of and over the other islands lying in the waters above mentioned and now under the jurisdiction of that state.
Article Third . The state of New York shall have and enjoy exclusive jurisdiction of and over all the waters of the bay of New York ; and of and overall the waters of Hudson river lying west of Manhattan Island

pact, claimed the right to the soil, as well as the jurisdiction over the territory, and having granted lands in the same. The compact of 1820 was confirmed by Congress. The defendants in the ejectment claimed the lands under titles emanating from the state of North Carolina, in 1786, 1794, 1795; before the formation of the state of Tennessee ; and grants from the state of Tennessee, in 1809, 1811, 1812, 1814, in which the lands claimed by the defendants were situated, according to the boundary of the state of Tennessee, declared and established at a time when the state of Tennessee became one ofthe states of the United States. The circuit court instructed the jury that the state of Tennessee, by sanctioning the compact, admitted, in the most solemn form, that the lands in dispute were not within her jurisdiction, nor within the jurisdiction of North Carolina, at the time they were granted; and that, consequently, the titles are subject to the compact: Held, by the Supreme Court, that the instructions of the circuit court were entirely correct. Poole v. Fleeger, 11 Peters, 185.
The seventh article of the compact between Virginia and Kentucky declares " all private rights and interests of lands within the said district (Kentucky,) derived from the laws of Virginia, prior to such separation, shall remain valid and secure under the laws of the proposed state, and shall be determined by the laws now existing in this state (Virginia)." Whatever course of legislation, by Kentucky, would be sanctioned by the principles and practice of Virginia, should be regarded as an unaffected compliance with the compact. Such are all reasonable quieting statutes. Hawkins v. Barney's Lessee, 5 Peters, 457.
From as early a date as the year 1705, Virginia has never been without an act of limitation ; and no class of laws is more universally sanctioned by the practice of nations, and the consent of mankind, than those laws which give peace and confidence to the actual possessor and tiller of the soil. Such laws have frequently passed in review before the Supreme Court; and occasions have occurred in which they have been particularly noticed, as laws not to he impeached on the ground of violating private rights. It is impossible to take any reasonable exception to the course of legislation pursued by Kentucky on this subject. She has in fact literally complied with the compact in its most rigid construction. For she adopted the very statute ofVirginia in the first instance, and literally gave her citizens the full benefit of twenty years to prosecute their suits, before she enacted the law now under consideration. As to the exceptions and provisoes, and savings in such statutes, they must necessarily be left, in all cases, to the wisdom or discretion of the legislative power. Ibid.
It is not to be questioned, that laws limiting the time of bringing suits constitute a part of the lex fori of every country ; the laws for administering justice, one of the most sacred and important of sovereign rights and duties, and a restriction upon which must materially affect both legislative and judicial independence. It can scarcely be supposed that Kentucky would have consented to accept a limited and crippled sovereignty ; nor is it doing justice to Virginia to believe that she would have wished to reduce Kentucky to a state of vassalage. Yet it would be difficult, if the literal and rigid construction necessary to exclude her from passing the limitation act were adopted, to assign her a position higher than that of a dependent on Virginia. Ibid.
The limitation act of the state of Kentucky, commonly known by the epithet of " the seven years law," does not violate the compact between the state ofVirginia and the state of Kentucky. Ibid.

ARTICLES SUPPLEMENTARY
To those concluded and signed, by the United States Commissioner, and. the Chickasaw delegation on the <HAth day of May, one thousand eight hundred and thirtyfour ; which being agreed to by the President and Senate of the United States, are to stand as part of said treaty.

Provision in favor of Levi Colbert, &c.
Ante, p. 381.
Children to be educated in the United States.

Art . I. It is represented that the old chiefs Levi Colbert and Isaac Alberson, who have rendered many and valuable services to their nation, desire on account of their health, to visit some watering place, during the present year, for recovery and restoration; it is agreed that there be paid to the agent for these purposes, and to discharge some debts which are due and owing from the nation, the sum of three thousand dollars, out of the appropriation of one thousand eight hundred and thirty-three, for carrying into effect the " treaty of Pontitock," which said sum so far as used is to be hereafter reimbursed to the nation, by said Levi Colbert and Isaac Alberson, and by the nation to the United States, as other advances are to be reimbursed, from the sale of their lands.
Art . II. The Chickasaw people express a desire that the Government shall at the expense of the United States, educate some of their children, and they urge the justice of their application, on the ground, that they have ever been faithful and friendly to the people of this country,-- that they have never raised the tomahawk, to shed the blood of an American, and have given up heretofore to their white brothers, extensive and valuable portions of their country, at a price wholly inconsiderable and inadequate; and from which the United States have derived great wealth and important advantages; therefore,with the advice and consent of the President and Senate of the United States, it is consented, that

TREATY WITH THE CHICKASAWS. 1834.

three thousand dollars for fifteen years, be appropriated and applied under the direction of the Secretary of War, for the education and instruction within the United States, of such children male and female or either, as the seven persons named in the treaty to which this is a supplement, and their successors, with the approval of the agent, from time to time may select and recommend.

Art . HI. The Chickasaw nation desire to close finally, all the busi-
ness they have on the east side of the Mississippi, that their Great Father, may be no more troubled with their complaints, and to this end, they ask the Government to receive from them a tract of land, of four miles square, heretofore reserved under the 4th article of their " Treaty of 1818," and to pay them within three months, from the date of this arrangement, the Government price of one dollar and a quarter per acre, for said reserve; and accordingly the same is agreed to, provided a satisfactory relinquishment of title from the parties interested, be filed with the Secretary of War, previous to said payment being m* ade.

A former reservation ceded to U. S.
Ante, p. 192.

Art . 4. Benj. Reynolds, agent at the time of paying their last annuity, had stolen from him by a negro slave of the Chickasaws, a box containing one thousand dollars; the chiefs of the Chickasaw people
satisfied of the fact, and hence unwilling to receive the lost amount from their agent, ask, and it is agreed, that the sum so stolen and lost, shall be passed to the credit of their nation by the United States, to be drawn on hereafter for their national purposes.

Money stolen from the agent.

Art . V. The Chickasaw people are aware that one clerk is insufficient to the bringing of their lands early into market; and rather than encounter the delay which must ensue, they prefer the increased expense of an additional one. It is therefore stipulated that the President shall appoint another clerk, at the same annual compensation, agreed upon by the " Treaty of Pontitock;" who shall be paid after the manner pre-
scribed therein. But whenever the President shall be of opinion that the services of any officer employed under this treaty, for the sale of
lands can be dispensed with; he will in justice to the Chickasaws, and to save them from unnecessary expenses, discontinue the whole, or such as can be dispensed with.

An additional clerk to be appointed.

ARTICLES OF CONVENTION AND AGREEMENT

May 24, 1834. Proclamation, July 1, 1834.

Proposed by the Commissioners on the part of the United States, in pursuance of the request made, by the Delegation representing the Chickasaw nation of Indians, and which have been agreed to.

Peace and friendship. Indians about to remove, are to be protected by U. S.
U. S. to prevent intrusions on their lands.

Art . I. It is agreed that perpetual amity, peace and friendship, shall exist between the United States, and the Chickasaw nation of Indians.
Art . II. The Chickasaws are about to abandon their homes, which they have long cherished and loved; and though hitherto unsuccessful, they still hope to find a country, adequate to the wants and support of their people, somewhere west of the Mississippi and within the territorial limits of the United States; should they do so, the Government of the United States, hereby consent to protect and defend them against the inroads of any other tribe of Indians, and from the whites; and agree to keep them without the limits of any State or Territory. The Chickasaws pledge themselves never to make war upon any Indian people, or upon the whites, unless they are so authorised by the United States. But if war be made upon them, they will be permitted to defend themselves, until assistance, be given to them by the United States, as shall be the case.
Art . HI. The Chickasaws are not acquainted with the laws of the whites, which are extended over them; and the many intruders which break into their country, interupting their rights and disturbing their repose, leave no alternative whereby restraint can be afforded, other than an appeal to the military force of the country, which they are unwilling to ask for, or see resorted to; and therefore they agree to forbear such a request, for prevention of this great evil, with the understanding, which is admitted, that the agent of the United States, upon

TREATY WITH THE CHICKASAWS. 1834.

451

the application of the chiefs of the nation, will resort to every legal civil remedy, (at the expense of the United States,) to prevent intrusions upon the ceded country; and to restrain and remove trespassers from any selected reservations, upon application of the owner of the same. And it is also agreed, that the United States, will continue some discreet person as agent, such as they now have, to whom they can look for redress of wrongs and injuries which may be attempted against them; and it is consented, that if any of their property, be taken by persons of the United States, covertly or forcibly, the agent on satisfactory and just complaint being made, shall pursue all lawful civil means, which the laws of the State permit, in which the wrong is done, to regain the same, or to obtain a just remuneration; and on failure or inability to procure redress, for the offended, against the offending party; payment for the loss sustained, on production of the record, and certificate of the facts, by the agent, shall be made by the United States; but in all such cases, satisfactory proof, for the establishing of the claim, shall be offered.
Art . IV. The Chickasaws desire to have within their own direction and control, the means of taking care of themselves. Many of their people are quite competent to manage their affairs, though some are not capable, and might be imposed upon by designing persons; it is therefore agreed that the reservations hereinafter admitted, shall not be permitted to be sold, leased, or disposed of unless it appear by the certificate of at least two of the following persons, to wit: Isb-ta-ho-ta-pa the King, Levi Colbert, George Colbert, Martin Colbert, Isaac Alberson, Henry Love, and Benj. Love, of which five have affixed their names to this treaty, that the party owning or claiming the same, is capable to manage, and to take care of his or her affairs; which fact, to the best of his knowledge and information, shall be certified by the agent; and furthermore that a fair consideration has been paid; and thereupon, the deed of conveyance shall be valid provided the President of the United States, or such other person as he may designate shall approve of the same, and endorse it on the deed; which said deed and approval, shall be registered, at the place, and within the time, required by the laws of the State, in which the land may be situated; otherwise to be void. And where such certificate is not obtained; upon the recommendation of a majority of the Delegation, and the approval of the agent, at the discretion of the President of the United States, the same may be sold; but the consideration thereof, shall remain as part of the general Chickasaw fund in the hands of the Government, until such time as the chiefs in council shall think it advisable to pay it to the claimant or to those, who may rightfully claim under said claimant, and shall so recommend it. And as the King, Levi Colbert, and the Delegation, who have signed this agreement, and to whom certain important and interesting duties purtaining to the nation, are assigned, may die, resign, or remove, so that their people may be without the benefit of their services, it is stipulated, that as often as any vacancy happens, by death, resignation, or otherwise, the chiefs shall select some discrete person of their nation to fill the occurring vacancy, who,upon a certificate of qualification, discretion and capability, by the agent, shall be appointed by the Secretary of War; whereupon, he shall possess all the authority granted to those who are here named, and the nation will make to the person so appointed, such reasonable compensation, as they with the assent of the agent and the Secretary of War, may think right, proper and reasonable to be allowed.
Art . V. It is agreed that the fourth article of the "Treaty of Pontitock," be so changed, that the following reservations be granted in fee: -- To heads of families, being Indians, or having Indian families,

Under what authority rese.r vations may be sold.
Grants to be in fee ; how determined.

Reservations for persons, not heads of families.
In case of marriage between a white man and an Indian woman.

consisting of ten persons, and upwards, four sections of land are reserved. To those'who have five and less than ten persons, three sections. Those who have less than five, two sections. Also those who own more than ten slaves, shall be entitled to one additional section; and those owning ten and less than ten to half a section. These reservations shall be confined, to the sections or fractional sections on which the party claiming lives, or to such as are contiguous or adjoining to the sections resided upon, subject to the following restrictions and conditions: --
Firstly. In cases where there are interferences arising, the oldest occupant or settler, shall have the preference, or,
Secondly. Where the land is adjudged unfit for cultivation, by the Agent, and three of the seven persons, named in the fourth article above, the party entitled, shall be, and is, hereby authorized, to locate his claim upon other lands, which may be unappropriated, and not subject to any other claim; and where two or more persons, insist upon the entry of the same unappropriated section or fractional section, the priority of right shall be determined by lot; and where a fractional section is taken, leaving a balance greater or less than the surveyed subdivision of a section, then the deficiency shall be made up, by connecting all the deficiencies so arising: and the Register and Receiver thereupon, shall locate full or fractional sections, fit for cultivation, in the names respectively of the different persons claiming which shall be held by them as tenants in common, according to the respective interests of those who are concerned; and the proceeds when sold by the parties claiming, shall be divided according to the interests, which each may have in said section or fractional section, so located, or the same may be divided agreeably to quality or quantity.
Art . VI. Also reservations of a section to each, shall be granted to persons male and female, not being heads of families, who are of the age of twenty-one years, and upwards, a list of whom, within a reason able time shall be made out by the seven persons herein before men tioned, and filed with the Agent, upon whose certificate of its believed accuracy, the Register and Receiver, shall cause said reservations to be located upon lands fit for cultivation, but not to interfere with the settlement rights of others. The persons thus entitled, are to be excluded from the estimated numbers contained in any family enumeration, as is provided for in the fifth article preceding: and as to the sale, lease, or disposition of their reserves, they are to be subject to the conditions and restrictions, set forth in the fourth article. In these and in all other reserves where the party owning or entitled, shall die, the interest in the same shall belong to his wife, or the wife and children, or to the husband, or to the husband and children, if there be any; and in cases of death, where there is neither husband, wife, nor children left, the same shall be disposed of for the general benefit; and the proceeds go into the general Chickasaw fund. But where the estate as is prescribed in this article, comes to the children, and having so come, either of them die, the survivor or survivors of them, shall be entitled to the same. But this rule shall not endure longer than for five years, nor beyond the period when the Chickasaws may leave their present
for a new home.
Art . VIL Where any white man, before the date hereof has married an Indian woman, the reservation he may be entitled to under this treaty, she being alive, shall be in her name, and no right of alienation of the same shall purtain to the husband unless he divest her of the title, after the mode and manner that feme coverts, usually divest themselves of title to real estate, that is,by the acknowledgment of the wife which may be taken before the Agent, and certified by him, that she

TREATY WITH THE CHICKASAWS. 1834.

453

consents to the sale freely, and without compulsion from her husband, who shall at the same time certify that the Head of such family is prudent, and competent to care of and manage his affairs; otherwise the proceeds of said sale shall be subject to the provisions and restrictions contained in the fourth article of this agreement. Rights to reservations as are herein, and in other articles of this agreement secured, will purtain to those who have heretofore intermarried with the Chickasaws, and are residents of the nation.

Art . VIII. Males and females below the age of twenty-one years, whose father being dead, the mother again has married, or who have neither father nor mother, shall each be entitled to half a section of land, but shall not be computed as parts of families under the fifth article, the same to be located under the direction of the Agent, and under the supervision of the Secretary of War, so as not to interfere with any settlement right. These lands may be sold upon a recommendation of a majority of the seven persons, heretofore named in this agreement, setting fortH that it will prove advantageous to the parties interested; subject however, to the approval of the President, or such other person as he shall designate. If sold, the funds arising shall be retained, in the possession of the Government, or if the President deem it advisable they shall be invested in stocks for the benefit of the parties interested, if tkere be a sufficient sum to be invested, (and it can be invested,) until said persons marry or come of age, when the amount shall be paid over to those who are entitled to receive it, provided a majority of the seven persons, with the Agent, shall certify, that in their opinion, it will be to their interest and advantage, then, and in that case, the proceeds shall be paid over to the party or parties entitled to receive them.
Art . IX. But, in running the sectional lines, in some cases it will happen, that the spring and the dwelling house, or the spring and the cleared land, or the cleared land and the dwelling house of settlers, may be separated by sectional lines, whereby manifest inconvenience and injury will be occasioned; it is agreed, that when any of these occurrences arise, the party shall be entitled as parts and portions of his reservations, to the adjoining section or fraction, as the case may be, unless there be some older occupant, claiming a preference; and in that event, the right of the party shall extend no farther than to give to the person, thus affected and injured, so much of his separated property, as will secure the spring; also, where a sectional line shall separate any improvement, dwelling house, kitchen or stable, so much of the section, which contains them, shall be added into the ocupied section, as will secure them to their original owner; and then and in that case, the older ocupant being deprived of preference, shall have his deficiency thus occasioned, made up to him by some fractional section, or after the mode pointed out in the latter part of the fifth article of this treaty.
Art . X. Reservations are admitted to the following persons, in addition to those which may be claimed under the fifth article of this Treaty to wit: -- Four sections to their beloved and faithful old Chief Levi Colbert; To George Colbert, Martin Colbert, Isaac Alberson, Henry Love and Benj. Love, in consideration of the trouble they have had in coming to Washington, and of the farther trouble hereafter to be encountered in taking care of the interests of their people, unaer the provisions of this treaty, one section of land to each. Also there is a fractional section, between the residence of George Colbert, and the Tennessee river, upon which he has a ferry, it is therefore consented, that said George Colbert, shall own and have so much of said

fraction, as may be contained in the following lines, to wit.--begining near Smith's ferry at the point where the base meridian line and the Tennessee river come in contact, -- thence south so far as to pass the dwelling-house, (and sixty yards beyond it,) within which is interred the body of his wife, -- thence east to the river and down the same to the point of begining. Also there shall be reserved to him an island, in said river, nearly opposite to this fraction, commonly called Colberts Island. A reservation also of two sections is admitted to Ish-ta-ho-ta-pa the King of the Chickasaw nation. And to Min-ta-ho-yea the mother of Charles Colbert one section of land. Also one section, each, to the following persons: -- Im-mub-bee, Ish-tim-o-Iut-ka, Ah-to-ho-woh, Pistah-lah-tubbe, Capt. Samuel Seley and William McGilvery. To Col. Benj. Reynolds their long tried and faithful Agent, who has guarded their interests and twice travelled with their people far west, beyond the Mississippi, to aid them in seeking and finding a home, there is granted two sections of land. Jointly to William Cooper and James Davis, lawyers of Mississippi who have been faithful to the Indians, in giving them professional advice, and legal assistance, and who are to continue to do so, within the States of Tennessee, Alabama and Mississippi, while the Chickasaw people remain in said States, one section is granted. To Mrs. Margt. Allen wife of the sub-agent in her own right, half a section. These reservations to Benj. Reynolds, William Cooper, James Davis and Margt. Allen, are to be located so as not to interfere with the Indian reservations.
Art . XL After the reservations are taken and located, which shall be the case as speedily as may be after the surveys are completed, of which the Register and Receiver shall give notice, the residue of the Chickasaw country shall be sold, as public lands of the United States are sold, with this difference; The lands as surveyed shall be offered at public sale at a price not less than one dollar and a quarter per acre; and thereafter for one year those which are unsold, and which shall have been previously offered at public sale, shall be liable to private entry and sale at that price; Thereafter, and for one year longer they shall be subject to entry and private sale, at one dollar per acre; Thereafter and during the third year, they shall be subject to sale and entry, at fifty cents per acre ; Thereafter, and during the fourth year, at twentyfive cents per acre; and afterwards at twelve and a half cents per acre. But as it may happen, in the fourth and after years, that the expenses may prove greater than the receipts, it is agreed, that at any time after the third year, the Chickasaws may declare the resedue of their lands abandoned to the United States, and if so, they shall be thenceforth acquitted of all and every expense on account of the sale of the same.
And that they may be advised of these matters it is stipulated, that the Government of the United States, within six months after any public sale takes place, shall advise them of the receipts and expenditures, and of balances in their favor; and also at regular intervals of six months, after the first report is made, will afford them information of the proceeds of all entries and sales. The funds thence resulting, after the necessary expenses of surveying and selling, and other advances which may be made, are repaid to the United States, shall from time to time be invested in some secure stocks, redeemable within a period of not more than twenty years; and the United States will cause the interest arising therefrom, annually to be paid to the Chickasaws.
Art . XII. When any portion of the country is fully surveyed, the President may order the same to be sold, but will allow six months, from the date of the first notice to the first sale; and three months' notice of any subsequent intended public sale, within which periods of

TREATY WITH THE CHICKASAWS. 1834.

455

time, those who can claim reservations, in the offered ranges of country, shall file their applications and entries with the Register and Receiver; that the name of the owner or claimant of the same, may be entered and marked on the general plat, at the office, whereby mistakes in the sales may be avoided, and injuries be prevented.

Art . XIII. If the Chickasaws shall be so fortunate as to procure a home, within the limits of the United States, it is agreed, that with the consent of the President and Senate so much of their invested stocks, as may be necessary to the purchase of a country for them to settle in, shall be permitted to them to be sold, or the United States will advance the necessary amount, upon a guarantee and pledge of an equal amount of their stocks; also, as much of them may be sold, with the consent of the President and Senate, as shall be adjudged necessary for establishing schools, mills, blacksmiths shops; and for the education of their children ; and for any other needful purpose, which their situation and condition, may make, and by the President and Senate be considered, necessary; and on the happening of such a contingency, and information thereof being given of an intention of the whole or any portion of the nation to remove; the United States will furnish competent persons, safely to conduct them to their future destination, and also supplies necessary to the same, and for one year after their arrival at the west, provided the Indians shall desire supplies, to be furnished for so long a period; the supplies so afforded, to be chargeable to the general Chickasaw account, provided the funds of said nation shall be found adequate to the expenses which under this and other articles of this agreement
may be required.

Provision for their removal.

Art . XIV. It is understood and agreed, that articles twelve and thirteen cff the " Treaty of Pontitock," of the twentieth day of October, one thousand, eight hundred and thirty-two, and which was concluded, with
Genl. John Coffee shall be retained; all the other articles of said treaty, inconsistent in any respect with the provisions of this, are declared to be revoked. Also so much of the supplemental treaty as relates to Colbert Moore; to the bond of James Colbert transferred to Robert Gordon; to the central position of the Land Office; to the establishment of mail routes through the Chickasaw country; and as it respects the privilege given to John Donely; be, and the same are declared to be in full force.

Art . XV; By the sixth article of a treaty made with the Chickasaw nation, by Andrew Jackson and Isaac Shelby, on the nineteenth day of October, one thousand eight hundred and eighteen, it was provided
that a Commissioner should be appointed, to mark the southern boundary of said cession; now it is agreed that the line which was run
and marked by the Commissioner on the part of the United States, in pursuance of said treaty, shall be considered the true line to the extent
that the rights and interests of the Chickasaws are conserned, and no
farther.

ARTICLES SUPPLEMENTARY
To those concluded and signed, by the United States Commissioner, and. the Chickasaw delegation on the <HAth day of May, one thousand eight hundred and thirtyfour ; which being agreed to by the President and Senate of the United States, are to stand as part of said treaty.

Provision in favor of Levi Colbert, &c.
Ante, p. 381.
Children to be educated in the United States.

Art . I. It is represented that the old chiefs Levi Colbert and Isaac Alberson, who have rendered many and valuable services to their nation, desire on account of their health, to visit some watering place, during the present year, for recovery and restoration; it is agreed that there be paid to the agent for these purposes, and to discharge some debts which are due and owing from the nation, the sum of three thousand dollars, out of the appropriation of one thousand eight hundred and thirty-three, for carrying into effect the " treaty of Pontitock," which said sum so far as used is to be hereafter reimbursed to the nation, by said Levi Colbert and Isaac Alberson, and by the nation to the United States, as other advances are to be reimbursed, from the sale of their lands.
Art . II. The Chickasaw people express a desire that the Government shall at the expense of the United States, educate some of their children, and they urge the justice of their application, on the ground, that they have ever been faithful and friendly to the people of this country,-- that they have never raised the tomahawk, to shed the blood of an American, and have given up heretofore to their white brothers, extensive and valuable portions of their country, at a price wholly inconsiderable and inadequate; and from which the United States have derived great wealth and important advantages; therefore,with the advice and consent of the President and Senate of the United States, it is consented, that
