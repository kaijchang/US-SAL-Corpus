tained shall be so construed as to authorize the said commissioners to adjudicate any claim which may be presented by a white man who may have had, or now has, an Indian wife or family; and any patent to land, which shall issue on any Indian claim, under the provisions of the treaty aforesaid, shall be issued to the Indian to whom the claim was allowed, if living, and if dead, to his or her heirs and legal representatives, any act of Congress, or usage, or custom, to the contrary notwithstanding.

Approv ed , August 23, 1842.

(a) The decisions of the courts of the United States on the subject of interest have been: The decree on bottomry is to consider the sum loaned and the premium as a principal, and to allow common interest on that sum for the delay of payment after it is due. The Ship Packet, 3 Mason's C. C. R. 255. An administrator is not liable to pay interest upon assets in his hands, unless under special circumstances. Neither is a partner, on partnership accounts before settlement, and a balance struck. Dexter v. Arnold, 3 Mason's C. C. R. 284. Interest will not be allowed against a trustee holding a fund where he had made no interest, if there be no laches or neglect or use of the money on his part. Cassels v.Vernon, 5 Mason's C. C. R. 332. Interest on money in the hands of the administrator, is not chargeable where the same is retained in his hands until a suit shall determine the right of the claimant thereto. Wade v. The Administrators of Wade, 1 Wash. C. C. R. 477. The court allowed the customary interest paid at Canton, on a note executed there. Cowqua v. Lauderbrun, 1 Wash. C. C. R. 521.
The correct general rule is to calculate interest up to the period when a payment is made, to satisfy which the payment should be first applied; and if it exceed the interest due, the balance is to be applied towards the payment of the principal; but if the payment is not sufficient to discharge the interest, the principal is not to be increased by adding to it the balance of interest due at the time, so as to produce interest on interest. Smith v. The Administrators of Shaw, 2 Wash. C. C. R. 167.

[Obsolete.]

Where the plaintiff has stated an account on a principle unfavorable to himself, as to the charge of
interest, he ought to be bound by it. Ibid. There is no difference as to the application of the general rule relative to calculating interest on debts
legally carrying interest, and on those debts where interest is given in the name of damages. Ibid. The rate of interest fixed by the law of Georgia, the contract having been made there, will be allowed
in the courts on such contracts, although it may exceed the interest allowed by the law of the State in which the court sits. Jaffray v. Dennis, 2 Wash. C. C. R. 253.
The defendant settled his account at the treasury department in 1808, on which a balance was stated against him. In 1812 he claimed further credits, which were allowed to him, and which reduced the balance chimed in 1808. The court instructed the jury to allow interest on the actual balance from 1808.
United States v. Ormsby, 3 Wash. C. C. R. 195. Where there have been running accounts between parties, and one party has been in the habit of trans-
mitting his accounts regularly to the other, striking a balance, and charging or giving credit for interest, as the balance might be, and no objections have been made to it, and where this mode of stating accounts is shown to be the custom of trade, such manner of charging interest is legal. Barclay v. Kennedy et al. 3 Wash. C. C. R. 350.
A usage to add interest to the annual account at the end of the year, and interest on the balance, does not apply in a case in which the commercial intercourse between the countries in which the parties respectively reside, had ceased when the account was transmitted; nor will it authorize the creditor to make other rests in the account. Denniston et al. v. Imbrie, 3 Wash. C. C. R. 396.
Where an alien enemy has an agent in the United States, and this is known to the debtor, interest ought not to abate during a war. Ibid.
A promise was made by the defendant, the drawer of a protested bill of exchange, that if the plaintiff would give time, he would pay the bill when he should be able. In an action on the new promise, the plaintiff is entitled only to the sum stated in the bill, and to interest from the time when defendant was able; and not to any damages. If the jury give more, the court will set aside the verdict, unless the plaintiff enter a remittitur for the overplus. Lonsdale v. Brown, 4 Wash. C, C. R. 148.
If there has not been a previous demand of the penalty of a bond, or an acknowledgment that the whole is due, interest is recoverable only from the commencement of the suit, on a bond with sureties given to the Bank of the United States for the faithful discharge of the duties of cashier of the branch bank at Middletown, Connecticut. United States Bank v. Magill et al., Paine's C. C. R. 661.
Interest is not allowed on unliquidated damages. Gilpins v. Consequa, Peters' C. C. R. 86. It is generally in the discretion of the jury to give interest in the name of damages. Willings et al. v. Consequa, Peters' C. C. R. 172. Damages for breach of contract do not bear interest. Youqua v. Nixon, Peters' C. C. R. 224. When an attachment is laid on money in the hands of a third person, interest ceases from the time of the attachment until it is dissolved; but where a debtor who is also a creditor lays an attachment in his own hands, interest is chargeable during the continuance of the attachment. Ibid. 303. It is the usage at Canton tp add interest to the other charges on the amount of the articles sold, and for which compensation is demanded. This will be allowed in the United States, on a Canton contract.
Ibid. Interest on debts due by the citizens of the United States to the subjects of the king of Great Britain,
ceased during the revolutionary war, and during the war of 1812; but the mere circumstance of w'ar existing between two countries is not a sufficient reason for abating interest on the debts due by the subjects ot one belligerent to the subjects of another. Conn et al. v. Penn et al. Peters1' C. C. R. 497.
A prohibition of all intercourse with an enemy during a war, furnishes a just reason for the abatement of interest on debts due to the subjects of the belligerent, until the return of peace. Ibid.
The rule as to the abatement of interest during the war, does not apply where the creditor, although a subject of the enemy, remains in the country of the debtor, or has a known agent residing there, and who is authorized to receive the debt. Ibid.
An account current, received and not objected to in a reasonable time, becomes a settled account bearing interest from the time it is stated, and the balance is payable on demand. Bainbridge & Co. v.Wilcocks, Baldwin's C. C. R. 538.
An account made up of principal and interest becomes one principal debt; the aggregate balance, where the account is thus settled, bearing interest. Ibid. 540.
Compound interest is not illegal, and may be recovered on an express promise, or one implied by law, as a part of the contract. Ibid. 541.
If an account contains a charge of interest during a war, it is recoverable if there is a promise to pay the amount after peace, or the account is in fact or law a settled account, from which a promise results by operation of law. Ibid. 542.
Whether the jury, in a case in which a man covenants to convey lands without fraud, and it afterwards appeared that, in truth, he had no title to the land, when he covenanted to convey, should allow interest on the value of the lands at the date of the contract, must depend on the circumstances of the case, of which they are the proper judges ; and it is competent to the defendant to give in evidence any circumstances tending to show interest should not be allowed. Letcher & Arnold v.Woodson, 1 Brockenb.
C.C. R. 212. The interest allowed on the personal estate, for the sums advanced by it to discharge the specialty
debts, should, in accordance both with the general course of the court, and with justice in particular cases, be limited to twenty years. Byrd v. Executors of Byrd, 2 Brockenb. C. C. R. 171.

the interest of the debt due, it seems that he should pay interest on the surplus rents and profits. Gordon v. Lewis, 2 Sumner's C. C. R. 143.
In the ordinary cases, where the relation of mortgagor and mortgagee is uncontroverted, if a mortgagee receive the rents of a mortgaged estate after his debt has been satisfied, and retain them to his own use, without paying them over to the mortgagor, he is chargeable with interest. Ibid.
If, however, there are sufficient equitable circumstances in favor of the mortgagee ; as if he retained the rents under a mistake, supposing the rights of the mortgagor extinguished; he would not be liable for interest until after notice of the adverse claim. Ibid.
Interest on the amount of the debt as ascertained by the decree of the circuit court, was allowed from the time of the judgment; but the damages allowed by the court were not permitted to bear interest. Jennings et al., Plaintiffs in Error, v. The Brig Perseverance, 3 Dall. 336; 1 Cond. Rep. 154.
Interest is to be calculated to the present time, upon the aggregate sum of principal and interest in the judgment below ; but not to the next term of the circuit court, when the mandate will operate, as the party has a right to pay the money immediately. Brown v. Van Braam, 3 Dall. 344 ; 1 Cond. Rep. 157.
Interest is, in general, allowed from the time a demand is made for the wages of a mariner; and if no special demand is made, then from the commencement of the suit. Gammell v. Skinner, 2 Gallis. C. C. R. 45.
If captured property is ordered to be sold, then no interest is allowed. Rose v. Himely, 4 Cranch, 291; 2 Cond. Rep. 98.
Interest commences on a pecuniary legacy at the expiration of one year from the decease of the testator, whatever may be the posture of the estate, unless some other period is specified in the will. The cases of infant children, not otherwise provided for, and of adopted children under age, are exceptions to the general rule. Sullivan v. Winthrop, 1 Sumner's C. C. R. 1.
Where the executors invested certain sums, less than the whole amount of the legacy, in the name of the legatee; held, that this was, pro tanto, a payment of the legacy; and that the interest accruing on those sums, within the year from the time of such investment, belonged to the legatee. Ibid.
Where the vendor is indebted to the vendee, and the sale is made in order to pay the debt, the vendor must pay interest from the time the debt is liquidated until he makes a good title ; and the vendee is accountable for the rents and profits from the time the contract is perfected, until it is specifically performed. Hepburn et al. v. Dunlop & Co., 1 Wheat. 179; 3 Cond. Rep. 529.
A party is as well entitled to interest on an appeal bond, as if he were to proceed on the judgment, if the judgment be on a contract for the payment cf money. He is entitled to interest from the rendition of the original judgment. Sneed et al. v. Wister et al. 8 Wheat. 690; 5 Cond. Rep. 556.
The taking of interest in advance upon the discount of a note in the usual course of business by a banker, is not usury. This has long been settled, and is not now open for controversy. Thornton v. The Bank of Washington, 3 Peters, 40.
The taking of interest for sixty-four days on a note is not usury, if the note given for sixty days, according to the custom and usage in the banks at Washington, was not due and payable until the sixty-fourth day. In the case of Renner v. The Bank of Columbia, 9 Wheat. 581, it was expressly held, that undet that custom the note was not due and payable before the sixty-fourth day ; for until that time the maker could not be in default. Ibid. 40.
Where it was the practice of the party, who had a sixty day note discounted at the bank of Washington, to renew the note by the discount of another note on the sixty-third day, the maker not being in fact bound to pay the note according to the custom prevailing in the District of Columbia; such a transaction on the part of the banker is not usurious, although on each note the discount for sixty-four days was deducted. Each note is considered as a distinct and substantive transaction. If no more than legal interest is taken upon the time the new note has to run, the actual application of the proceeds of the new note to the payment of the former note before it comes due, does not of itself make the transaction usurious. Something more must occur. There must be a contract between the bank and the party at the time of such discount, that the party shall not have the use and benefit of the proceeds until the former note becomes due, or that the bank shall have the use and benefit of them in the mean time. Ibid.
The contract to accept the bills of exchange on which the action was brought, was made in Charleston, South Carolina. The bills were drawn in Georgia on B. and H. in Charleston, with a view to their payment in Charleston, where the contract was to be executed. The interest on the bill which was so drawn and was unpaid, is to be charged at the rate of interest in South Carolina. Boyce & Henry v. Edwards, 4 Peters, 111.
Interest is not chargeable on money collected by the marshal of the District of Columbia for fines due to the levy court, the money having been actually expended by the marshal in repairs and improvements on the jail, under the opinions of the comptroller and auditor of the treasury department, that these expenditures were properly chargeable upon this fund, although those opinions may not be well founded. Levy Court of Washington v. Ringgold, 5 Peters, 451.
In an action brought on a note given for payment for teas, the defence was, that teas of an inferior quality were delivered; the jury must not credit the defendant with the amount of damages, as of the day the teas were delivered, but as of the day when the verdict was rendered. The interest on the note is to be reckoned to the day of the verdict, and from that amount is to be deducted the amount of the damages ascertained by the jury. Youqua v. Nixon et al. Peters' C. C. R. 229.
Assumpsit was brought for the proceeds of a cargo which was taken under legal process by the defendants, the consignees, in a foreign port, for the debts of the prior owners of the ship. Held, that the plaintiffs, the consignors, by bringing assumpsit, had waived the tort so that the customary commissions should be allowed the defendants ; but that the defendants were chargeable with interest from the receipt by them of the proceeds of the cargo. Ricketson v. Wright, 3 Sumner's C. C. R. 335.

In witness whereof, the said John Chambers, commissioner on the part of the United States, and the undersigned chiefs, braves, and headmen of the Sac and Fox nation of Indians, have hereunto set their hands, at the Sac and Fox agency, in the Territory of Iowa, this eleventh day of October, Anno Domini one thousand eight hundred and forty-two.

A TREATY

Aug. 9, 1842. Ratified Aug. 22, 1842.

To settle and define the boundaries between the territories of the United States and the possessions of Her Britannic Majesty in North America.;for thefinalsuppression ofthe African slave trade; andfor the giving up of criminals, fugitivefrom justice, in certain cases.

Preamble.

Wher eas certain portions of the line of boundary between the United States of America and the British dominions in North America, described in the second article of the treaty of peace of 1783, have not yet been ascertained and determined, notwithstanding the repeated attempts which have been heretofore made for that purpose: and whereas it is now thought to be for the interest of both parties, that, avoiding further discussion of their respective rights, arising in this respect under the said treaty, they should agree on a conventional line in said portions of the said boundary, such as may be convenient to both parties, with such equivalents and compensations as are deemed just and reasonable ' and whereas, by the treaty concluded at Ghent on the 24th day of December, 1814, between the United States and His Britannic Majesty, an article was agreed to and inserted of the following tenor, viz: "Art. 10. Whereas the traffic in slaves is irreconcilable with the principles of humanity and justice: and whereas both His Majesty and the United States are desirous of continuing their efforts to promote its entire abolition, it is hereby agreed that both the contracting parties shall use their best endeavors to accomplish so desirable an object:" and whereas, notwithstanding the laws which have at various times been passed by the two Governments, and the efforts made to suppress it, that criminal traffic is still prosecuted and carried on: and whereas the United States of America and Her Majesty the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland are determined that, so far as may be in their power, it shall be effectually abolished: and whereas it is found expedient, for the better administration of justice and the prevention of crime within the territories and jurisdiction of the two parties, respectively, that persons committing the crimes hereinafter enumerated, and being fugitives from justice, should, under certain circumstances, be reciprocally delivered up. The United States of America and Her Britannic Majesty, having resolved to treat on these several subjects, have for that purpose appointed their respective plenipotentiaries to negotiate and conclude a treaty, that is to say, the President of the United States has, on his part, furnished with full powers Daniel Webster, Secretary of State of the United States, and Her Majesty the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland has, on her part, appointed the Right Honorable Alexander Lord Ashburton, a peer of the said United Kingdom, a member of Her Majesty's most honorable Privy Council, and Her Majesty's Minister Plenipotentiary on a special mission to the United States, who, after a reciprocal communication of their respective full powers, have agreed to and signed the following articles:
(572)

TREATY WITH GREAT BRITAIN. 1842.

573

ARTICLE I.
It is hereby agreed and declared that the line of boundary shall be as follows: Beginning at the monument at the source of the river St. Croix as designated and agreed to by the commissioners under the fifth article of the treaty of 1794, between the Governments of the United States and Great Britain; thence, north, following the exploring line run and marked by the surveyors of the two Governments in the years 1817 and 1818, under the fifth article of the treaty of Ghent, to its intersection with the river St. John, and to the middle of the channel thereof; thence, up the middle of the main channel of the said river St. John, to the mouth of the river St. Francis; thence, up the middle of the channel of the said river St. Francis, and of the lakes through which it flows, to the outlet of the Lake Pohenagamook; thence, southwesterly, in a straight line, to a point on the northwest branch of the river St. John, which point shall be ten miles distant from the main branch of the St. John, in a straight line, and in the nearest direction --but if the said point shall be found to be less than seven miles from the nearest point of the summit or crest of the highlands that divide those rivers which empty themselves into the river St. Lawrence from those which fall into the river St. John, then the said point shall be made to recede down the said northwest branch of the river St. John, to a point seven miles in a straight line from the said summit or crest; thence, in a straight line, in a course about south, eight degrees west, to the point where the parallel of latitude of 46 25' north intersects the southwest branch of the St. John's; thence, southerly, by the said branch, to the source thereof in the highlands at the Metjarmette portage; thence, down along the said highlands which divide the waters which empty themselves into the river St. Lawrence from those which fall into the Atlantic ocean, to the head of Hall's stream; thence, down the middle of said stream, till the line thus run intersects the old line of boundary surveyed and marked by Valentine and Collins, previously to the year 1774, as the 45th degree of north latitude, and which has been known and understood to be the line of actual division between the States of New York and Vermont on one side, and the British province of Canada on the other; and, from said point of intersection, west, along the said dividing line, as heretofore known and understood,
to the Iroquois or St. Lawrence river.

Boundary line between U. S. and the British possessions.

ARTICLE II.
It is moreover agreed, that, from the place where the joint commissioners terminated their labors under the sixth article of the treaty of Ghent, to wit: at a point in the Neebish channel, near Muddy Lake, the line shall run into and along the ship channel between St. Joseph and St. Tammany islands, to the division of the channel at or near the head of St. Joseph's island; thence, turning eastwardly and northwardly around the lower end of St. George's or Sugar island, and following the middle of the channel which divides St. George's from St. Joseph's island; thence up the east Neebish channel, nearest to St. George's island, through the middle of Lake George; thence, west of Jonas' island, into St. Mary's river, to a point in the middle of that river, about one mile above St. George's or Sugar island, so as to appropriate and assign the said island to the United States ; thence, adopting the line traced on the maps by the commissioners, through the river St.
Mary and Lake Superior, to a point north of He Royale, in said lake, one hundred yards to the north and east of He Chapeau, which lastmentioned island lies near the northeastern point of lie Royale, where the line marked by the commissioners terminates; and from the last mentioned point, southwesterly, through the middle of the sound between

574

TREATY WITH GREAT BRITAIN. 1842.

lie Royale and the northwestern main land, to the mouth of Pigeon river, and up the said river, to and through the north and south Fowl Lakes, to the lakes of the height of land between Lake Superior and the Lake of the Woods; thence, along the water communication to Lake Saisaginaga, and through that lake; thence, to and through Cypress Lake, Lac du Bois Blanc, Lac la Croix, Little Vermilion Lake, and Lake Namecan, and through the several smaller lakes, straits, or streams, connecting the lakes here mentioned, to that point in Lac la Pluie, or Rainy Lake, at the Chaudiere Falls, from which the commissioners traced the line to the most northwestern point of the Lake of the Woods; thence, along the said line, to the said most northwestern point, being in latitude 49 23' 55" north, and in longitude 95 14' 38" west from the observatory at Greenwich; thence, according to existing treaties, due south to its intersection with the 49th parallel of north latitude, and along that parallel to the Rocky mountains. It being understood that all the water communications and all the usual portages along the line from .Lake Superior to the Lake of the Woods, and also Grand portage, from the shore of Lake Superior to the Pigeon river, as now actually used, shall be free and open to the use of the citizens and subjects of both countries.

Navigation of the river St. John to be free to both parties.
Proviso.

ARTICLE III.
In order to promote the interests and encourage the industry of all the inhabitants of the countries watered by the river St. John and its tributaries, whether living within the State of Maine or the province of New Brunswick, it is agreed that, where, by the provisions of the present treaty, the river St. John is declared to be the line of boundary, the navigation of the said river shall be free and open to both parties, and shall in no way be obstructed by either; that all the produce of the forest, in logs, lumber, timber, boards, staves, or shingles, or of agriculture, not being manufactured, grown on any of those parts of the State of Maine watered by the river St. John, or by its tributaries, of which fact reasonable evidence shall, if required, be produced, shall have free access into and through the said river and its said tributaries, having their source within the State of Maine, to and from the seaport at the mouth of the said river St. John's, and to and round the falls of the said river, either by boats, rafts, or other conveyance; that when within the province of New Brunswick, the said produce shall be dealt with as if it were the produce of the said province; that, in like manner, the inhabitants of the territory of the upper St. John, determined by this treaty to belong to Her Britannic Majesty, shall have free access to and through the river, for their produce, in those parts where the said river runs wholly through the State of Maine: Provided, always, That this agreement shall give no right to either party to interfere with any regulations not inconsistent with the terms of this treaty which the Governments, respectively, of Maine or of New Brunswick may make respecting the navigation of the said river, where both banks thereof shall belong to the same party.

Grants of land, &c. within the territory, confirmed to the persons in possession of such grants.

ARTICLE IV. All grants of land heretofore made by either party, within the limits of the territory which by this treaty falls within the dominions of the other party, shall be held valid, ratified, and confirmed to the persons in possession under such grants, to the same extent as if such territory had by this treaty fallen within the dominions of the party by whom such grants were made; and all equitable possessory claims, arising from a possession and improvement, of any lot or parcel of land, by the person actually in possession, or by those under whom such person claims, for more than six years before the date of this treaty, shall, in <

TREATY WITH GREAT BRITAIN. 1842.

575

like manner, be deemed valid, and be confirmed and quieted by a release to the person entitled thereto, of the title to such lot or parcel of land, so described as best to include the improvements made thereon; and in all other respects the two contracting parties agree to deal upon the most liberal principles of equity with the settlers actually dwelling upon the territory falling to them, respectively, which has heretofore been in dispute between them.
ARTICLE V.

Whereas, in the course of the controversy respecting the disputed territory on the Northeastern boundary, some moneys have been received by the authorities of Her Britannic Majesty's province of New Brunswick, with the intention of preventing depredations on the forests of the said territory, which moneys were to be carried to a fund called the "disputed territory fund," the proceeds. whereof, it was agreed, should be hereafter paid over to the parties interested, in the proportions to be determined by a final settlement of boundaries: It is hereby agreed, that a correct account of all receipts and payments on the said fund shall be delivered to the Government of the United States, within six months after the ratification of this treaty; and the proportion of the amount due thereon to the States of Maine and Massachusetts, and any bonds or securities appertaining thereto, shall be paid and delivered over to the Government of the United States; and the Government of the United States agrees to receive for the use of, and pay over to, the States of Maine and Massachusetts, their respective portions of said fund; and further to pay and satisfy said States, respectively, for all claims for expenses incurred by them in protecting the said heretofore disputed territory, and making a survey thereof, in 1838; the Government of the United States agreeing, with the States of Maine and Massachusetts, to pay them the further sum of three hundred thousand dollars, in equal moieties, on account of their assent to the line of boundary described in this treaty, and in consideration of the conditions and equivalents received therefor, from the Government of Her Britannic Majesty.
ARTICLE VI.
It is furthermore understood and agreed, that for the purpose of running and tracing those parts of the line between the source of the St. Croix and the St. Lawrence river which will require to be run and ascertained, and for marking the residue of said line by proper monuments on the land, two commissioners shah be appointed, one by the President of the United States, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate thereof, and one by Her Britannic Majesty: and the said commissioners shall meet at Bangor, in the State of Maine, on the first day of May next, or as soon thereafter as may be, and shall proceed to mark the line above described, from the source of the St. Croix to the river St. John; and shall trace, on proper maps, the dividing line along said river, and along the river St. Francis, to the outlet of the Lake Pohenagamook; and, from the outlet of the said lake, they shall ascertain, fix, and mark, by proper and durable monuments on the land, the line described in the first article of this treaty; and the said commissioners shall make to each of their respective Governments a joint report or declaration, under their hands and seals, designating such line of boundary, and shall accompany such report or declaration with maps, certified by them to be true maps of the new boundary.

Distribution of the " disputed territory fund." Commissioners to be appointed to mark the line between the St. Croix and St. Lawrence rivers.

ARTICLE VII. It is further agreed, that the channels in the river St. Lawrence,on Certain waters both sides of the Long Sault islands, and of Barnhart island; the chan- open to both nels in the river Detroit, on both sides of the island Bois Blanc, and parties.

576

TREATY WITH GREAT BRITAIN. 1842.

between that island and both the American and Canadian shores; and all the several channels and passages between the various islands lying near the junction of the river St. Clair with the lake of that name, shall be equally free and open to the ships, vessels, and boats of both parties.

Mutual agreement for the suppression of the slave trade. Parties to unite in remonstrances with other powers within whose dominions a market is found for slaves.

ARTICLE VIII.
The parties mutually stipulate that each shall prepare, equip, and maintain in service, on the coast of Africa, a sufficient and adequate squadron, or naval force of vessels, of suitable numbers and descriptions, to carry in all not less than eighty guns, to enforce, separately and respectively, the laws, rights, and obligations, of each of the two countries, for the suppression of the slave trade; the said squadrons to be independent of each other; but the two Governments stipulating, nevertheless, to give such orders to the officers commanding their respective forces as shall enable them most effectually to act in concert and co-operation, upon mutual consultation, as exigencies may arise, for the attainment of the true object of this article; copies of all such orders to be communicated by each Government to the other, respectively.
ARTICLE IX.
Whereas, notwithstanding all efforts which may be made on the coast of Africa for suppressing the slave trade, the facilities for carrying on that traffic, and avoiding the vigilance of cruisers, by the fraudulent use of flags and other means, are so great, and the temptations for pursuing it, while a market can be found for slaves, so strong, as that the desired result may be long delayed, unless all markets be shut against the purchase of African negroes; the parties to this treaty agree that they will unite in all becoming representations and remonstrances, with any and all Powers within whose dominions such markets are allowed to exist; and that they will urge upon all such Powers the propriety and duty of closing such markets effectually, at once and forever.

Criminals to be delivered up to either party, upon requisition, &c.

ARTICLE X.
It is agreed that the United States and Her Britannic Majesty shall, upon mutual requisitions by them, or their ministers, officers, or authorities, respectively made, deliver up to justice all persons who, being charged with the crime of murder, or assault with intent to commit murder, or piracy, or arson, or robbery, or forgery, or the utterance of forged paper, committed within the jurisdiction of either, shall seek an asylum, or shall be found, within the territories of the other: provided that this shall only be done upon such evidence of criminality as, according to the laws of the place where the fugitive or person so charged shall be found, would justify his apprehension and commitment for trial, if the crime or offence had there been committed: and the respective judges and other magistrates of the two Governments shall have power, jurisdiction, and authority, upon complaint made under oath, to issue a warrant for the apprehension of the fugitive or person so charged, that he may be brought before such judges or other magistrates, respectively, to the end that the evidence of criminality may be heard and considered; and if, on such hearing, the evidence be deemed sufficient to sustain the charge, it shall be the duty of the examining judge or magistrate to certify the same to the proper Executive authority, that a warrant may issue for the surrender of such fugitive. The expense of such apprehension and delivery shall be borne and defrayed by the party who makes the requisition, and receives the fugitive.
