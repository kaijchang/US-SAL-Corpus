It is the desire of the Australian Government that, in accordance

formalities of the copyright laws of the United States of America be extended for the benefit of citizens of Australia whose works are eligible to copyright in the United States.

EMBASSY OF THE United STATES OF AMERICA
Guatemala, December 20, 1949.

EXCELLENCY :

I have the honor to refer to the Embassy's Note no . 128 of Septem-

ber 20 , 1949 [ ] and the Ministry's Note no . 17843 of November 22 , 1949 , [2 ] with regard to the inactivation of the United States Air Force

base at Guatemala City and the desirability of effecting an exchange of notes between the Government of the United States and the Govern-

ment of Guatemala to enable the free movement of the military aircraft

of each country into and through the airspace of the other country . The principal use by the United States of such an arrangement would be to facilitate the flight of United States military aircraft between the continental United States and the Panama Canal Zone.

I have the honor to advise Your Excellency that my Government

agrees that the following arrangements be formalized by this exchange of notes :

Right of military air transit and technical
stop.

(I) Definition : The right of military air transit and technical stop is the right to operate military aircraft into , over and away from the

sovereign territory of a nation and to land at one or more specified

airfields or seaplane landing areas therein only to refuel , effect

repairs and/or avoid unfavorable weather conditions. Military

aircraft of the United States are aircraft of the Air Force, Army,

Navy, Marine Corps , and Coast Guard . Military aircraft of Guatemala are aircraft of the Air Force and Army.
(II) The Government of the United States of America grants to the military aircraft of the Government of Guatemala the right of air transit and technical stop as defined in (I) above over the following routes , subject to the regulations and provisions set forth herein :

power. Landing and parking fees at airfields under jurisdiction of

military service will be waived in all instances. Notification pro-

cedures will follow current practice of filing a standard flight plan

with the nearest control center or foreign clearing station . (IV) The use of airfields under this arrangement will normally

be restricted to non-scheduled landing by single aircraft or small groups of planes . Whenever an airfield is to be used for scheduled

hours advance notice will be given . Customs charges ,

ized to transport military personnel and cargo and government

Governments becoming directly involved in hostilities, each Govern-

ment reserves the right to terminate this agreement forthwith or to reconsider the extent of its adherence thereto . These arrangements

are concluded without prejudice to the possible inclusion of these rights in a multilateral military air transit agreement at a later date.

GUATEMALA, 20 de diciembre de 1949.

Tengo el honor de referirme a la atenta nota de Vuestra Señoría, número 165 , fechada el día de hoy , en la cual , refiriéndose a negociaciones anteriores relativas a la conveniencia de que los Gobiernos de Guatemala y de los Estados Unidos concluyan un arreglo para regular el libre tránsito de aeronaves militares en los territorios respectivos de ambos países , Vuestra Señoría se sirve manifestarme la anuencia de su ilustrado Gobierno para que se formalice el arreglo mediante el presente cambio de notas.

Me es muy grato informar a Vuestra Señoría que mi Gobierno está enteramente de acuerdo con el referido arreglo , en los siguientes términos :

(I) (II) (III) (IV)

Definición: El derecho de tránsito aéreo militar y parada técnica es el derecho de operar aviones militares hacia el interior, sobre y hacia el exterior del territorio soberano de una nación y aterrizar en uno o más aeródromos o sitios de acuatizaje especificados, únicamente con fines de abastecimiento de combustible , efectuar reparaciones o evitar condiciones desfavorables del tiempo . Los aviones militares de los Estados Unidos son aviones de la fuerza aérea
del ejército , marina, cuerpo de marina y guardacostas. Los aviones militares de Guatemala son aviones de la Fuerza Aérea y del Ejército .
El Gobierno de los Estados Unidos concede a los aviones militares del Gobierno de Guatemala el derecho de tránsito aéreo y parada técnica como queda definido en el párrafo (I) , en las siguientes rutas sujetos a los reglamentos y disposiciones aquí estipuladas : Miami , Florida ; Bronwsville , Texas; o Nueva Orleans , Louisiana , por la vía más directa en ruta aérea a Washington, D. C. , y Nueva York, Nueva York .

Se conviene en que el derecho a tránsito aéreo y parada técnica incluye privilegios recíprocos de vuelo y aterrizaje para aviones militares de cada uno de los dos gobiernos a través de sus territorios y en campos de aterrizaje bajo el control del otro gobierno . Este derecho no se extiende a bases que se encuentren en el territorio soberano de una tercera potencia. En todos los casos se renuncia a los derechos de aterrizaje y estacionamiento en los aeródromos que estén bajo jurisdicción militar. El procedimiento de avisos se ajustará a la práctica ordinaria de presentar un plan corriente de vuelo en el centro de control o estación extranjera de distribución más cercana.
El uso de campos de aterrizaje de conformidad con este arreglo será restringido normalmente a aterrizajes imprevistos de aviones solos o pequeños grupos de aeroplanos . Siempre que haya de usarse un aeródromo para tránsito programado o se espere gran afluencia de tránsito , se harán arreglos administrativos entre los dos Gobiernos . En los campos aéreos en que sea dudoso lo adecuado de las instalaciones de tierra, donde se necesiten acondicionamientos extraordinarios, o siempre que vayan a bordo personas que requieran recepción especial u honores, se dará aviso con veinticuatro horas de anticipación .

(V) (VI)

Los pasajeros militares y la tripulación de cada gobierno que operen de conformidad con los derechos concedidos en el párrafo (II ) , estarán exentos de derechos de aduana y restricciones y derechos de inmigración aplicables según las leyes y reglamentos vigentes del otro gobierno , pero no estarán exentos de la inspección aduanera, de inmigración , policía y salubridad requeridas por las leyes del otro gobierno . Queda convenido que al hacer uso del derecho contenido en el presente , cada servicio militar tendrá permiso de obtener y transportar por contrato o comprar abiertamente las provisiones necesarias para su personal y nave aérea mientras se encuentre en el territorio del otro . Tales compras
gozarán de las mismas exenciones de impuestos de que gozan las fuerzas militares del país de soberanía.

las leyes y reglamentos aplicables incluyendo las que se refieren a las reservas de espacio aéreo y a las reglas de tránsito aéreo contenidas en la parte 60 del reglamento de Aviación Civil . A normas de la misma naturaleza vi-

gentes en Guatemala estarán sujetas las naves aéreas militares del Gobierno de los Estados Unidos , cuando entren o vuelen sobre el espacio aéreo de la República de Guatemala .

Este cambio de notas derogará el permiso abierto de emergencia otorgado a los Estados Unidos el 16 de diciembre de 1941 por el Gobierno de Guatemala y el permiso abierto por seis meses extendido al Gobierno de Guatemala por los Estados Unidos el 22 de julio de 1949.
Estos privilegios se consideran renovables automáticamente cada año , a menos que una de las partes dé aviso con seis meses de anticipación de su deseo de dar por terminado este arreglo . En el caso de que cualquiera de los dos Gobiernos se viera envuelto directamente en hostilidades, cada uno de ellos se reserva el derecho de dar por terminado este acuerdo inmediatamente o reconsiderar el alcance de
su adhesión al mismo . Estos arreglos se concluyen sin perjuicio de

GENERAL NOTES

I. The word " aforo" , according to Uruguayan customs legislation , signifies the official valuation of merchandise , on which the ad valorem rate of duty is assessed .
The " aforos" which are presently in force are included in this Schedule , so as to facilitate , in respect of each product which is subject to this method , the assessment of the actual amount of duty to be levied ,
II.- The Uruguayan Government declares that it will refrain from raising the " aforos" which appear in this Schedule , until January 1, 1951.
It also gives notice of its intention of modifying " its method of determining dutiable value " , in accordance with the contents of Article II ( paragraph 3) and of Article VII of the General Agreement . III. The significance of the abbreviations contained in this Schedule , is the following : (a) K (Kilo ) : the weight of the product without container . (b) K.I.C.

514011 SEÑOR EMBAJADOR :

MÉXICO, D. F. , 7 de octubre de 1949.

Tengo el honor de referirme al Convenio Básico , celebrado en julio de 1943 entre el entonces Departamento de Salubridad Pública de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos y el "Institute of Inter-American Affairs", modificado posteriormente y que estableció el actual Programa Cooperativo de Salubridad y Saneamiento en México. También me refiero a la nota número 3463 del Honorable Señor Leslie A. Wheeler, Encargado de Negocios ad - interim , de fecha 22 de julio último, referente a la nueva prórroga de dicho Convenio que desea el Gobierno de México .
Me es grato tomar nota de que el Gobierno de Vuestra Excelencia está de acuerdo con el de México en que una prórroga del programa arriba mencionado más allá de la fecha actual de su terminación del 30 de junio de 1949 , sería deseable, en vista de los mutuos beneficios que ambos gobiernos están recibiendo de dicho programa . Consecuentemente me es grato manifestar a Vuestra Excelencia que el Gobierno de México está dispuesto a que se hagan los arreglos necesarios para que se prorrogue el Convenio entre la Secretaría de Salubridad y Asistencia de México y el "Institute of Inter-American Affairs" por un período adicional de un año , es decir, a partir del 30 de junio de 1949 hasta el 30 de julio [ ¹ ] de 1950.
Quedaría entendido que, durante este período de prórroga , el Instituto haría una contribución de Dlls. 100,000.00, moneda de los Estados Unidos de América , a la Dirección de Cooperación Interamericana de Salubridad Pública, para ser usada en llevar a cabo las proyectadas actividades del programa, y el Gobierno de México, por conducto de la Secretaría de Salubridad y Asistencia , haría una contribución a la Dirección citada, para el mismo propósito, de Dlls .

1 Should read "junio." In the United States reply note, no. 3796 , Oct. 14, 1949 , post, p. 1101 , and in the extension agreement signed at México Oct. 27, 1949 ( not printed ) , the date is given as June 30, 1950.

300,000.00, moneda de los Estados Unidos de América, o su equivalente en pesos moneda nacional mexicana. Queda entendido que el Instituto proporcionaría también, durante el mismo período de prórroga, fondos que serían administrados por el Instituto mismo, y no depositados en la cuenta de la Dirección de Cooperación Interamericana, para el pago de salarios y otros gastos de los miembros del personal de campo (field staff) de la División de Salubridad y Saneamiento que son sostenidos por el Instituto en México. Las cantidades a que se hace referencia serían adicionales a las cantidades que ya bajo el actual Convenio Básico, en su forma modificada, se requiere que contribuyan y proporcionen las Partes en la prosecución del programa.
El Gobierno de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos considerará la presente nota y la nota de respuesta de la Embajada de los Estados Unidos de América, comunicando su conformidad , como constitutivas de un acuerdo entre los dos gobiernos que entrará en vigor en la fecha en que se suscriba un Convenio entre el Secretario de Salubridad y Asistencia de México y un Representante del "Institute of Inter- American Affairs ", que incorpore los detalles técnicos arriba mencionados.
Aprovecho esta oportunidad para renovar a Vuestra Excelencia las seguridades de mi más alta y distinguida consideración .

I take pleasure in noting that Your Excellency's Government agrees with that of Mexico that an extension of the said program beyond its present date of termination on June 30, 1949 , would be desirable in

Therefore, I take pleasure in informing Your Excellency that the Government of Mexico is ready to have the necessary arrangements made for the extension of the program between the Secretary of Public Health and Welfare of Mexico and

It is understood that the Institute will also make available, during the same extension period, funds to be administered by the Institute and not deposited to the account of the Dirección de Cooperación Interamericana, for payment of salaries and other expenses of the members of the Health and Sanitation Division Field Staff who are maintained by the Institute in Mexico. The amounts referred to will be in addition to the sums already required under the present Basic Agreement , as amended, to be contributed and made available by the Parties in furtherance of the program.
The Government of the United Mexican States will consider this
note and the reply thereto from the Embassy of the United States of America, transmitting its assent, as constituting an agreement between our two Governments which shall come into force on the date of signature of an agreement by the Secretary of Public Health and Welfare of Mexico and a representative of the "Institute of InterAmerican Affairs", [ 2 ] embodying the aforesaid operational details .
