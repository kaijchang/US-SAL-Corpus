Regulation of commercial intercourse.

ARTICLE IV. More especially each party shall have a right to carry their own produce, manufactures and merchandize, in their own or any other vessels to any parts of the dominions of the other, where it shall be lawful for all the subjects or citizens of that other freely to purchase them; and thence to take the produce, manufactures and merchandize of the other, which all the said citizens or subjects shall in like manner be free to sell them, paying in both cases such duties, charges and fees only, as are or shall be paid by the most favoured nation. Nevertheless the King of Prussia and the United States, and each of them, reserve to themselves the right, where any nation restrains the transportation of merchandize to the vessels of the country of which it is the growth or manufacture, to establish against such nations retaliating regulations; and also the right to prohibit, in their respective countries, the importation and exportation of all merchandize whatsoever, when reasons of state shall require it. In this case, the subjects or citizens of either of the contracting parties shall not import nor export the merchandize prohibited by the other; but if one of the contracting parties permits any other nation to import or export the same merchandize, the citizens or subjects of the other shall immediately enjoy the same liberty.

En ce cas, les sujets ou citoyens d'une des parties contractantes ne pourront importer ni exporter les marchandises prohibees par 1'autre. Mais si 1'une des parties contractantes permet a. quelqu'autre nation d'importer ou d'exporter ces memes marchandises, les citoyens ou sujets de 1'autre partie contractante jouiront tout aussitot d'une liberte pareille.
ARTICLE V. Les marchands, commandans de vaisseaux, et autres sujets ou citoyens de chacune des deux nations, ne seront pas forces dans les ports ou dans la jurisdiction de 1'autre, de decharger aucune sorte de marchandises dans d'autres vaisseaux, ni de les recevoir a bord de leurs propres navires, ni d'attendre leur chargement plus long-temps qu'il ne leur plaira.

Et en general il ne se fera point de recherche a bord du vaisseau, a moins qu'on n'y ait charge clandestinement et illegalement des marchandises prohibees. Dans ce cas, celui par 1'ordre duquel elles ont ete portees a bord, ou celui qui les y a portees sans ordre, sera soumis aux loix du pays ou il se trouve, sans que le reste de 1'equipage soit moleste, ni les autres marchandises, ou le vaisseau saisis ou detenus par cette raison.

Les vaisseaux des sujets ou citoyens d'une des deux parties contractantes, arrivant sur une cote appartenante a, 1'autre, mais n'ayant pas dessein d'entrer an port, ou y etant entres, ne desirant pas de decharger leurs cargaisons, ou de rompre leur charge, auront la liberte de repartir et de poursuivre leur route sans empechement, et sans etre obliges de rendre compte de leur cargaison, ni de payer aucuns impots, charges et droits quelconques, excepte ceux etablis sur les vaisseaux une fois entres dans le port, et destines a 1'entretien du port meme ou a d'autres etablissemens qui ont pour but la surete et la commodite des navigateurs, lesquels droits, charges et impots seront les memes et se payeront sur le meme pied qu'ils sont acquittes par les sujets ou citoyens de 1'etat ou ils sont etablis.

ARTICLE IX. Au cas que quelque vaisseau appartenant a 1'une des deux parties contractantes auroit fait naufrage, echoue ou souffert quelque autre dommage sur les cotes ou sous la domination de 1'autre, les sujets ou citoyens respectifs recevront, tant pour eux que pour eurs vaisseaux et effets, la meme assistance qui auroit ete fournie aux habitans du pays ou 1'accident arrive; et ils payeront seulement les memes charges et droits, auxquels les dits habitants auroient ete assujettis en pareil cas.

Liberty of conscience secured.

ARTICLE XI.
The most perfect freedom of conscience and of worship, is granted to the citizens or subjects of either party, within the jurisdiction of the other, without being liable to molestation in that respect, for any cause other than an insult on the religion of others. Moreover, when the subjects or citizens of the one party, shall die within the jurisdiction of the other, their bodies shall be buried in the usual burying grounds, or other decent and suitable places, and shall be protected from violation or disturbance.

Liberty for either party to trade with a nation at war with the other. Free ships make free goods.

ARTICLE XII. If one of the contracting parties should be engaged in war with any other power, the free intercourse and commerce of the subjects or citizens of the party remaining neuter with the belligerent powers, shall not be interrupted. On the contrary, in that case as in full peace, the vessels of the neutral party may navigate freely to and from the ports and on the coasts of the belligerent parties, free vessels making free goods, insomuch, that all things shall be adjudged free which shall be on board any vessel belonging to the neutral party, although such things belong to an enemy of the other; and the same freedom shall be extended to persons who shall be on board a free vessel, although they should be enemies to the other party, unless they be soldiers in actual service of such enemy.

No goods shall be deemed contraband, so as to justify confiscation ; but vessels may be detained.

ARTICLE XIII. And in the same case of one of the contracting parties being engaged in war with any other power, to prevent all the difficulties and misunderstandings that usually arise respecting the merchandize heretofore called contraband, such as arms, ammunition and military stores of every kind, no such articles carried in the vessels, or by the subjects or citizens of one of the parties to the enemies of the other, shall be deemed contraband, so as to induce confiscation or condemnation and a loss of property to individuals. Nevertheless, it shall be lawful to stop such vessels and articles, and to detain them for such length of time as the captors may think necessary to prevent the inconvenience or damage that might ensue from their proceeding, paying however a reasonable compensation for the loss such arrest shall occasion to the proprietors : And it shall further be allowed to use in the service of the captors, the whole or any part of the military stores so detained, paying the owners the full value of the same, to be ascertained by the current price at. the place of its destination. But in the case supposed, of a vessel stopped for articles heretofore deemed contraband, if the master of the vessel stopped will deliver out the goods supposed to be of contraband nature, he shall be admitted to do it, and the vessel shall not in that case be carried into any port, nor further detained, but shall be allowed to proceed on her voyage.

Vessels to be furnished with sea-letters or passports.

ARTICLE XIV.

ARTICLE XI. Il sera accorde la plus parfaite liberte de conscience et de culte aux citoyens et sujets de chaque partie contractante dans les etats de 1'autre, et personne ne sera moleste a, cet egard pour quelque cause que ce soit, · si ce n'est pour insulte faite a la religion de 1'autre. De plus, si des sujets et citoyens de I'une des parties contractantes venoient a mourir dans la jurisdiction de 1'autre, leurs corps seront enterres dans les endroits ou 1'on a coutume de faire les enterremens, ou dans tel autre lieu decent et convenable, et ils seront proteges contre toute violence et trouble.
ARTICLE XII. Si I'une des parties contractantes etoit en guerre avec une autre puissance, la libre correspondance et le commerce des citoyens ou sujets de la partie qui demeure neutre envers les puissances belligerantes, ne seront point interrompus. Au contraire, et dans ce cas, comme en pleine paix, les vaisseaux de la partie neutre pourront naviguer en toute surete dans les ports et sur les cotes des puissances belligerantes, les vaisseaux libres rendant les marchandises libres, en tant qu'on regardera comme libre tout ce qui sera a bord d'un navire appartenant a la partie neutre, quand meme ces effets appartiendroient a 1'ennemi de 1'autre. La meme liberte s'etendra aux personnes qui se trouveront a bord d'un vaisseau libre, quand memes elles seroient ennemis de 1'autre partie, excepte que ce fussent des gens de guerre, actuellement au service de 1'ennemi.
ARTICLE XIII. Dans le cas ou I'une des parties contractantes se trouveroit en guerre avec une autre puissance, il a ete convenu que pour prevenir les difficultes et les discussions qui surviennent ordinairement par rapport aux marchandises ci-devant appellees de contrebande, telles que armes, munitions, et autres provisions de guerre de toute espece, aucun de ces articles, charges a bord des vaisseaux des citoyens ou sujets de I'une des parties, et destines pour 1'ennemi de 1'autre, ne sera cense de contrebande, au point d'impliquer confiscation ou condamnation, et d'entrainer la perte de la propriete des individus. Neanmoins il sera permis d'arreter ces sortes de vaisseaux et effets, et de les retenir pendant tout le temps que le preneur croira necessaire pour prevenir les inconveniens et le dommage qui pourroient en resulter autrement; mais dans ce cas on accordera une compensation raisonable pour les pertes qui auront ete occasionnees par la saisie. Et il sera permis en outre aux preneurs d'employer a leur service, en tout, ou en partie, les munitions militaires detenues, en en payant aux proprietaires la pleine valeur, a determiner sur le prix qui aura cours a 1'endroit de leur destination; mais que dans le cas enonce, d'un vaisseau arrete pour des articles ci-devant appelles contrebande, si le maitre du navire consentoit a delivrer les marchandises suspectes, il aura la liberte de le faire, et le navire ne sera plus amene dans le port, ni detenu plus long-temps, mais aura toute liberte de poursuivre sa route.
ARTICLE XIV.
Dans le cas ou I'une des deux parties contractantes se trouveroit engagee dans une guerre avec une autre puissance, et afin que les vaisseaux de la partie neutre soyent promptement et surement reconnus, on est convenu qu'ils devront etre munis de lettres de mer ou passeports, exprimant le nom, le proprietaire, et le port du navire, ainsi que le nom et la demeure du maitre. Ces,passeports, qui seront expedies en bonne et due forme (a determiner par des conventions entre les parties, lorsque 1'occasion le requerra) devront etre renouvelles toutes les fois que le

be exhibited whensoever required, as well in the open sea as in port. But if the said vessel be under convoy of one or more vessels of war, belonging to the neutral party, the simple declaration of the officer commanding the convoy, that the said vessel belongs to the party of which he is, shall be considered as establishing the fact, and shall relieve both parties from the trouble of further examination.

ARTICLE XV. And to prevent entirely all disorder and violence in such cases, it is stipulated, that when the vessels of the neutral party, sailing without convoy, shall be met by any vessel of war, public or private, of the other party, such vessel of war shall not approach within cannon shot of the said neutral vessel, nor send more than two or three men in their boat on board the same, to examine her sea-letters or passports. And all persons belonging to any vessel of war, public or private, who shall molest or injure, in any manner whatever, the people, vessels or effects of the other party, shall be responsible in their persons and property for damages and interest, sufficient security for which shall be given by all commanders of private armed vessels before they are commissioned.

dans le port de 1'autre partie, mais elles pourront en sortir librement, et etre conduites en tout temps par le vaisseau preneur aux endroits portes par les commissions, dont 1'officier commandant le dit vaisseau sera oblige de faire montre. Mais tout vaisseau qui aura fait des prises sur les sujets de S. M. T. C. le Roi de France, ne sauroit obtenir un droit d'asile dans les ports ou havres des Etats Unis; et s'il etoit force d'y entrer par des tempetes ou dangers de mer, il sera oblige d'en repartir le plutot possible, conformement a la teneur des traites subsistants entre S. M. T. C. et les Etats Unis.
ARTICLE XX.

Dans le cas qu'un navire est repris par un vaisseau de guerre de I'une des puissances contractantes, il sera rendu au proprietaire, moyennant qu'il paye un trentieme du navire et de la cargaison, si le batiment n'a pas ete plus de 24 heures au pouvoir de 1'ennemi, et le dixieme de cette valeur, s'il y a ete plus long-temps, lesquelles sommes seront distributes en guise de gratification a ceux qui 1'auront repris. 3. Dans ces cas la restitution n'aura lieu qu'apres les preuves faites de lapropriete, sous caution de la quotepart qui en revient a celui qui a repris le navire. 4. Les vaisseaux de guerre publics et particuliers des deux parties contractantes seront admis reciproquement avec leur prises dans les ports respectifs; cependant ces prises ne pourront y etre dechargees ni vendues, qu'apres que la legitimite de la prise aura ete decidee suivant les loix et regiemens de 1'etat dont le preneur est sujet, mais par la justice du lieu ou la prise aura ete conduite. 5.

Tous les vaisseaux marchands et commercans, employes a 1'echange des productions de differens endroits, et par consequent destines a faciliter et repandre les necessites, les commodites et les douceurs de la vie, passeront librement et sans etre molestes. Et les deux puissances contractantes s'engagent a n'accorder aucune commission a des vaisseaux armes en course, qui les autorisat a prendre ou a detruire ces sortes de vaisseaux marchands, ou a interrompre le commerce.

pourroient faire 1'une sur 1'autre ne seront transposes ni aux Indes

qui leur seront fixes, et qu'on leur accordera des logemens commodes;

que les simples soldats seront distribues dans des cantonnemens ouverts,

assez vastes pour prendre 1'air et 1'excercice, et qu'ils seront loges dans

des barraques aussi spatieuses et aussi commodes que le sont celles des

troupes de la puissance au pouvoir delaquelle se trouvent les prisoniers.

Que cette puissance fera pourvoir journellement les officiers d'autant

de rations, composees des memes articles et de la meme qualite, dont

jouissent en nature ou en equivalent, les officiers du meme rang qui

sont a son propre service; qu'elle fournira egalement a tous les autres

prisoniers une ration pareille a celle qui est accordee au soldat de sa

propre armee. Le montant de ces depenses sera paye par 1'autre puis-

sance, d'apres une liquidation de compte a arreter reciproquement pour

1'entretien des prisonniers a la fin de la guerre; et ces comptes ne

seront point confondus ou balances avec d'autres comptes, ni la solde

qui en est due, retenue comme compensation ou represailles, pour tel

autre article ou telle autre pretention reelle ou supposee. Il sera permis

a chacune des deux puissances d'entretenir un commissaire de leur

choix, dans chaque cantonnement des prisonniers qui sont au pouvoir de

1'autre; ces commissaires auront la liberte de visiter les prisoniers, aussi

souvent qu'ils le desireront; ils pourront egalement recevoir et distribuer

les douceurs que les parens ou amis des prisoniers leur feront parvenir.

Enfin il leur sera fibre encore de faire leurs rapports par lettres ouvertes,

a ceux qui les employent; mais si un officier manquoit a sa parole
