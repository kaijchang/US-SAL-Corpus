United States be, and he is hereby authorized to appoint, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, three discreet and disinterested citizens of the United States, to lay out a road from Cumberland, or a point on the northern bank of the river Potomac in the state of Maryland, between Cumberland and the place where the main road leading from Gwinn's to Winchester, in Virginia, crosses the river, to the state of Ohio: whose duty it shall be, as soon as may be, after their appointment, to repair to Cumberland aforesaid, and view the ground, from the
points on the river Potomac herein before designated, to the river Ohio; and to lay out in such direction as they shall judge, under all circumstances, the most proper, a road from thence to the river Ohio, to strike
the same at the most convenient place, between a point on its eastern bank, opposite to the northern boundary of Steubenville, in said state of Ohio, and the mouth of Grave creek, which empties into the said river, a little below Wheeling, in Virginia.
Sec . 2. And be it further enacted, That the aforesaid road shall be laid out four rods in width, and designated on each side by a plain and distinguishable mark on a tree, or by the erection of a stake or monument, sufficiently conspicuous, in every quarter of a mile of the distance, at least, where the road pursues a straight course so far or farther, and on each side, at every point where an angle occurs in its course.
Sec . 3. And be it further enacted, That the commissioners shall, as soon as may be, after they have laid out said road, as aforesaid, present to the President an accurate plan of the same, with its several courses and distances, accompanied by a written report of their proceedings, describing the marks and monuments by which the road is designated, and the face of the country over which it passes, and pointing out the particular parts, which they shall judge require the most and immediate attention and amelioration; and the probable expense of making the same passable in the most difficult parts, and through the whole distance : designating the state or states, through which said road has been laid out, and the length of the several parts which are laid out on new ground, as well as the length of those parts laid out on the road now travelled. Which report the President is hereby authorized to accept or reject, in the whole, or in part.

Sec . 5. And be it further enacted, That said commissioners shall each receive four dollars per day, while employed as aforesaid, in full for their compensation, including all expenses. And they are hereby authorized to employ one surveyor, two chainmen, and one marker, for whose faithfulness and accuracy, they, the said commissioners, shall be responsible, to attend them in laying out said road, who shall receive in full satisfaction for their wages, including all expenses, the surveyor three dollars per day, and each chainman and the marker, one dollar per day, while

He it enacted by the Senate and House ofRepresentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the bond heretofore

(a) By the 27th section of the act of September 24, 1789, chap. 20, vol. i. 87, the appointment of a marshal in each district, is provided for, and his duties and powers regulated.
The decisions of the courts of the United States as to the duties, powers, and liabilities of Marshals are:--
The marshal may have an attachment to enforce the payment of his fees of office, against suitors in the court; so also against the endorser on the writ, who by the lex loci, is liable to respond for costs. Anonymous, 2 Gallis. C. C. R. 101.
The marshal is entitled to his full commissions according to the act of 1799, chap. 19, upon all interlocutory sales.of prize property. The act of 27th January, 1813, applies only to sales after final condemnation. The Avery, 2 Gallis. C. C. R. 308.
It is the duty of the marshal, upon all interlocutory sales, to bring the proceeds into court, with a regular account of the sales. Ibid.
The marshal is entitled to commissions upon prize property, removed from his district, by consent of parties, and there sold. The San Jose Indiana, 2 Gallis. C. C. R. 311.
After a rule on the marshal to return the capias ad satisfaciendum issued against the defendants, on the return of the marshal that the plaintiff had directed him not to serve the writ on one defendant, and that the other could not be found, the court have nothing more to do with the rule. If the marshal has misconducted himself, the remedy is an action for a false return. Segourney v. Ingraham et al., 2 Wash. C. C. R. 336.
Where an individual, acting in pursuance of what he conceives a just claim to property, proceeds by legal process to enforce it, and causes a levy to be made on property which is claimed by another, without abusing or perverting its true object, there is and ought to be a very different rule for damages, from the case in which vindictive damages may be allowed, if after a due course of legal investigation, his case is not well founded. Where the defendant had acted as the marshal of the United States, in the execution of his duties as a public officer, and had made a levy, but had done nothing out of the strictest line of duty, the circuit court instructed the jury to allow compensation for the injury sustained, and nothing more. Pacific Ins. Co. v. Conard, Baldwin's C. C. R. 143.
It has long been settled that a jury ought not in any case to find exemplary damages against a public officer, acting in obedience to orders from the government, without any circumstances of aggravation, if he violates the law in making a seizure of property. Ibid.
A marshal is not removed by the appointment of a new one, until he receives notice of such appointment ; all acts done by the old marshal after the appointment of a new one, before notice, are good ; but his acts subsequent to notice are void. Wallace's C. C. R. 119.
If a debtor, committed to the state jail under process from the courts of the United States, escape, the marshal is not liable. Randolph v. Donaldson, 9 Cranch, 76; 3 Cond. Rep. 280.
The act of Congress has limited the responsibility of the marshal to his own acts and the acts of his deputies. The keeper of a state jail is, neither in fact nor in law, the deputy of the marshal; he is not appointed by, nor removable at the will of the marshal. When a prisoner is regularly committed to a state jail by the marshal, he is no longer in the custody of the marshal, or controllable by him. Ibid.
If a marshal, before the date of his official bond, receive, upon an execution, money due to the United States, with orders from the comptroller to pay it into the Bank of the United States, which he neglects to do, the sureties in his official bond, executed afterwards, are not liable therefor upon the bond ; although the money remain in the marshal's hands after the execution of the bond. The United States v. Giles and others, 9 Cranch, 212; 3 Cond. Rep. 377.
Qweri/. Whether the sureties in a marshal's bond conditioned for the faithful execution of his duty, " during his continuance in the said office," are liable for money received by him after his removal from office, upon an execution which remained in his hands at the time of such removal ? Ibid.
The comptroller of the treasury has a right to direct the marshal to whom he shall pay money received upon executions, and a payment according to such directions is good ; and it seems he may avail himself of it upon the trial without having submitted it as a claim to the accounting officers of the treasury. Ibid.
It is the duty of the marshal of a court of the United States, to execute all process which may be placed in his hands ; but he performs this duty at his peril, and under the guidance of law. He must, of course, exercise some judgment in the performance. Should he fail to obey the exigit of the writ without a legal excuse, or should he in its letter violate the rights of others, he is liable to the action of the injured party. Life and Fire Ins. Co. of New York v. Adams, 9 Peters, 573.
The marshal makes distribution of proceeds of prize sales in his hands, at his peril; and on his mispayment a libel lies against him. For safety the marshal should obtain the order of the court, which ought not to be made without previous measures guarding against fraud, and providing for latent claims, Keene etal. v. The Gloucester, 2 Dallas, 36.

given, or which may hereafter be given by the marshal of any district, for the faithful performance of the duties of his office, shall be filed and recorded in the office of the clerk of the district court or circuit court, sitting within the district for which such marshal shall have been appointed, and copies thereof, certified by the clerk, under the seal of the said court, shall be competent evidence in any court of justice.
Sec . 2. And be it further enacted, That it shall be lawful, in case of the breach of the condition of any such bond, for any person, persons, or body politic, thereby injured, to institute a suit upon such bond, in the name and for the sole use of such party, and thereupon to recover

filed in the office of the clerk of the court, &c.
Suits may be instituted on the breach of the condition of the bond, &c.

The marshal is bound to serve a subpoena in chancery as soon as he reasonably can; and he will, in case of neglect, be answerable to the complainant, who may have sustained a loss in consequence of his neglect. Kennedy v. Brent, 6 Cranch, 187; 2 Cond. Rep. 345.
The court will not dictate to the marshal what return he shall make to process in his hands ; he must return it at his peril; and any person injured by it, may have his legal remedy for the return. Wortman v. Conyngham, Peters' C. C. R. 241.
The return of the marshal to a writ, cannot be traversed in an action between the parties to the suit in which the writ issued. Wilson v. The Executor of Hurst, Peters' C. C. R. 441.
An officer of the United States, who has levied a sum of money on an execution in favour of the United States, to whom the United States are indebted for fees of office in a sum greater than the amount of the execution, has a right to retain it by way of set-off; and on a motion made on the part of the United States to commit the officer for failure to pay over the money so levied, he will be permitted to show that the United States are indebted to him: and if this be shown, it is sufficient cause why he should not be attached. United States v. Mann, 2 Brockenb. C. C. R. 9.
A marshal is liable upon his official bond, for the failure of his deputy to serve original process; but the measure of his liability is the extent of the injury received by the plaintiff, produced by such negligence. If the loss of the debt be the direct legal consequence of the failure to serve the process, the amount of the debt is the measure of damage; but the mere failure to execute the process, does not, in itself, necessarily infer the loss of the debt to the plaintiff, by the negligence of the officer, because the plaintiff might sue out other process, on the failure of the officer to execute the first process. The question, whether the loss of the debt was or was not the direct legal consequence of the negligence of the officer, is a question of fact, depending on circumstances, of which the jury must judge. United States v. Moore's Administrators, 2 Brockenb. C. C. R. 317.
Where a writ of capias ad respondendum, comes to the hands of a deputy marshal, who arrests the debtor, and the debtor thereupon pays to the deputy the amount of the debt for which he was sued, and the officer discharges the debtor from custody, and returns the writ, "debt and costs satisfied," this is not an official act which binds his principal. The deputy marshal is a mere ministerial officer, and he has no right to adjust the debt, and make himself responsible to the plaintiff. He is bound to pursue the mandate of the writ, and that requires him to arrest the debtor, and take bail. The discharge of the debtor from custody, without taking bail, is indeed a misfeasance in office, for which his principal, the marshal, is responsible; but he is only responsible for the injury done to the plaintiff. The return of the deputy, shows that no bail was taken ; and if by taking out other process, the plaintiff could have secured his debt, which is a fact to be determined by the jury; the loss of the debt to the plaintiff, is not the necessary legal consequence of the conduct of the deputy, and no injury, in a legal sense, is done to the plaintiff thereby. Ibid.
Where a decree directs an officer of the court to sell property, " and bring the proceeds of sale into court," and the sale is on a credit of one, two, and three years, and bonds are given for the payment of the instalments, these bonds are the immediate proceeds of sale. As a matter of convenience, they may be permitted to remain in the hands of the officer; but as matter of strict right, the creditor may require that they shall be brought into court. Wallis v. Thornton's Administrators et al. 2 Brockenb C. C. R. 422.
Where bonds are made payable to the marshal of a court, he has a right to collect them. In such case, the marshal must be considered as a trustee for the creditor. Query. Whether the direction to take bond implies, that it shall be taken to the marshal, rather than to the creditor? Where bonds are taken, not to the marshal and his successors, but to J. P., marshal, &c., his executors, administrators, and assigns, could his successor, in the event of the marshal being changed before the money is paid, act on these bonds without an assignment ? Ibid.
By the 69th section of the collection act of 1799, ch. 22, the goods or merchandise seized under that act, are to be put into custody of the collector, or such other persons as he may appoint for that purpose, no longer than until the proper proceedings are instituted under the 89th section of the same act, to ascertain whether they are forfeited or not; and as soon as the marshal seizes the goods under the proper process of the court, the marshal is entitled to the sole and exclusive custody thereof, subject to the future orders of the court. Ex parte Jesse Hoyt, Collector of the Port of New York, 13 Peters, 279.
By the statute of Indiana, the marshal on a replevy bond is required to take one or more sufficient freehold securities, and if freehold securitv be not taken, the marshal is liable. Bispham v. Taylor, 2 M`Lean's C. C. R. 355.
If the sureties be not freeholders, however ample at the time they may have been considered, the marshal is liable. In this respect the statute must be pursued. Ibid.
To examine the county records, is not an unreasonable duty on the marshal. Ibid. Where the marshal takes insufficient bail for the appearance of a defendant, he is only answerable for the actual injury sustained by the plaintiff. In such a case the insolvency of the defendant may be shown in mitigation of damages. Ibid. But where a judgment is replevied, good freehold security must be taken for the payment of the judgment. If insufficient security be taken, the marshal is liable. Ibid.

Cha p. XXV.--An Act to provide for persons who were disabled by known
wounds received in the Revolutionary war.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That any commissioned or non-commissioned officer, musician, soldier, marine or seaman, disabled in the actual service of the United States, while in the line of his duty, by known wounds received during the revolutionary war, and who did not desert the service ; or who, in consequence of disability as aforesaid, resigned his commission or took a discharge; or who, after incurring disability as aforesaid, was taken captive by the enemy, and remained either in captivity or on parole, until the close of said revolutionary war; or who, in consequence of known wounds received as aforesaid, has at any period since, become and continued disabled in such manner as to render him unable to procure a subsistence by manual labour; whether such officer, musician, soldier, marine or seaman, served as a volunteer, in any proper service against the common enemy, or belonged to a detachment of the militia, which served against the common enemy, or to the regular forces of the United States, or of any particular state, he shall, upon substantiating his claim, in the manner herein after described, be placed on the pension list of the United States, during life, or the continuance of such disability, and be entitled, under the regulations herein after mentioned, to receive such sum as shall be found just and proper, by the testimony adduced.
Sec . 2. And be it further enacted, That in substantiating such claim, the following rules and regulations shall be complied with, that is to say: All evidence shall be taken on oath or affirmation, before the judge of the district, or one of the judges of the territory in which such claimant resides, or before some person specially authorized by commission from said judge.
Decisive disability, the effect of a known wound or wounds, received while in the actual service and line of duty against the common enemy, during the revolutionary war, must be proved by the affidavit of the commanding officer of the regiment, corps, company, ship, vessel, or craft, in which such claimant served ; or of two other credible witnesses to the same effect, setting forth the time when, and place where, such known wound or wounds were received ; and particularly describing the same.
The nature of such disability, and in what degree it prevents the claimant from obtaining his subsistence, must be proved by the affidavit of some reputable physician or surgeon, stating his opinion either from his own knowledge and acquaintance with the claimant, or from an examination of such claimant on oath or affirmation; which when necessary for that purpose, shall be administered to said claimant by said judge or commissioner. And the said physician or surgeon, in his affidavit, shall particularly describe the wound or wounds from whence the disability appears to be derived.
Every claimant must prove, by at least one credible witness, that he continued in service during the whole time for which he was detached, or for which he engaged, unless he was discharged, or left the service in consequence of some derangement of the army, or in consequence of his disability resigned his commission; or was after his disability in captivity or on parole, until the close of the revolutionary war. And in the same manner must prove his mode of life and employment since he left the service, and the place or places where he has since resided, and his place of residence, at the time of taking such testimony.
Every claimant shall, by his affidavit, give satisfactory reasons why he did not make application for a pension before, and that he is not on the pension list of any state; and the judge or commissioner shall certify in writing, his opinion of the credibility of the witnesses, whose affidavits

NINTH CONGRESS. Ses s . I. Ch . 25- 1806.

377

he shall take, in all those cases, where by this act it is said the proof

shall be made by a credible witness or witnesses. And also, that the

examining physician or surgeon is reputable in his profession.

Sec . 3. And be it further enacted, That the said judge of the dis-

trict, or person by him commissioned as aforesaid, shall transmit a list

of such claims, accompanied by the evidence, affidavits, certificates, and

proceedings had thereon in pursuance of this act, noting particularly the

day on which the testimony was closed before him, to the secretary for

the department of war, that the same may be compared with muster

rolls, or other documents in his office: and the said secretary shall make

a statement of all such cases, which, together with all the testimony, he

shall from time to time transmit to Congress, with such remarks as he

may think proper, that Congress may be enabled to place such claimants

on the pension list as shall be found entitled to the privilege. And it

shall be the duty of the judge, or commissioner aforesaid, to permit each

claimant to take a transcript of the evidence and proceedings had

respecting his claim, if he shall desire it, and to certify the same to be

correct.

Sec . 4. And be it further enacted, That every pension, or increase

thereof, by virtue of this act, shall commence on the day when the

claimant shall have completed his testimony, before the authority proper

to take the same.

Sec . 5. And be it further enacted, That an increase of pension may

be allowed to persons, already placed upon the pension list of the United

States, for disabilities caused by known wounds received during the

revolutionary war, in all cases where justice shall require the same:

Provided, that the increase, when added to the pension formerly received,

shall in no case exceed a full pension.

Every invalid making application for this purpose, shall be examined

by two reputable physicians or surgeons, to be authorized by commis-

sion from the judge of the district, where such invalid resides; who

shah report in writing, on oath or affirmation, their opinion of the nature

of the applicant's disability, and in what degree it prevents him from

obtaining a subsistence by manual labour, which report shall be trans-

mitted by said physicians or surgeons, to the secretary for the department

of war; who shall compare the same with the documents in his office,

and shall make a statement of all such cases, which, together with the

original report, he shall from time to time transmit to Congress, with

such remarks as he may think proper, that they may be enabled to do

justice to such pensioners.

Sec . 6. And be it further enacted, That a full pension given by this

act to a commissioned officer, shall be one half of the monthly pay

legally allowed, at the time of incurring said disability, to his grade in

the forces raised by the United States; and the proportions, less than a

full pension, shall be the correspondent proportions of said half pay;

and a full pension to a non-commissioned officer, musician, soldier,

marine, or seaman, shall be five dollars a month, and the proportions

less than a full pension, shall be the like proportions of five dollars a

month; but no pension of a commissioned officer shall be calculated at

a higher rate than the half pay of a lieutenant colonel.

Sec . 7. And be it further enacted, That the pensions, or increase

thereof, which may be allowed by this act, shall be paid in the same

manner as pensions to invalids, who have been heretofore placed on the

pension list, are now paid, and under such restrictions and regulations,

in all respects, as are prescribed by law.

Sec . 8. And be it further enacted, That from and after the passage

of this act, no sale, transfer, or mortgage of the whole or any part of the

pension, payable to any non-commissioned officer, musician, soldier,

marine, or seaman, before the same becomes due, shall be valid. And

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That for the purpose of defining the limits of the vacant and unappropriated lands in the state of Tennessee, hereafter to be subject to the sole and entire disposition of the United States, the following line be, and hereby is established, to wit: beginning at the place where the eastern or main branch of Elk river shall intersect the southern boundary line of the state of Tennes-
see : from thence running due north, until said line shall intersect the northern or main branch of Duck river; thence down the waters of Duck river, to the military boundary line, as established by the seventh section of an act of the state of North Carolina, intituled "An act for the relief of the officers and soldiers of the continental line, and for other purposes;" (passed in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty-three) thence with the military boundary line, west to the place
where it intersects the Tennessee river; thence down the waters of the river Tennessee, to the place where the same intersects the northern boundary line of the state of Tennessee.

(a) The state of North Carolina, by her act of cession of the western lands, of 1789, recited in the act of Congress of April 2, 1790, chap. 6, vol. i. page 106, accepting that cession, and by her act of 1803, chap. 3, ceding to Tennessee the right to issue grants, has parted with her right to issue grants for lands within the state of Tennessee, upon entries made before the cession. Burton's lessee v. Williams, et al., 3 Wheat. 529; 4 Cond. Rep. 315.
Under the cession act, ratified by the act of Congress, the United States held the domain of the vacant lands in Tennessee, subject to the right which North Carolina retained, of perfecting the inchoate titles created under her laws. Ibid.
But it seems that the holder of such a grant must resort to the equity jurisdiction of the United States for relief. Ibid.
After the cession of land by North Carolina to the United States, the former had no right to grant those lands to any grantee who had not an incipient title before the cession. Polk's lessee v. Wendall, 9 Cranch, 87 ; 3 Cond. Rep. 286.

April 18, 1806.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That for the purpose of defining the limits of the vacant and unappropriated lands in the state of Tennessee, hereafter to be subject to the sole and entire disposition of the United States, the following line be, and hereby is established, to wit: beginning at the place where the eastern or main branch of Elk river shall intersect the southern boundary line of the state of Tennes-
see : from thence running due north, until said line shall intersect the northern or main branch of Duck river; thence down the waters of Duck river, to the military boundary line, as established by the seventh section of an act of the state of North Carolina, intituled "An act for the relief of the officers and soldiers of the continental line, and for other purposes;" (passed in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty-three) thence with the military boundary line, west to the place
where it intersects the Tennessee river; thence down the waters of the river Tennessee, to the place where the same intersects the northern boundary line of the state of Tennessee.

A line established for defining the limits of the vacant lands of the U. S. in Tennessee.
Courses thereof.

(a) The state of North Carolina, by her act of cession of the western lands, of 1789, recited in the act of Congress of April 2, 1790, chap. 6, vol. i. page 106, accepting that cession, and by her act of 1803, chap. 3, ceding to Tennessee the right to issue grants, has parted with her right to issue grants for lands within the state of Tennessee, upon entries made before the cession. Burton's lessee v. Williams, et al., 3 Wheat. 529; 4 Cond. Rep. 315.
Under the cession act, ratified by the act of Congress, the United States held the domain of the vacant lands in Tennessee, subject to the right which North Carolina retained, of perfecting the inchoate titles created under her laws. Ibid.
But it seems that the holder of such a grant must resort to the equity jurisdiction of the United States for relief. Ibid.
After the cession of land by North Carolina to the United States, the former had no right to grant those lands to any grantee who had not an incipient title before the cession. Polk's lessee v. Wendall, 9 Cranch, 87 ; 3 Cond. Rep. 286.

Chap . XXXI.--An Act to authorize the state of Tennessee to issue grants and perfect titles to certain lands therein described, and to settle the claims to the vacant and unappropriated lands within the same. (a)

April 18, 1806.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That for the purpose of defining the limits of the vacant and unappropriated lands in the state of Tennessee, hereafter to be subject to the sole and entire disposition of the United States, the following line be, and hereby is established, to wit: beginning at the place where the eastern or main branch of Elk river shall intersect the southern boundary line of the state of Tennes-
see : from thence running due north, until said line shall intersect the northern or main branch of Duck river; thence down the waters of Duck river, to the military boundary line, as established by the seventh section of an act of the state of North Carolina, intituled "An act for the relief of the officers and soldiers of the continental line, and for other purposes;" (passed in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty-three) thence with the military boundary line, west to the place
where it intersects the Tennessee river; thence down the waters of the river Tennessee, to the place where the same intersects the northern boundary line of the state of Tennessee.

A line established for defining the limits of the vacant lands of the U. S. in Tennessee.
Courses thereof.

(a) The state of North Carolina, by her act of cession of the western lands, of 1789, recited in the act of Congress of April 2, 1790, chap. 6, vol. i. page 106, accepting that cession, and by her act of 1803, chap. 3, ceding to Tennessee the right to issue grants, has parted with her right to issue grants for lands within the state of Tennessee, upon entries made before the cession. Burton's lessee v. Williams, et al., 3 Wheat. 529; 4 Cond. Rep. 315.
Under the cession act, ratified by the act of Congress, the United States held the domain of the vacant lands in Tennessee, subject to the right which North Carolina retained, of perfecting the inchoate titles created under her laws. Ibid.
But it seems that the holder of such a grant must resort to the equity jurisdiction of the United States for relief. Ibid.
After the cession of land by North Carolina to the United States, the former had no right to grant those lands to any grantee who had not an incipient title before the cession. Polk's lessee v. Wendall, 9 Cranch, 87 ; 3 Cond. Rep. 286.

order a court of inquiry to examine into the nature of any transaction, accusation, or imputation against any officer or soldier, the said court shall consist of one or more officers, not exceeding three, and a judge advocate, or other suitable person as a recorder, to reduce the proceedings and evidence to writing, all of whom shall be sworn to the faithful performance of their duty. This court shall have the same power to
summon witnesses as a court martial, and to examine them on oath. But they shall not give their opinion on the merits of the case, excepting they shall be thereto specially required. The parties accused shall also be permitted to cross examine and interrogate the witnesses, so as to in-
vestigate fully the circumstances in the question. Article 92. The proceedings of a court of inquiry must be authenti-
cated by the signature of the recorder and the president, and delivered to the commanding officer: and the said proceedings may be admitted as evidence by a court martial, in cases not capital, or extending to the dismission of an officer, provided that the circumstances are such, that oral testimony cannot be obtained. But as courts of inquiry may be perverted to dishonourable purposes, and may be considered as engines of destruction to military merit, in the hands of weak and envious commandants, they are hereby prohibited, unless directed by the President
of the United States, or demanded by the accused. Article 93. The judge advocate, or recorder, shall administer to the
members the following oath : "You shall well and truly examine and inquire, according to your
evidence, into the matter now before you, without partiality, favour, affection, prejudice, or hope of reward. So help you God."
After which the president shall administer to the judge advocate, or recorder, the following oath :
"You A. B. do swear that you will, according to your best abilities, accurately and impartially record the proceedings of the court, and the evidence to be given in the case in hearing. So help you God."
The witnesses shall take the same oath as witnesses sworn before a court martial.
Article 94. When any commissioned officer shall die or be killed in the service of the United States, the major of the regiment, or the officer doing the major's duty in his absence, or in any post or garrison, the

(a) By the 27th section of the act of September 24, 1789, chap. 20, vol. i. 87, the appointment of a marshal in each district, is provided for, and his duties and powers regulated.
The decisions of the courts of the United States as to the duties, powers, and liabilities of Marshals are:--
The marshal may have an attachment to enforce the payment of his fees of office, against suitors in the court; so also against the endorser on the writ, who by the lex loci, is liable to respond for costs. Anonymous, 2 Gallis. C. C. R. 101.
The marshal is entitled to his full commissions according to the act of 1799, chap. 19, upon all interlocutory sales.of prize property. The act of 27th January, 1813, applies only to sales after final condemnation. The Avery, 2 Gallis. C. C. R. 308.
It is the duty of the marshal, upon all interlocutory sales, to bring the proceeds into court, with a regular account of the sales. Ibid.
The marshal is entitled to commissions upon prize property, removed from his district, by consent of parties, and there sold. The San Jose Indiana, 2 Gallis. C. C. R. 311.
After a rule on the marshal to return the capias ad satisfaciendum issued against the defendants, on the return of the marshal that the plaintiff had directed him not to serve the writ on one defendant, and that the other could not be found, the court have nothing more to do with the rule. If the marshal has misconducted himself, the remedy is an action for a false return. Segourney v. Ingraham et al., 2 Wash. C. C. R. 336.
Where an individual, acting in pursuance of what he conceives a just claim to property, proceeds by legal process to enforce it, and causes a levy to be made on property which is claimed by another, without abusing or perverting its true object, there is and ought to be a very different rule for damages, from the case in which vindictive damages may be allowed, if after a due course of legal investigation, his case is not well founded. Where the defendant had acted as the marshal of the United States, in the execution of his duties as a public officer, and had made a levy, but had done nothing out of the strictest line of duty, the circuit court instructed the jury to allow compensation for the injury sustained, and nothing more. Pacific Ins. Co. v. Conard, Baldwin's C. C. R. 143.
It has long been settled that a jury ought not in any case to find exemplary damages against a public officer, acting in obedience to orders from the government, without any circumstances of aggravation, if he violates the law in making a seizure of property. Ibid.
A marshal is not removed by the appointment of a new one, until he receives notice of such appointment ; all acts done by the old marshal after the appointment of a new one, before notice, are good ; but his acts subsequent to notice are void. Wallace's C. C. R. 119.
If a debtor, committed to the state jail under process from the courts of the United States, escape, the marshal is not liable. Randolph v. Donaldson, 9 Cranch, 76; 3 Cond. Rep. 280.
The act of Congress has limited the responsibility of the marshal to his own acts and the acts of his deputies. The keeper of a state jail is, neither in fact nor in law, the deputy of the marshal; he is not appointed by, nor removable at the will of the marshal. When a prisoner is regularly committed to a state jail by the marshal, he is no longer in the custody of the marshal, or controllable by him. Ibid.
If a marshal, before the date of his official bond, receive, upon an execution, money due to the United States, with orders from the comptroller to pay it into the Bank of the United States, which he neglects to do, the sureties in his official bond, executed afterwards, are not liable therefor upon the bond ; although the money remain in the marshal's hands after the execution of the bond. The United States v. Giles and others, 9 Cranch, 212; 3 Cond. Rep. 377.
Qweri/. Whether the sureties in a marshal's bond conditioned for the faithful execution of his duty, " during his continuance in the said office," are liable for money received by him after his removal from office, upon an execution which remained in his hands at the time of such removal ? Ibid.
The comptroller of the treasury has a right to direct the marshal to whom he shall pay money received upon executions, and a payment according to such directions is good ; and it seems he may avail himself of it upon the trial without having submitted it as a claim to the accounting officers of the treasury. Ibid.
It is the duty of the marshal of a court of the United States, to execute all process which may be placed in his hands ; but he performs this duty at his peril, and under the guidance of law. He must, of course, exercise some judgment in the performance. Should he fail to obey the exigit of the writ without a legal excuse, or should he in its letter violate the rights of others, he is liable to the action of the injured party. Life and Fire Ins. Co. of New York v. Adams, 9 Peters, 573.
The marshal makes distribution of proceeds of prize sales in his hands, at his peril; and on his mispayment a libel lies against him. For safety the marshal should obtain the order of the court, which ought not to be made without previous measures guarding against fraud, and providing for latent claims, Keene etal. v. The Gloucester, 2 Dallas, 36.
