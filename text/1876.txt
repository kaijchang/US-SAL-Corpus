And sections thirty-one hundred and fifty nine, and thirty-one hundred and sixty of the Revised Statutes, and all laws and parts of laws in conflict with theprovisions of the foregoing paragraphs relating to the internal revenue service, are hereby repealed. The powers of transfer, and of suspension, of officers conferred upon supervisors by section thirty-one hundred and sixty-three of the Revised Statutes, are hereby vested in the Commissioner of Internal Revenue; and all other powers conferred, and duties imposed, by said section upon supervisors, are hereby conferred and imposed upon collectors of internal revenue within their respective districts.

thereafter as practicable, report the case to the President through the Secretary of the Treasury for such action as he may deem proper.

nue may prescribe. That the Secretary of the Treasury may, upon the recommendation of
the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, impose the duties of storekeeper and gauger upon one officer, where the amount of spirits produced at the distillery, to which such officer may be assigned, is not sufficient, in the judgment of the Commissioner to warrant the employment of two officers to perform the separate duties of storekeeper and gauger. The Secretary of the Treasury may issue a commission to such officer as storekeeper and gauger, but the compensation for his services as store-

America.

Whereas pursuant to the convention between the United States and the Mexican Republic of the 19th day of April, 1871, the functions of the joint commission under the convention between the same parties of the 4th of July, 1868, were extended for a term not exceeding one year from the day on which they were to terminate according to the convention last named;
And whereas, pursuant to the first article of the convention between the same parties, of the twentyseventh day of November, one thousand eight hundred and seventy-two, the joint commission above referred to was revived and again extended for a term not exceeding two years from the day on which the functions of the said commission would terminate pursuant to the said convention of the nineteenth day of April, 1871;
And whereas pursuant to the convention between the same parties, of the twentieth day of November, one thousand eight huudred and seventy-four, the said commission was again extended for one year from the time when it would have expired pursuant to the convention of the twenty-seventh of November, one thousand eight hundred and seventy-two, that is

to say, until the thirty-first clay of January, one thousand eight hundred and seventy-six; and it was provided that if at the expiration of that time, the umpire under the convention should not have decided all the cases which may then have been referred to him, he should be allowed a further period of not more than six months for that purpose ;
And whereas it is found to be impracticable for the umpire appointed pursuant to the convention adverted to, to decide all the cases referred to him, within the said period of six months prescribed by the convention of the twentieth of November, one thousand eight hundred and seventy-four;
And the parties being still animated by a desire that all that business should be closed as originally contemplated, the President of the United States has for this purpose conferred full powers on Hamilton Fish, Secretary of State, and the President of the Mexican Republic has conferred like powers on Don Ignacio Mariscal, Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of that Republic to the United States; and the said Plenipotentiates having exchanged their full powers, which were found to be in due form, have agreed upon the following articles:
Arti cle I.
The high contracting parties agree that if the umpire appointed under the convention above referred to shall not, on or before the expiration of the six months allowed for the purpose by the second article of the convention of the twentieth of November, one thousand eight hundred and seventy-four, have decided all the cases referred to him, he shall then be allowed a further period until the twentieth day of November, one thousand eight hundred and seventy-six, for that purpose.
Article II.
It is further agreed that so soon after the twentieth day of November, one thousand eight hundred and seventy-six, as may be practicable, the total amount awarded in

Que ya se conoce la imposibilidad de que el Arbitro nombrado en virtud de la convencion a que se alude decida todos los casos que se le han sometido, dentro de dicho periodo de seis meses senalado por la convencion del veinte Noviembre de mil ochocientos setenta y cuatro;
Y hallandose las referidas partes igualmente animadas del deseo de que todos esosnegocios queden concluidos como se estipulo originalmente, el Presidente de la Republica Mexicana ha conferido con este fin plenos poderes a Don Ignacio Mariscal; Enviado Extraordinario y Ministro Plenipotenciario de dicha Republica en los Estados Unidos, y el Presidente de los EstadosUnidoshaconferidoignales poderesHamilton Fish, Secretario de Estado.

Preamble.
Religious services recommended on 4th of July, 1876.

The Centennial Anniversary of the day on which the people of the

United States declared their right to a separate and equal station among the Powers of the Earth seems to demand an exceptional

observance. The founders of the Government at its birth and in its feebleness

invoked the blessings and the protection of a Divine Providence, and the thirteen colonies and three millions of people have expanded into a nation of strength and numbers commanding the position which then

was asserted and for which fervent prayers were then offered. It seems fitting that on the occurrence of the hundreth anniversary
of our existence as a Nation a grateful acknowledgment should be made to Almighty God for the protection and the bounties which He

has vouchsafed to our beloved country. I therefore invite the good people of the United States on the
approaching Fourth day of July, in addition to the usual observances with which they are accustomed to greet the return of the day, further, in such manner and at such time as in their respective localities and

religious associations may be most convenient, to mark its recurrence by some public religious and devout thanksgiving to Almighty God for the blessings which have been bestowed upon us as a Nation during the century of our existence, and humbly to invoke a continuance of His

favor and of His protection. In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal

of the United States to be affixed. Done at the city of Washington this twenty-sixth day of June, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and seventy-

Preamble. Turbulent and disorderly persons in South Carolina commanded to disperse.

Whereas it has been satisfactorily shown to me that insurrection and

domestic violence exist in several counties of the State of South Carolina, and that certain combinations of men against law exist in many

counties of said State known as "Rifle Clubs," who ride up and down by day and night in arms, murdering some peaceable citizens and intimidating others, which combinations, though forbidden by the laws of the State, cannot be controlled or suppressed by the ordinary course

of justice; And whereas it is provided in the Constitution of the United States
that the United States shall protect every State in this Union, on

application of the Legislature, or of the Executive when the Legislature cannot be convened, against domestic violence;
And whereas by laws in pursuance of the above it is provided (in the laws of the United States) that, in all cases of insurrection in any

State (or of obstruction to the laws thereof,) it shall be lawful for the President of the United States, on application of the Legislature of

such State, or of the Executive when the Legislature cannot be convened, to call forth the militia of any other State or States, or to

employ such part of the land and naval forces as shall be judged necessary for the purpose of suppressing such insurrection or causing the laws to be duly executed;
And whereas the Legislature of said State is not now in session and cannot be convened in time to meet the present emergency, and the

Executive of said State, under section 4 of Article IV of the Constitution of the United States and the laws passed in pursuance thereof, has therefore made due application to me in the premises for such part of the military force of the United States as may be necessary and adequate to protect said State and the citizens thereof against domestic violence, and to enforce the due execution of the laws ;
And whereas it is required that, whenever it may be necessary, in

the judgment of the President, to use the military force for the purpose aforesaid, he shall forthwith, by proclamation, command such insur-

gents to disperse and retire peaceably to their respective, homes within a limited time:

Now, therefore, I, Ulys ses S. Gran t , President of the United States, do hereby make proclamation, and command all persons engaged in

said unlawful and insurrectionary proceedings to disperse and retire peaceably to their respective abodes within three days from this date, and hereafter abandon said combinations and submit themselves to the laws and constituted authorities of said State.
And I invoke the aid and co-operation of all good citizens thereof to uphold the laws and preserve the public peace.
In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.

A PROCLAMATION.

From year to year we have been accustomed to pause in our daily pursuits, and set apart a time to offer our thanks to Almighty God for

the special blessings He has vouchsafed to us, with our prayers for a continuance thereof.

We have at this time equal reason to be thankful for His continued pro-

tection,andfor themany material blessings whichHisbountyhas bestowed. In addition to these favors accorded to us as individuals, we have es-
pecial occasion to express our hearty thanks to Almighty God that by His providence and guidance our Government, established a century ago, has been enabled to fulfil the purpose of its founders in offering an asylum to the people of every race, securing civil and religious liberty

to all within its borders, and meting out to every individual alike justice and equality before the law.

It is moreover especially our duty to offer our humble prayers to the Father of all mercies for a continuance of His Divine favor to us as a nation and as individuals.

By reason of all these considerations, I, Ulys ses S. Gran t , President of the United States, do recommend to the people of the United States to devote the 30th day of November next, to the expression of their thanks and prayers to Almighty God, and, laying aside their daily avocations and all secular occupations, to assemble in their respective places of worship, and observe such day as a day of Thanksgiving and rest.

Preamble. Nov. 25, 1875, set for a day of thanksgiving.

In accordance with a practice at once wise and beautiful, we have been accustomed, as the year is drawing to a close, to devote an occasion to the humble expression of our thanks to Almighty God for the ceaseless and distinguished benefits bestowed upon us as a nation, and for His mercies and protection during the closing year.
Amid the rich and free enjoyment of all our advantages, we should not forget the source from whence they are derived, and the extent of our obligation to the Father of all mercies.
We have full reason to renew our thanks to Almighty God for favors bestowed upon us during the past year.
By His continuing mercy, civil and religious liberty have been maintained, peace has reigned within our borders, labor and enterprise have produced their merited rewards, and to His watchful providence we afe indebted for security from pestilence and other national calamity.
Apart from national blessings, each individual among us has occasion to thoughtfully recall and devoutly recognize the favors and protection which he has enjoyed.
Now, therefore, I, Ulysses S. Grant , President of the United States, do recommend that on Thursday, the 25th day of November, the people of the United States, abstaining from all secular pursuits and from their accustomed avocations, do assemble in their respective places of worship, and, in such form as may seem most appropriate in their own hearts, offer to Almighty God their acknowledgments and thanks for all His mercies, and their humble prayers for a continuance of His divine favor.
In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of. the United States to be affixed.
Done at the city of Washington this 27th day of October, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and seventy-
