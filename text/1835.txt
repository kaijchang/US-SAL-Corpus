Cha p. XXVIII.--An Act supplementary to an act entitled "An act to authorize the extension, construction, and use of a lateral branch of the Baltimore and Ohio railroad into and within the District of Columbia," passed December, eighteen hundred and twenty-nine. (a)
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America, in Congress assembled, That the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company be, and they are hereby, authorized to locate and construct their said road within the city of Washington, through squares nine hundred and nine, eight hundred and eighty-eight, eight hundred and fifty-eight, eight hundred and thirty-two, nine hundred and eight, eight hundred and eighty-seven, eight hundred and fifty-six, eight hundred and fifty-seven, eight hundred and thirty-one, eight hundred and seven, seven hundred and seventy-six, seven hundred and fifty-one, seven hundred and eighteen, in the same manner, and with the same rights and privileges which are granted to them by the act to which this is a supplement, for the construction of their said road within the District of Columbia, beyond the limits of the city of Washington, any thing in the said act contained to
the contrary notwithstanding, and the assent of Congress is hereby given to the construction of the said railroad through or over any of the said lots or parts of lots which are owned by the United States.

Statute II.
March 3, 1835.
1831, ch. 85.
Construction of road within the District of Columbia.

(a) The following decision of the Supreme Court is introduced, as it is one of the occasions in which the Baltimore and Ohio railroad has been the subject of the legislation of Congress.
The state of Maryland, in 1836, passed a law directing a subscription of three millions of dollars to be made to the capital stock of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, with the following proviso, " that if the said company shall not locate the said road in the manner provided in this act, then and in that case, they shall forfeit one million of dollars to the state of Maryland, for the use of Washington county." In March, 1840, the state passed another act, repealing so much of the prior act as made it the duty of the company to construct the road by the route therein prescribed, remitting and releasing the penalty, and directing the discontinuance of any suit brought to recover the same. Held, that the proviso was a measure of state policy, which it had a right to change, if that policy was afterwards discovered to be erroneous; and neither the commissioners, nor the county, nor any one of its citizens, acquired any separate or private interest under it, which could be maintained in a court of justice. State of Maryland v. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, 3 Howard, 534.
It was a penalty, intended to be imposed on the company for disobeying the law; and the assent of the company to it, as a supplemental charter, was not sufficient to deprive it of the character of a penalty. Ibid.
A clause of forfeiture in a law is to be construed differently from a similar clause in an engagement between individuals. A legislature can impose it as a punishment; but individuals can only make it a matter of contract. Being a penalty, imposed by law, the legislature had a right to remit it. Ibid.

the contrary notwithstanding, and the assent of Congress is hereby given to the construction of the said railroad through or over any of the said lots or parts of lots which are owned by the United States.

Statute II.
March 3, 1835.
1831, ch. 85.
Construction of road within the District of Columbia.

(a) The following decision of the Supreme Court is introduced, as it is one of the occasions in which the Baltimore and Ohio railroad has been the subject of the legislation of Congress.
The state of Maryland, in 1836, passed a law directing a subscription of three millions of dollars to be made to the capital stock of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, with the following proviso, " that if the said company shall not locate the said road in the manner provided in this act, then and in that case, they shall forfeit one million of dollars to the state of Maryland, for the use of Washington county." In March, 1840, the state passed another act, repealing so much of the prior act as made it the duty of the company to construct the road by the route therein prescribed, remitting and releasing the penalty, and directing the discontinuance of any suit brought to recover the same. Held, that the proviso was a measure of state policy, which it had a right to change, if that policy was afterwards discovered to be erroneous; and neither the commissioners, nor the county, nor any one of its citizens, acquired any separate or private interest under it, which could be maintained in a court of justice. State of Maryland v. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, 3 Howard, 534.
It was a penalty, intended to be imposed on the company for disobeying the law; and the assent of the company to it, as a supplemental charter, was not sufficient to deprive it of the character of a penalty. Ibid.
A clause of forfeiture in a law is to be construed differently from a similar clause in an engagement between individuals. A legislature can impose it as a punishment; but individuals can only make it a matter of contract. Being a penalty, imposed by law, the legislature had a right to remit it. Ibid.

Where there is a deviation from the voyage in the shipping articles, a refusal of the seamen, subsequently, to do duty on that account, does not amount in law to an endeavour to commit a revolt, under the act of Congress of 1835, ch. 40, sec. 2.

To sustain an indictment for an endeavour to make a revolt, under the act of Congress of 1835, ch. 40, sec. 2, a confederacy or combination must be shown, between two or more of the seamen, to refuse to do further duty on board of the ship, and to resist the lawful commands of the officers.

(a) Revolt.
Where there is a deviation from the voyage in the shipping articles, a refusal of the seamen, subsequently, to do duty on that account, does not amount in law to an endeavour to commit a revolt, under the act of Congress of 1835, ch. 40, sec. 2. United States v. John Mathews, 2 Sumner's C. C. R. 470.
To sustain an indictment for an endeavour to make a revolt, under the act of Congress of 1835, ch. 40, sec. 2, a confederacy or combination must be shown, between two or more of the seamen, to refuse to do further duty on board of the ship, and to resist the lawful commands of the officers. The United States v. Alfred Cassedy et al., 2 Sumner's C. C. R. 582.
The contract of seamen for the voyage is not suspended or extinguished by the death, removal, or resignation of the original master; but they are bound to perform the voyage under any person who is lawfully substituted in his place. Ibid.
If a person substituted as master be grossly incompetent to the duties of his station, from want of

waters within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States, shall unlawfully, wilfully, and with force, or by fraud, threats, or other intimidations, usurp the command of such ship or vessel from the master or other lawful commanding officer thereof, or deprive him of his authority and command on board thereof, or resist or prevent him in the free and lawful exercise thereof, or transfer such authority and command to any other person not lawfully entitled thereto, every such person so offending, his aiders or abettors, shall be deemed guilty of a revolt or mutiny and felony; and shall, on conviction thereof, be punished by fine not exceeding two thousand dollars; and by imprisonment and confinement to hard labour not exceeding ten years, according to the nature and aggravation of the offence. And the offence of making a revolt in a ship, which now is, under and in virtue of the eighth section of the act of Congress, passed the thirtieth day of April, in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and ninety, punishable as a capital offence, shall, from and after the passage of the present act, be no longer punishable as a capital offence, but shall be punished in the manner prescribed in the present act, and not otherwise.
Sec . 2. And be itfurther enacted, That if any one or more of the crew of any American ship or vessel on the high seas, or any other waters, within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States, shall endeavour to make a revolt or mutiny on board such ship or vessel, or shall combine, conspire or confederate with any other person or persons on board to make such revolt or mutiny, or shall solicit, incite or stir up any other or others of the crew to disobey or resist the lawful orders of the master, or other officer of such ship or vessel, or to refuse or neglect their proper duty on board thereof, or to betray their proper trust therein, or shall assemble with others in a tumultuous and mutinous manner, or make a riot on board thereof, or shall unlawfully confine the master, or other commanding officer thereof, every such person so offending shall, on conviction thereof, be punished by fine, not exceeding one thousand dollars, or by imprisonment not exceeding five years, or by both, according to the nature and aggravation of the offence.
Sec . 3. And be it further enacted, That if any master or other officer,(a) of any American ship or vessel on the high seas, or on any other waters within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States, shall from malice, hatred or revenge, and without justifiable cause, beat, wound, or imprison, any one or more of the crew of such ship or vessel, or withhold from them suitable food and nourishment, or inflict upon them

skill or bad habits, or profligate and cruel behaviour, the seamen may be justified in refusing to do duty or to remain by the ship. Ibid.
The act of 1835, ch. 40, provides, " That if any one or more of the crew of an American ship or vessel on the high seas, &c., shall endeavour to make a revolt, &c., he and they shall be punished as provided
in the act." Held, that a ship engaged in a whaling voyage, without having surrendered her register, or taken out an enrolment and license pursuant to the act of 1793, ch. 8, was not an American ship, within the purview of the act of 1835, ch. 40, and that an indictment would not hold, under this act, against the crew, for an endeavour to make a revolt. The United States v. Rogers, 3 Sumner's C. C. R. 342.
(a) The act of Congress of 1835, ch. 40, sec. 3, for the punishment of certain maritime offences, provides, " that if any master or other officer of an American ship orvessel shall, from malice, hatred, or re-
venge, and without justifiable cause, beat, wound or imprison any one or more of the crew of such ship or vessel," &c., he shall be punished in the manner stated in the act. Held, that "malice," in the sense of the act, signified wilfulness, or a wilful intention to do a wrongful act, and that to authorize a conviction under this act, two things must be shown: first, malice, or hatred, or revenge; and, secondly, a want of justifiable cause to inflict the injury. United States v. Otis Taylor, 2 Sumner's C. C. R. 584.
The master, when on board, has generally the sole authority to authorize punishment to be inflicted on any of the crew, and if he is present when punishment is inflicted by a subordinate officer, and can prevent it, and does not, he is personally responsible for the act; and neither the mate nor any subordinate officer has authority to punish any seaman, even for improper behaviour to himself personally, when the master is on board, except by authority, express or implied, by the master, or when the necessities of the service require instantaneous punishment, as by blows or otherwise, to compel a seaman to his duty. Ibid.
In the absence of the master, the next highest officer on board succeeds to his right and authority, pro tempore, so far as they are necessary for the due performance of the ship's duties. Ibid.

any cruel and unusual punishment, every such person so offending shall, on conviction thereof, be punished by fine, not exceeding one thousand dollars, or by imprisonment not exceeding five years, or by both, according to the nature and aggravation of the offence.
Sec . 4. And be it further enacted, That whenever any person indicted for any offence against the United States, whether capital or otherwise, shall upon his arraignment stand mute, or will not plead or answer thereto, it shall be the duty of the court to enter the plea of not guilty on his behalf, in the same manner as if he had pleaded not guilty thereto. And when the party shall plead not guilty, or such plea shall be entered as aforesaid, the cause shall be deemed at issue, and shall, without further form or ceremony, be tried by a jury. And in all trials in capital cases, if the party indicted shall peremptorily challenge above the number of jurors allowed by law, such excess of challenges shall be disallowed by the court, and the cause shall proceed for trial in the same manner as if the same [said] challenges had not been made.
Sec . 5. And be it further enacted, That whenever any person shall be convicted of any offence against the United States which is punishable by fine and imprisonment, or by either, it shall be lawful for the court by which the sentence is passed, to order the sentence to be executed in any house of correction, or house of reformation for juvenile delinquents within the state or district where such court is holden, the use of which shall be allowed and authorized by the legislature of the state for such purpose. And the expenses attendant upon the execution of such sentence shall be paid by the United States.

ARTICLES OF A TREATY,

Dec, 29, 1835. Proclamation, May 23, 1836.

Concluded at New Echota in the State of Georgia on the 29th day of Deer. 1835 by General William Carroll and John E. Schermerhorn commissioners on the part of the United States and the Chiefs Head Men and People of the Cherokee tribe of Indians.

Preamble.

Whe rea s the Cherokees are anxious to make some arrangements with the Government of the United States whereby the difficulties they have experienced by a residence within the settled parts of the United States under the jurisdiction and laws of the State Governments may be terminated and adjusted; and with a view to reuniting their people in one body and securing a permanent home for themselves and their posterity in the country selected by their forefathers without the territorial limits of the State sovereignties, and where they can establish and enjoy a government of their choice and perpetuate such a state of society as may be most consonant with their views,habits and condition; and as may tend to their individual comfort and their advancement in civilization.
And whereas a delegation of the Cherokee nation composed of Messrs. John Ross Richard Taylor Dani. McCoy Samuel Gunter and William Rogers with full power and authority to conclude a treaty with the United States did on the 28th day of February 1835 stipulate and agree with the Government of the United States to submit to the Senate to fix the amount which should be allowed the Cherokees for their claims and for a cession of their lands east of the Mississippi river, and did
agree to abide by the award of the Senate of the United States themselves and to recommend the same to their people for their final determination.
And whereas on such submission the Senate advised " that a sum not exceeding five millions of dollars be paid to the Cherokee Indians for all their lands and possessions east of the Mississippi river."
And whereas this delegation after said award of the Senate had been made, were called upon to submit propositions as to its disposition to be arranged in a treaty which they refused to do, but insisted that the same " should be referred to their nation and there in general council to deliberate and determine on the subject in order to ensure harmony and good feeling among themselves."
And whereas a certain other delegation composed of John Ridge Elias Boudinot Archilia Smith S. W. Bell John West Wm. A. Davis and Ezekiel West, who represented that portion of the nation in favor of emigration to the Cherokee country west of the Mississippi entered into propositions for a treaty with John F. Schermerhorn commissioner on the part of the United States which were to be submitted to their nation for their final action and determination:
And whereas the Cherokee people, at their last October council at
Red Clay, fully authorized and empowered a delegation or committee of twenty persons of their nation to enter into and conclude a treaty
with the United States commissioner then present, at that place or elsewhere and as the people had good reason to believe that a treaty would then and there be made or at a subsequent council at New Echota which the commissioners it was well known and understood, were authorized
(478)

TREATY WITH THE CHEROKEES. 1835.

and instructed to convene for said purpose; and since the said delegation have gone on to Washington city, with a view to close negotiations there, as stated by them notwithstanding they were officially informed by the United States commissioner that they would not be received by the President of the United States; and that the Government would transact no business of this nature with them, and that if a treaty was made it must be done here in the nation, where the delegation at Washington last winter urged that it should be done for the purpose of promoting peace and harmony among the people; and since these facts have also been corroborated to us by a communication recently received by the commissioner from the Government of the United States and read and explained to the people in open council and therefore believing said delegation can effect nothing and since our difficulties are daily increasing and our situation is rendered more and more precarious uncertain and insecure in consequence of the legislation of the States; and seeing no effectual way of relief, but in accepting the liberal overtures of the United States.
And whereas Genl William Carroll and John F. Schermerhorn were appointed commissioners on the part of the United States, with full power and authority to conclude a treaty with the Cherokees east and were directed by the President to convene the people of the nation in general council at New Echota and to submit said propositions to them with power and authority to vary the same so as to meet the views of the Cherokees in reference to its details.
And whereas the said commissioners did appoint and notify a general council of the nation to convene at New Echota on the 21st day of December 1835 ; and informed them that the commissioners would be prepared to make a treaty with the Cherokee people who should assemble there and those who did not come they should conclude gave their assent and sanction to whatever should be transacted at this council and the people having met in council according to said notice.
Therefore the following articles of a treaty are agreed upon and concluded between William Carroll and John F. Schermerhorn commissioners on the part of the United States and the chiefs and head men and people of the Cherokee nation in general council assembled this 29th day of Deer 1835.
Arti cle 1. The Cherokee nation hereby cede relinquish and convey to the United States all the lands owned claimed or possessed by them east of the Mississippi river, and hereby release all their claims upon the United States for spoliations of every kind for and in consideration of the sum of five millions of dollars to be expended paid and invested in the manner stipulated and agreed upon in the following articles But as a question has arisen between the commissioners and the Cherokees whether the Senate in their resolution by which they advised " that a sum not exceeding five millions of dollars be paid to the Cherokee Indians for all their lands and possessions east of the Mississippi river" have included and made any allowance or consideration for claims for spoiliations it is therefore agreed on the part of the United States that this question shall be again submitted to the Senate for their consideration and decision and if no allowance was made for spoiliations that then an additional sum of three hundred thousand dollars be allowed for the same.
Arti cle 2. Whereas by the treaty of May 6th 1828 and the supplementary treaty thereto of Feb. 14th 1833 with the Cherokees west of the Mississippi the United States guarantied and secured to be conveyed by patent, to the Cherokee nation of Indians the following tract of country " Beginning at a point on the old western territorial line of Arkansas Territory-being twenty-five miles north from the point where

the territorial line crosses Arkansas river, thence running from said north point south on the said territorial line where the said territorial line crosses Verdigris river; thence down said Verdigris river to the Arkansas river; thence down said Arkansas to a point where a stone is placed opposite the east or lower bank of Grand river at its junction with the Arkansas; thence running south forty-four degrees west one mile; thence in a straight line to a point four miles northerly, from the mouth of the north fork of the Canadian; thence along the said four mile line to the Canadian; thence down the Canadian to the Arkansas ; whence down the Arkansas to that point on the Arkansas where the eastern Choctaw boundary strikes said river and running thence with the western line of Arkansas Territory as now defined, to the southwest corner of Missouri; thence along the western Missouri line to the land assigned the Senecas; thence on the south line of the Senecas to Grand river; thence up said Grand river as far as the south line of the Osage reservation, extended if necessary; thence up and between said south Osage line extended west if necessary, and a line drawn due west from the point of beginning to a certain distance west, at which a line running north and south from said Osage line to said due west line will make seven millions of acres within the whole described boundaries. In addition to the seven millions of acres of land thus provided for and bounded, the United States further guaranty to the Cherokee nation a perpetual outlet west, and a free and unmolested use of all the country west of the western boundary of said seven millions of acres, as far west as the sovereignty of the United States and their right of soil extend:
Provided however That if the saline or salt plain on the western prairie shall fall within said limits prescribed for said outlet, the right is reserved to the United States to permit other tribes of red men to get salt on said plain in common with the Cherokees; And letters pattent shall be issued by the United States as soon as practicable for the land hereby guarantied."
And whereas it is apprehended by the Cherokees that in the above cession there is not contained a sufficient quantity of land for the accommodation of the whole nation on their removal west of the Mississippi the United States in consideration of the sum of five hundred thousand dollars therefore hereby covenant and agree to convey to the said Indians, and their descendants by patent, in fee simple the following additional tract of land situated between the west line of the. State of Missouri and the Osage reservation beginning at the southeast corner of the same and runs north along the east line of the Osage lands fifty miles to the northeast corner thereof; and thence east to the west line of the State of Missouri; thence with said line sputh fifty miles; thence west to the place of beginning; estimated to contain eight hundred thousand acres of land; but it is expressly understood that if any of the lands assigned the Quapaws shall fall within the aforesaid bounds the same shall be reserved and excepted out of the lands above granted and a pro rata reduction shall be made in the price to be allowed to the United States for the same by the Cherokees.

Further agreement.
1830, ch. 148. Right to establish forts, &c.

Arti cle 3. The United States also agree that the lands above ceded by the treaty of Feb. 14 1833, including the outlet, and those ceded by this treaty shall all be included in one patent executed to the Cherokee nation of Indians by the President of the United States according to the provisions of the act of May 28 1830. It is, however, agreed that the military reservation at Fort Gibson shall be held by the United States. But should the United States abandon said post and have no further use for the same it shall revert to the Cherokee nation. The United States shall always have the right to make and establish such post and military

roads and forts in any part of the Cherokee country, as they may deem proper for the interest and protection of the same and the free use of as much land, timber, fuel and materials of all kinds for the construction
and support of the same as may be necessary; provided that if the private rights of individuals are interfered with, a just compensation there-
for shall be made.

Arti cle 4. The United States also stipulate and agree to extinguish for the benefit of the Cherokees the titles to the reservations within their country made in the Osage treaty of 1825 to certain half-breeds and for this purpose they hereby agree to pay to the persons to whom the same belong or have been assigned or to their agents or guardians whenever they shall execute after the ratification of this treaty a satisfactory con-
veyance for the same, to the United States, the sum of fifteen thousand dollars according to a schedule accompanying this treaty of the relative value of the several reservations.
And whereas by the several treaties between the United States and the Osage Indians the Union and Harmony Missionary reservations which were established for their benefit are now situated within the country ceded by them to the United States; the former being situated in the Cherokee country and the latter in the State of Missouri. It is therefore agreed that the United States shall pay the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions for the improvements on the same what they shall be appraised at by Capt. Geo. Vashon Cherokee sub-agent Abraham Redfield and A. P. Chouteau or such persons as the President of the United States shall appoint and the money allowed for the same shall be expended in schools among the Osages and improving their condition. It is understood that the United States are to pay the amount allowed for the reservations in this article and not the Cherokees.

Arti cle 5. The United States hereby covenant and agree that the lands ceded to the Cherokee nation in the foregoing article shall, in no future time without their consent, be included within the territorial limits or jurisdiction of any State or Territory. But they shall secure to the Cherokee nation the right by their national councils to make and carry into effect all such laws as they may deem necessary for the government and protection of the persons and property within their own country belonging to their people or such persons as have connected themselves with them: provided always that they shall not be inconsistent with the constitution of the United States and such acts of Congress as have been or may be passed regulating trade and intercourse with the Indians; and also, that they shall not be considered as extending to such citizens and army of the United States as may travel or reside in the Indian country by permission according to the laws and regulations established by the Government of the same.

Article 6. Perpetual peace and friendship shall exist between the

citizens of the United States and the Cherokee Indians. The United

country and not make war upon their neighbors they shall also be. pro-

tected against interruption and intrusion from citizens of the United

TREATY WITH THE CHEROKEES. 1835.

485

reservations under this article shall not be deducted out of the consideration money allowed to the Cherokees for their claims for spoliations and the cession of their lands; but the same is to be paid for independently by the United States as it is only a just fulfilment of former
treaty stipulations.

Arti cle 14. It is also agreed on the part of the United States that
such warriors of the Cherokee nation as were engaged on the side of the United States in the late war with Great Britain and the southern tribes of Indians, and who were wounded in such service shall be entitled to such pensions as shall be allowed them by the Congress of the United States to commence from the period of their disability.

And it is also stipulated and agreed that the public buildings and improvements on which they are situated at New Echota for which no grant has been actually made previous to the passage of the above recited act if not occupied by the Cherokee people shall be reserved for the public and free use of the United States and the Cherokee Indians for the purpose of settling and closing all the Indian business

Arti cle 18. Whereas in consequence of the unsettled affairs of the Cherokee people and the early frosts, their crops are insufficient to support their families and great distress is likely to ensue and whereas the nation will not, until after their removal be able advantageously to expend the income of the permanent funds of the nation it is therefore agreed that the annuities of the nation which may accrue under this treaty for two years, the time fixed for their removal shall be expended in provision and clothing for the benefit of the poorer class of the nation; and the United States hereby agree to advance the same for that purpose as soon after the ratification of this treaty as an appropriation for the same shall be made.

SUPPLEMENTARY ARTICLES TO A TREATY

March 1, 1836.
Proclamation, May 23, 1836.

Concluded at New Echota, Georgia, December 29, 1835, between the United States and Cherokee people.
Wher eas the undersigned were authorised at the general meeting of the Cherokee people held at New Echota as above stated, to make and assent to such alterations in the preceding treaty as might be thought necessary, and whereas the President of the United States has expressed his determination not to allow any pre-emptions or reservations his desire being that the whole Cherokee people should remove together and establish themselves in the country provided for them west of the Mississippi river.

Pre-emption rights declared void.

Arti cle 1. It is therefore agreed that all the pre-emption rights and reservations provided for in articles 12 and 13 shall be and are hereby relinquished and declared void.

Arti cle 2. Whereas the Cherokee people have supposed that the sum of five millions of dollars fixed by the Senate in their resolution of-----day of March, 1835, as the value of the Cherokee lands and possessions east of the Mississippi river was not intended to include the amount which may be required to remove them, nor the value of certain claims which many of their people had against citizens of the United States, which suggestion has been confirmed by the opinion expressed to the War Department by some of the Senators who voted upon the question and whereas the President is willing that this subject should be referred to the Senate for their consideration and if it was not intended by the Senate that the above-mentioned sum of five millions of dollars should include the objects herein specified that in that case such further provision should be made therefor as might appear to the Senate to be just.

Allowance in Arti cle 3. It is therefore agreed that the sum of six hundred thou-

lieu of pre-emp- sand dollars shall be and the same is hereby allowed to the Cherokee

tions, &e.

people to include the expense of their removal, and all claims of every

CONVENTION WITH MEXICO.
A tr eat y having been concluded and signed in the city of Mexico, on the 12th day of January, 1828, between the United States of America and the Mexican United States, for the purpose of establishing the true dividing line and boundary between the two nations, the third article of which treaty is as follows : " To fix this line with more precision, and to place the land marks which shall designate exactly the limits of both nations, each of the contracting parties shall appoint a commissioner and a surveyor, who shall meet before the termination of one year from the date of the ratification of this treaty at Natchitoches, on the Red river, and proceed to run and mark said line from the mouth of the Sabine to the Red river, and from the Red river to the river Arkansas, and to ascertain the latitude of the source of said river Arkansas, in conformity to what is agreed upon and stipulated, and the line of latitude 42 to the South sea. They shall make out plans, and keep journals of their proceedings, and the result agreed upon by them shall be considered as part of this treaty, and shall have the same force as if it were inserted therein. The two Governments will amicably agree respecting the necessary articles to be furnished to those persons, and also as to their respective escorts, should such be deemed necessary: And the ratifications of said treaty having been exchanged in the city of Washington, on the fifth day of April, in the year of 1832, but from various causes the contracting parties have been unable to perform the stipulations contained in the above mentioned third article, and the period within which the said stipulations could have been executed, has elapsed:--and both republics being desirous that the said treaty should be carried into effect with all due solemnity, the President of the United States of America has for that purpose fully empowered on his part Anthony Butler, a citizen thereof and Charge d'Affaires of said States in Mexico, and the acting President of the United Mexican States having in like manner fully empowered on his part their Excellencies Jose Maria Gutierrez de Estrada, Secretary of State for Home and Foreign Affairs, and Jose Mariano Blasco, Secretary of the Treasury ; and the said Plenipotentiaries after having mutually exchanged their full powers, found to be ample and in form, they have agreed and do hereby agree to the following second additional article to the said treaty.
Within the space of one year, to be estimated from the date of the exchange of the ratifications of this said additional article, there shall be appointed by the Government of the United States of America and of the Mexican United States, each a commissioner and surveyor, for the purpose of fixing with more precision the dividing line, and for establishing the land marks of boundary and limits between the two nations, with the exactness stipulated by the third article of the Treaty of Limits, concluded and signed in Mexico on the 12th day of January, 1828, and the ratifications of which were exchanged in Washington city on the 5th day of April, 1832. And the present additional article shall have the same force and effect as if it had been inserted word for word in the above mentioned treaty of the 12th of January, 1828, and shall be approved and ratified in the manner prescribed by the constitutions of the respective States.

Fellow-citizens of the United States! The threat of unhallowed disunion-- the names of those once respected, by whom it is uttered--the array of military force to support it--denote the approach of a crisis in our affairs, on which the continuance of our unexampled prosperity, our political existence, and perhaps that of all free governments may depend. The conjuncture demanded a free, a full, and explicit enunciation, not only of my intentions, but of my principles of action ; and as the claim was asserted of a right by a State to annul the laws of the Union, and even to secede from it at pleasure, a frank exposition of my opinions in relation to the origin and form of our government, and the construction I give to the instrument by which it was created, seemed to be proper. Having the fullest confidence in the justness of the legal and constitutional opinion of my duties, which has been expressed, I rely, with equal confidence, on your undivided support in my determination to execute the laws--to preserve the Union by all constitutional means--to arrest, if possible, by moderate but firm measures, the necessity of a recourse to force ; and, if it be the will of Heaven, that the recurrence of its primeval curse on man for the shedding of a brother's blood should fall upon our land, that it be not called down by any offensive act on the part of the United States.
Fellow-citizens! The momentous case is before you. On your undivided support of your government depends the decision of the great question it involves, whether your sacred Union will be preserved, and the blessing it secures to us as one people, shall be perpetuated. No one can doubt that the unanimity with which that decision will be expressed, will be such as to inspire new confidence in republican institutions, and that the prudence, the wisdom, and the courage which it will bring to their defence, will transmit them unimpaired and invigorated to our children.
May the great Ruler of Nations grant that the signal blessings with which he has favored ours, may not, by the madness of party or personal ambition, be disregarded and lost; and may his wise Providence bring those who have produced this crisis to see the folly, before they feel the misery of civil strife; and inspire a returning veneration for that Union which, if we may dare to penetrate his designs, he has chosen as the only means of attaining the high destinies to which we may reasonably aspire.
In testimony whereof, I have caused the seal of the United States to be hereunto affixed, having signed the same with my hand.
Done at the city of Washington, this 10th day of December, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and thirty-two, and of the
