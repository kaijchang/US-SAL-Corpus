A PROCLAMATION.

Whe re as a convention, between the United States of America and the Republic of Peru, was concluded and signed by their respective plenipotentiaries, at Lima, on the twenty-second day of July, one thousand eight hundred and fifty-six; which convention, being in the English and Spanish languages, is, word for word, as follows :

The United States of America and the Republic of Peru, in order to render still more intimate thenrelations of friendship and good understanding, and desiring, for the benefit of their respective commerce and that of other nations, to establish an uniform system of maritime legislation in time of war, in accordance with the present state of civilization, have resolved to declare, by means of a formal convention, the principles which the two republics acknowledge as the basis of the rights of neutrals at sea, and which they recognize and profess as permanent and immutable, considering them as the true and indispensable conditions of all freedom of navigation and maritime commerce and trade.
For this purpose, the President of the United States of America has conferred full powers on John Randolph Clay, their envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to
the government of Peru; and the Liberator President of the republic of Peru has conferred like full powers on Don José Maria Seguin, chief officer of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in charge of that department, who, after having exchanged their said full powers, found to be in good and due form, have agreed upon and concluded the following articles :

La República del Perú y los Estados Unidos de América, á fin de estrechar mas y mas cada dia sus cordiales relaciones de amistad y buena inteligencia, y deseando, en bien de su comercio respectivo y del de todas las naciones, contribuir á que sea una sola, como lo exige la actual civilización, la legislación marítima universal en tiempo de guerra, han resuelto consignar en una convención especial, los principios en que las dos repúblicas fundan los derechos de los neutrales en la mar, y que ambas reconocen y profesan como permanentes é inmutables,
considerándolos absolutamente necesarios para la verdadera libertad de la navigation y de todo comercio y tráfico marítimo.
Con tal objeto el Libertador Presidente de la República del Perú ha conferido plenos poderes á Don José Maria Seguin, Oficial Mayor del
Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores, encargado de su despacho; y el
Presidente de los Estados Unidos de América ha conferido iguales plenos poderes á Don Juan Randolfo Clay,
Enviado Extraordinario y Ministro Plenipotenciario de los referidos Estados cerca del gobierno del Perú; quienes después de haber canjeado sus dichos plenos poderes, que hallaron en buena y debida forma, han convenido en los artículos siguientes:

That the property of neutrals on board of an enemy's vessel is not subject to detention or confiscation, unless the same be contraband of war; it being also understood that, as far as regards the two contracting parties, warlike articles, destined for the use of either of them, shall not be considered as contraband of war.
The two high contracting parties engage to apply these principles to the commerce and navigation of all Powers and States as shall consent to adopt them as permanent and immutable.

Los buques libres hacen libres las mercaderías; es decir, que los efectos ó mercaderías pertenecientes á una potencia ó nación que se halla en guerra con otra, ó á sus ciudadanos ó súbditos, están libres de presa ó confiscación si se encuentran á bordo de buques neutrales, con excepción de los artículos de contrabando de guerra.
2o. Que las propiedades neutrales á bordo de un buque enemigo no están sujetas á detención ó confiscación, salvo que sean contrabando de guerra; entendiéndose que, en cuanto á las dos partes contratantes no se considerará tal contrabando de guerra los artículos bélicos destinados al uso y servicio de cada una de ellas.

and criminal offences will be punished, in the case of American offenders, by the consul, according to American laws, and in the case of Siamese offenders by their own laws, through the Siamese authorities. But the consul shall not interfere in any matters referring solely to Siamese; neither will the Siamese authorities interfere in questions which only concern the citizens of the United States.
Art ic le III. If Siamese in the employ of American citizens offend against the laws of their country, or if any Siamese, having so offended, or desiring to desert, take refuge with American citizens in Siam, they shall be searched for, and, upon proof of their guilt or desertion, shall be delivered up by the consul to the Siamese authorities. In like manner, any American offenders, resident or trading in Siam, who may desert, escape to, or hide themselves in Siamese territory, shall be apprehended and delivered over to the American consul on his requisition.
Art ic le IV. American citizens are permitted to trade freely in all the seaports of Siam, but may reside permanently only at Bangkok, or within the limits assigned by this treaty.
American citizens coming to reside at Bangkok may rent land and buy or build houses, but cannot purchase land within a circuit of two hundred seng (not more than four miles English) from the city walls, until they shall have lived in Siam for ten years, or shall obtain special authority from the Siamese government to enable them to do so. But with the exception of this limitation American residents in Siam may, at any time, buy or rent houses, lands, or plantations situated anywhere within a distance of twenty-four hours' journey from the city of Bangkok, to be computed by the rate at which boats of the country can travel. In order to obtain possession of such lands or houses it will be necessary that the American citizen shall, in the first place, make application through the consul to the proper Siamese officer, and the Siamese officer and the consul, having satisfied themselves of the honest intentions of the applicant, will assist him in settling, upon equitable terms, the amount of the purchase money; will make out and fix the boundaries of the property, and will convey the same to the American purchaser under sealed deeds, whereupon he and his property shall be placed under the protection of the governor of the district, and that of the particular local authorities. He shall conform in ordinary matters to any just direction given him by them, and will be subject to the same taxation that is levied on Siamese subjects. But if, through negligence, the want of capital, or other cause, an American citizen should fail to commence the cultivation or improvements of the lands so acquired within a term of three years from the date of receiving possession thereof, the Siamese government shall have the power of resuming the property upon returning to the American citizen the purchase-money paid by him for the same.
Art ic le V. All American citizens visiting or residing in Siam shall be allowed the free exercise of their religion, and liberty to build places of worship in such localities as shall be consented to by the Siamese authorities. The Siamese government will place no restriction upon the employment by the Americans of Siamese subjects as servants, or in any

TREATY WITH THE KINGDOM OF SIAM. May 29, 1856.

685

other capacity. But wherever a Siamese subject belongs or owes service to some particular master, the servant who engages himself to an American citizen without the consent of his master may be reclaimed by him, and the Siamese government will not enforce an agreement between an American citizen and any Siamese in his employ, unless made with the knowledge and consent of the master who has a right to dispose of the services of the person engaged.
Arti cle VI. American ships-of-war may enter the river and anchor at Paknam; but they shall not proceed above Paknam unless with the consent of the Siamese authorities, which shall be given where it is necessary that a ship shall go into dock for repairs. Any American ship-ofwar conveying to Siam a public functionary, accredited by the American government to the Court of Bangkok, shall be allowed to come up to Bangkok, but shall not pass the forts called Phrachamit and Pit-pachnuck, unless expressly permitted to do so by the Siamese government. But, in the absence of an American ship-of-war, the Siamese authorities engage to furnish the consul with a force sufficient to enable him to give effect to his authority over American citizens, and to enforce discipline among American shipping.
Art ic le VII. The measurement duty hitherto paid by American vessels trading to Bangkok under the treaty of 1833 shall be abolished from the date of this treaty coming into operation, and American shipping or trade will thenceforth only be subject to the payment of import and export duties on the goods landed or shipped.
On the articles of import the duty shall be three per cent., payable, at the option of the importer, either in kind or money, calculated upon the market value of the goods. Drawback of the full amount of duty shall be allowed upon goods found unsaleable and reexported. Should the American merchant and the custom-house officers disagree as to the value to be set upon imported articles, such disputes shall be referred to the consul and a proper Siamese officer, who shall each have the power to call in an equal number of merchants as assessors, not exceeding two on either side, to assist them in coming to an equitable decision.
Opium may be imported free of duty, but can only be sold to the opium farmer or his agents. In the event of no arrangement being effected with them for the sale of the opium, it shall be reexported, and no impost or duty [shall be] levied thereon. Any infringement of this regulation shall subject the opium to seizure and confiscation.
Articles of export, from the time of production to the date of shipment, shall pay one impost only, whether this be levied under the name of inland tax, transit duty, or duty on exportation. The tax or duty to be paid on each article of Siamese produce previous to or upon exportation is specified in the tariff attached to this treaty; and it is distinctly agreed that goods or produce that pay any description of tax in the interior shall be exempted from any further payment of duty on exportation. American merchants are to be allowed to purchase directly from the producer the articles in which they trade, and in like manner to sell their goods directly to the parties wishing to purchase the same without the interference in either case of any other person.
The rates of duty laid down in the tariff attached to this treaty are those that are now paid upon goods or produce shipped in Siamese or Chinese vessels or junks; and it is agreed that American shipping shall enjoy all the privileges now exercised by, or which hereafter may be granted to, Siamese or Chinese vessels or junks.
American citizens will be allowed to build ships in Siam on obtaining permission to do so from the Siamese authorities.
Whenever a scarcity may be apprehended of salt, rice, and fish, the Siamese government reserve to themselves the right of prohibiting by public proclamation the exportation of these articles, giving 30 days, (say thirty days) notice, except in case of war.

Preamble. Treaty.

Whereas the convention heretofore existing between the Creek and Seminole tribes of Indians west of the Mississippi River, has given rise to unhappy and injurious dissensions and controversies among them, which render necessary a re-adjustment of their relations to each other and to the United States; and whereas the United States desire, by providing the Seminóles remaining in Florida with a comfortable home west of the Mississippi River, and by making a liberal and generous provision for their welfare, to induce them to emigrate and become one people with their brethren already west, and also to afford to all the Seminóles the means of education and civilization, and the blessings of a regular civil government ; and whereas, the Creek nation and individuals thereof, have, by their delegation, brought forward and persistently urged various claims against the United States, which it is desirable shall be finally adjusted and settled; and whereas it is necessary for the simplification and better understanding of the relations between the United States and said Creek and Seminole tribes of Indians, that all their subsisting treaty stipulations shall, as far as practicable, be embodied in one comprehensive instrument; now therefore; the United States, by their commissioner, George W.
Manypenny, the Creek tribe of Indians, by their commissioners, Tuck-abatchee-Micco, Echo-Harjo, Chilly McIntosh, Benjamin Marshall, George W. Stidham, and Daniel N. McIntosh; and the Seminole tribe of Indians, by their commissioners, John Jumper, Tuste-nuc-o-chee, Pars-co-fer, and James Factor, do hereby agree and stipulate as follows, viz:

FRANKLIN PIERCE,

PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,

Feb. 5, 1856.

TO ALL AND SINGULAR TO WHOM THESE PRESENTS SHALL COME, GREETING :

Whe rea s a treaty was made and concluded at Stockbridge, in the State of Wisconsin, on the fifth day of February, eighteen hundred and fifty-six, between Francis Huebschmann, commissioner on the part of the United States, and the Stockbridge and Munsee tribes of Indians, assembled in general council, and such of the Munsees as were included in the treaty of September third, eighteen hundred and thirty-nine, but are yet residing in the State of New York, by their duly authorized delegates, William Mohawk and Joshua Willson, which treaty is in the words and figures following, to wit:--
Whereas by Senate amendment to the treaty with the Menomonees of February eighth, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-one, two townships of land on the east side of Winnebago Lake, Territory of Wisconsin, were set aside for the use of the Stockbridge and Munsee tribes of Indians, all formerly of the State of New York, but a part of whom had already removed to Wisconsin ; and
Whereas said Indians took possession of said lands, but dissensions existing among them led to the treaty of September third, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-nine, by which the east half of said two townships was retroceded to the United States, and in conformity to which a part of said Stockbridges and Munsees emigrated west of the Mississippi; and
Whereas to relieve them from dissensions still existing by " An act for the relief of the Stockbridge tribe of Indians in the Territory of Wisconsin," approved March third, one thousand eight hundred and fortythree, it was provided, that the remaining townships of land should be divided into lots and allotted between the individual members of said tribe-; and
Whereas a part of said tribe refused to be governed by the provisions of said act, and a subsequent act was passed on the sixth day of August, one thousand eight hundred and forty-six, repealing the aforementioned act, but without making provision for bona fide purchasers of lots in the townships subdivided in conformity to the said first named act; and
Whereas it was found impracticable to carry into effect the provisions of the last-mentioned act, and to remedy all difficulties, a treaty was entered into on the twenty-fourth of November, one thousand eight hundred and forty-eight, wherein among other provisions, the tribe obligated itself to remove to the country west of the Mississippi set apart for them by the amendment to said treaty ; and
Whereas dissensions have yet been constantly existing amongst them, and many of the tribe refused to remove, when they were offered a location in Minnesota, and applied for a retrocession to them of the township of Stockbridge, which has been refused by the United States ; and
Whereas a majority of the said tribe of Stockbridges and the Munsees are averse to removing to Minnesota and prefer a new location in Wisconsin, and are desirous soon to remove and to resume agricultural pursuits, and gradually to prepare for citizenship, and a number of other members of the said tribe desire at the present time to sever their tribal relations and to receive patents for the lots of land at Stockbridge now occupied by them; and

Whereas the United States are willing to exercise the same liberal policy as heretofore, and for the purpose of relieving these Indians from the complicated difficulties, by which they are surrounded, and to establish comfortably together all such Stockbridges and Munsees--wherever they may be now located, in Wisconsin, in the State of New York, or west of the Mississippi--as were included in the treaty of September third, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-nine, and desire to remain for the present under the paternal care of the United States government; and for the purpose of enabling such individuals of said tribes as are now qualified and desirous to manage their own affairs, to exercise the rights and to perform the duties of the citizen, these articles of agreement have been entered into:
Articles of agreement and convention made and concluded at Stockbridge in the State of Wisconsin, on the fifth day of February, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and fifty-six, between Francis Huebschmann, commissioner on the part of the United States, and the Stockbridge and Munsee tribes of Indians assembled in general council, and such of the Munsees who were included in the treaty of September third, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-nine, but are yet residing in the State of New York, by their duly authorized delegates, William Mohawk and Joshua Willson.
Arti cle I. The Stockbridge and Munsee tribes, who were included in the treaty of September third, one thousand eight hundred and thirtynine, and all the individual members of- said tribes, hereby jointly and severally cede and relinquish to the United States all their remaining right and title in the lands at the town of Stockbridge, State of Wisconsin, the seventy-two sections of land in Minnesota set aside for them by the amendment to the treaty of November twenty-fourth, one thousand eight hundred and forty-eight, the twenty thousand dollars stipulated to be paid to them by the said amendment, the sixteen thousand five hundred dollars invested by the United States in stocks for the benefit of the Stockbridge tribe in conformity to Article IX. of the said treaty, and all claims set up by and for the Stockbridge and Munsee tribes, or by and for the Munsees separately, or by and for any individuals of the Stockbridge tribe who claim to have been deprived of annuities since the year one thousand eight hundred and forty-three, and all such and other claims set up by or for them or any of them are hereby abrogated, and the United States released and discharged therefrom.
Art ic le II. In consideration of such cession and relinquishment by said Stockbridges and Munsees, the United States agree to select as soon as practicable, and to give them a tract of land in the State of Wisconsin, near the southern boundary of the Menomonee reservation, of sufficient extent to provide for each head of a family and others lots of land of eighty and forty acres as hereinafter provided ; every such lot to contain at least one half of arable land, and to pay to be expended for improvements for the said Stockbridges and Munsees, as provided in Article IV., the sum of forty-one thousand one hundred dollars, and a further sum of twenty thousand five hundred and fifty dollars to enable them to r*emove.
Arti cle III. As soon as practicable after the selection of the lands set aside for these Indians by the preceding article, the United States shall cause the same to be surveyed into sections, half and quarter sections, to correspond with the public surveys, and the council of the Stockbridges and Munsees shall under the direction of the Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the northern superintendency, make a fair and just allotment among the individuals and families of their tribes. Each head of a family shall be entitled to eighty acres of land, and in case his or her family consists of more than four members, if thought expedient by the

Art ic le VIII. One hundred and fifty dollars valuation of the schoolhouse at Stockbridge made in conformity to Article VI. of the treaty of November twenty-fourth, one thousand eight hundred and forty-eight, and remaining unpaid, shall be expended in the erection of a school-house, with the other funds set aside for the same purpose by Article IV. of this

embellishing the grounds. Art ic le X. It is agreed that all roads and highways, laid-out by
authority of law shall have right of way through the lands set aside for said Indians, on the same terms as are provided by law for their location through lands of citizens of the United States.
Art ic le XI. The object of this instrument being to advance the welfare and improvement of said Indians, it is agreed, if it prove insufficient, from causes which cannot now be foreseen, to effect these ends, that the President of the United States may, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, adopt such policy in the management of their affairs, as in his judgment may be most beneficial to them ; or Congress may, hereafter, make such provision by law, as experience shall prove to be necessary.
Art ic le XII. The said Stockbridges and Munsees agree to suppress the use of ardent spirits among their people and to resist by all prudent means, its introduction in their settlements.
Art ic le XIII. The Secretary of the Interior, if deemed by him expedient and proper, may examine into the sales made by the Stockbridge Indians, to whom lots of land were allotted in conformity to the act of Congress, entitled " An act for the relief of the Stockbridge tribe of Indians in the Territory of Wisconsin," approved March third, one thousand eight hundred and forty-three ; and if it shall be found that any of the said sales have been improperly made, or that a proper consideration has not been paid, the same may be disapproved or set aside. By the direction of the said Secretary, patents to such lots of land shall be issued to such persons as shall be found to be entitled to the same.
Art ic le XIV. The lots of land, the equitable title to which shall be found not to have passed by valid sales from the Stockbridge Indians to purchasers, and such lots as have, by the treaty of November twentyfourth, one thousand eight hundred and forty-eight, been receded to the United States, shall be sold at the minimum price of ten dollars per acre for lots fronting on Lake Winnebago, on both sides of the military road, and all the lands in the three tiers of lots next to Lake Winnebago, and at five dollars per acre for the residue of the lands in said township of Stockbridge. Purchasers of lots, on which improvements were made by Stockbridge Indians, shall pay, in addition to the said minimum price, the appraised value of such improvements. To actual settlers on any of said lots possessing the qualifications requisite to acquire preemption rights, or being civilized persons of Indian descent, not members of any tribe, who shall

TREATY WITH THE STOCKBRIDGES AND MUNSEES. Feb . 1856. 667

prove, to the satisfaction of the register of the land district, to which the township of Stockbridge shall be attached, that he or she has made improvements to the value of not less than fifty dollars on such lot, and that he or she is actually residing on it; the time of paying the purchase price may be extended for a term not exceeding three years from the ratification hereof, as shall be deemed advisable by the President of the United States, provided, that no such actual settler shall be permitted to preempt, in the manner aforesaid, more than one lot, or two contiguous lots, on which he has proved to have made improvements exceeding the value of one hundred dollars. The residue of said lots shall be brought into market as other government lands are offered for sale, and shall not be sold at a less price than the said minimum price ; and all said sales shall be made, and the patents provided for in these articles shall be issued in accordance with the survey made in conformity to said act of March third, one thousand eight hundred and forty-three, unless, in the opinion of the Secretary of the Interior, a new survey shall be deemed necessary and proper.
Art ic le XV. The United States agree to pay, within one year after the ratification of this agreement, the appraised value of the improvements upon the lands herein ceded and relinquished to the United States, to the individuals claiming the same, the valuation of such improvements, to be made by a person to be selected by the Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the northern superintendency, and not to exceed, in the aggregate, the sum of five thousand dollars.
Art ic le XVI. The hereinafter named Stockbridge Indians, having become sufficiently advanced in civilization, and being desirous of separating from the Stockbridge tribe, and of enjoying the privileges granted to persons of Indian descent by the State of Wisconsin, and in consideration of ceding and relinquishing to the United States all their rights in the lands and annuities of the Stockbridge tribe of Indians, and in the annuities, money, or land, to which said Indians now are or may hereafter be entitled, the United States agree to issue patents in fee simple to the said Stockbridge Indians to the lots of land, at the town of Stockbridge, described and set opposite their names.

Depa rt men t of th e Inte ri or ,

Office Indian Affairs, March 3, 1856.

Letter of Geo. W. Manypenny, Indian Commissioner.

Sir : Referring to my last two annual reports, where the embarrassed condition of the Stockbridge and Munsee Indians is discussed, and to the paragraph of the general Indian appropriation bill, of the 3d March, 1855, Stat, at Large, vol. x, p. 699, where there is appropriated, "For the purpose of enabling the President to treat with, and arrange the difficulties existing among the Stockbridge and Munsee Indians, of Lake Winnebago, in the State of Wisconsin, arising out of the acts of Congress of third March, eighteen hundred and forty-three, and August sixth, eighteen hundred and forty-six, and the treaty of twenty-fourth of November, eighteen hundred and forty-eight, in such manner as may be just to the Indians, and with their assent, and not inconsistent with the legal rights of white persons who may reside on the Stockbridge reserve, of the claim of the United States under the treaty of eighteen hundred and forty-eight, the sum of fifteen hundred dollars ; " and also to the treaty which was made between these Indians and Superintendent Francis Huebschmann, during the last summer, which, for reasons then given you, was disapproved of, I have now the honor to send up a treaty concluded with them, on the 5th ultimo, by Superintendent Huebschmann, the provisions of which are approved by me, and would recommend, if you agree, that it be laid before the President, to the end, if approved by him, that it may be sent to the Senate for its constitutional action thereon.
And I herewith transmit a copy of the letter of the superintendent sending on said treaty, together with a copy of a power of attorney from certain Munsees to Isaac Durkee, William Mohawk, and Joshua "Willson, for purposes therein indicated.
I would merely remark that, by locating the Stockbridges in Wisconsin, instead of Minnesota, about $20,000 of expense would be saved in removal, while a location in Minnesota could not be more out of the way of the whites, and the lands there would be worth to the government at least as much as the price to be paid the Menomonees.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
GEO. W. MANYPENNY", Commissioner. Hon. Rob er t Mc Cle ll an d ,
Secretary of the Interior.

TREATY WITH THE STOCKBRIDGES AND MUNSEES. Feb . 1856. 673

Nor th ern Supe rin ten de nc y ,

Milwaukie, February 23, 1856.

Sir : I have the honor to enclose a treaty with the Stockbridges and
Munsees, concluded in conformity to your instructions. In consequence
of the complicated difficulties at Stockbridge, and the factious spirit ruling among the Indians, the task imposed upon me was not an easy one, and required extraordinary patience and forbearance. I believe I have used all proper means to make the arrangement contemplated by the treaty as acceptable to all parties interested as could be expected under the circumstances. However, about one fifth of the Indians, headed by Austin E. Quinney, and mostly consisting of members of the Quinney family, did not sign the treaty, but without giving any sensible reason. The only two objections raised by Austin E. Quinney to the draft of the treaty were: First, That the issuing of patents to lands, to be apportioned to the individuals of the tribe, was contemplated. This objection was virtually obviated by amending the treaty, so that the application for a patent to be made after ten years, has first to be consented to by the general council of the Stockbridges and Munsees.
His second objection was, that there was no provision made for the payment of a claim he himself has against the tribe. Though I invited him to submit the claim to me for examination, he did not do so, and, from what I learned from himself and others, it appears that it would, if submitted, not bear very accurate examination, as about half of it is made up of high charges for meals furnished councillors of the Stockbridges, and the other half for funds advanced to one certain Chandler, on his share of the twenty thousand dollars, to be paid under the amendment to the treaty of 1848, for procuring the adoption of the said amendment.
The real objection on the part of the Quinneys to the reorganization of the Stockbridges and Munsees under this treaty, is, no doubt, the certainty staring them in the face, that their rule over the tribe will be at an end if the treaty is ratified. To show what use this family has made of their power over the tribe, I will only mention a few instances. Though claiming to hold their lands again in commonalty in consequence of the law of August 6, 1846, Austin E. Quinney, by barter and trade carried on with widows and other Indians, and by advancing to them a few provisions, pretended to have bought their lots of land, and, under the treaty of 1848, he not only received pay for the improvements on all these lands, (1,440 acres,) $2,760.63, but of the sixteen thousand five hundred dollars paid under V. article of treaty of 1848, he received $3,083, while under a proper per capita apportionment, the share of his family would not have been much more than about three hundred dollars. The interest of the $16,500, to be paid "as other annuities are paid by the United States," has been apportioned in direct violation of the said treaty until the Stockbridge affairs came under my superintendence, in the same manner as the $16,500, under art. V. had been paid ; and for the benefit of Sam'l Miller, even that illegal apportionment was falsified so as to pay him one half of $1,662.50, and the interest on the other half instead of $412.50, the pro-
portion to which he would have been entitled by the quantity of land held by him at the treaty of 1848. Austin E. Quinney realized about a thousand dollars more by selling his pretended right of occupancy to lots, so that it appears, that he has received about seven thousand dollars in addition to what he has received of the money paid to his tribe by the State of New York, and it is no doubt mortifying to him that his share of moneys hereafter, is to be no larger than that of any other member of the tribe. A great part of the funds received from the State of New York has been used by the Quinney family for their own aggrandizement and the sending of delegations to Washington; and the wishes of a

674 TREATY WITH THE STOCKBRIDGES AND MUNSEES. Feb . 1856.
majority of the Stockbridges in relation to the application of those funds, have been frequently disregarded, and at the present time Sam'l Miller has been sent by Austin E. Quinney as delegate to Washington with a part of those funds, in direct opposition to the wishes of the majority.
I proposed to Austin E. Quinney and his followers to patent to them lands at Stockbridge, and to make other stipulations favorable to them, if they preferred to remain there and to separate from the tribe ; but as they would not declare their willingness to accept of such provisions, and as Quinney declared that he would probably desire to remove with the others if the lands to be selected were of good quality, and deeming it more beneficial to them, that they should remove with the others and be settled bv themselves, if they preferred it, in some corner of the new reservation, I did not feel prompted to provide for their remaining at Stockbridge, and increased the sums to be paid in proportion to their number.
I had made no secret, since my visit to Stockbridge during the forepart of December last, of the arrangement contemplated in relation to lands and land-titles at Stockbridge, (articles XIII. and XIV.,) and it appeared generally satisfactory to white settlers ; yet there will be always found meddlesome individuals, and it appears that, at the request of a resident of Stockbridge, who, however, has no land himself, a lawyer of Green Bay had drawn up a petition or memorial asking the treaty to be amended.
When I saw the document, no names were attached to it, and I have not inquired afterwards, if it has been signed by anybody and forwarded. I read it very hastily; but it left the impression upon my mind that little legal knowledge was displayed by its author. Since the authority to issue patents, given by the law of 1843, was destroyed by the repealing act of 1846, and the list of patents to lots to be granted under the treaty of 1848, is imperfect and incorrect, the settlers at Stockbridge, if they understand it, will be the last to object to authority being granted to the proper officer, to issue patents; and the investigation of sales made by Indians provided for, I think, will not be seriously objected to, except by such who are afraid that the consideration paid by them would be found to
have consisted of whiskey. The minimum price fixed in the treaty for the land, to be sold by the
United States government, is not too high nor unjust to any class of the settlers at Stockbridge. Those who settled there shortly after the treaty of 1848, and bought out, for a small consideration, the right of occupancy of Indians, to their houses, clearings, and fields, have since mostly confined themselves to cultivating the fields already made and raised fine crops, without paying any taxes or bearing any of the hardships of a new settlement. It has not been so much by their labor that these lands have become valuable, as by the settlements and improvements made in the surrounding country and the general prosperity of the State. The settlers who have recently squatted on lots of land at Stockbridge, have gone there with the perfect knowledge of the price which was expected to be fixed on those lands, and since it has become known that the treaty was signed, that part of the State has been under great excitement, and many have flocked to Stockbridge to make claims and to avail themselves of the privileges contemplated to be extended to actual settlers by the treaty. It is feared that there are even more settlers and claimants than lots of land, and if the price should be reduced, the excitement would, no doubt, become more intense, and the land officers would find it more difficult to settle the conflicting claims. The privilege of entering lands at the terms of payment, as prescribed for actual settlers, in ART. XIV., granted to a number of Indians by ART. XVI., was considered by all as very valuable, which seems to prove beyond a doubt, that the price is considered very moderate. If the petition above referred to has been signed generally by the settlers at Stockbridge, they have done so in consequence of its being represented to them, that it could do no harm to try to get the lands from the government at a less price, and not because the price is too high

" Beginning in the Gulf of Mexico, three leagues from land, opposite the mouth of the Rio Grande, as provided in the fifth article of the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo; thence, as defined in the said article, up the middle of that river to the point where the parallel of 31° 47' north latitude crosses the same; thence due west one hundred miles; thence south to the parallel of 31° 20' north latitude; thence along the said parallel of 31° 20' to the 111th meridian of longitude west of Greenwich; thence in a straight line to a point on the Colorado River twenty English miles below the junction of the Gila and Colorado rivers; thence up the middle of the said River Colorado until it intersects the present line between the United States and Mexico: "

No. 42. Respecting Disturbances in Kansas Territory. BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

Feb. 11, 1856.

A PROCLAMATION.

Wher eas indications exist that public tranquillity and the supremacy of law in the Territory of Kansas, are endangered by the reprehensible acts or purposes of persons, both within and without the same, who propose to direct and control its political organization by force : It appearing that combinations have been formed therein to resist the execution of the Territorial laws, and thus, in effect, subvert by violence all present constitutional and legal authority: It also appearing that persons residing without the Territory, but near its borders, contemplate armed intervention in the affairs thereof: It also appearing that other persons, inhabitants of remote states, are collecting money, engaging men, and providing arms for the same purpose: And it further appearing that combinations within the Territory are endeavoring, by the agency of emissaries and otherwise, to induce individual States of the Union to intervene in the affairs thereof, in violation of the Constitution of the United States:
And whereas all such plans for the determination of the future institutions of the Territory, if carried into action from within the same, will constitute the fact of insurrection, and if from without, that of invasive aggression, and will, in either case, justify and require the forcible interposition of the whole power of the General Government, as well to maintain the laws of the Territory as those of the Union :
Now, therefore, I, FRANKLIN PIERCE, President of the United States, do issue this my proclamation to command all persons engaged in unlawful combinations against the constituted authority of the Territory of Kansas or of the United States, to disperse and retire peaceably to their respective abodes; and to warn all such persons that any attempted insurrection in said Territory, or aggressive intrusion into the same, will be resisted not only by the employment of the local militia, but also by that of any available forces of the United States ; to the end of assuring immunity from violence and full protection to the persons, property, and civil rights of all peaceful and law-abiding inhabitants of the Territory.
If, in any part of the Union, the fury of faction or fanaticism, inflamed into disregard of the great principles of popular sovereignty, which, under the Constitution, are fundamental in the whole' structure of our institutions, is to bring on the country the dire calamity of an arbitrament of arms in that Territory, it shall be between lawless violence on the one side, and conservative force on the other, wielded by legal authority of the General Government.
I call on the citizens, both of adjoining and of distant States, to abstain from unauthorized intermeddling in the local concerns of the Territory, admonishing them that its organic law is to be executed with impartial justice; that all individual acts of illegal interference will incur condign punishment; and that any endeavor to intervene by organized force will be firmly withstood.
I invoke all good citizens to promote order by rendering obedience to the law; to seek remedy for temporary evils by peaceful means; to discountenance and repulse the counsels and the instigations of agitators and of disorganizers; and to testify their attachment to their country, their pride in its greatness, their appreciation of the blessings they enjoy, and their determination that republican institutions shall not fail in their hands, by co-operating, to uphold the majesty of the laws and to vindicate the sanctity of the Constitution.
In testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the
United States to be affixed to these presents.

Whe re as pursuant to the first article of the treaty between the United States and the Mexican Republic, of the thirtieth day of December, one thousand eight hundred and fifty-three, the true limits between the territories of the contracting parties were declared to be as follows :
" Retaining the same dividing line between the two Californias as already defined and established, according to the fifth article of the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, the limits between the two republics shall be as follows:
" Beginning in the Gulf of Mexico, three leagues from land, opposite the mouth of the Rio Grande, as provided in the fifth article of the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo; thence, as defined in the said article, up the middle of that river to the point where the parallel of 31° 47' north latitude crosses the same; thence due west one hundred miles; thence south to the parallel of 31° 20' north latitude; thence along the said parallel of 31° 20' to the 111th meridian of longitude west of Greenwich; thence in a straight line to a point on the Colorado River twenty English miles below the junction of the Gila and Colorado rivers; thence up the middle of the said River Colorado until it intersects the present line between the United States and Mexico: "
And whereas, the said dividing line has been surveyed, marked out, and established, by the respective commissioners of the contracting parties, pursuant to the same article of the said treaty:
Now, therefore, be it known, that I, FRANKLIN PIERCE, President of the United States of America, do hereby declare to all whom it may concern, that the line aforesaid shall be held and considered as the boundary between the United States and the Mexican Republic, and shall be respected as such by the United States and the citizens thereof.
