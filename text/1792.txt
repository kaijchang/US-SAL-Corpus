(a) Robbing the mail of the United States. The defendant was indicted on the 24th section of the act of Congress, ofMarch 3, 1825, entitled "An act to reduce into one the several acts establishing and regulating the Post-office department," for advising, procuring, and assisting one Joseph J. Straughan, a mail carrier, to rob the mail of the United States, and was found guilty. Upon this finding the judges of the Circuit Court of South Carolina were divided in opinion upon the question, whether an indictment founded on the statute for advising, &c., a mail carrier to rob the mail, ought to set forth and aver that the said carrier did commit the offence of robbing the mail. By the Supreme Court: the answer to this as an abstract proposition, must be in the affirmative, but if the question intended to be put, is, whether there must be a distinct substantive averment of the fact, it is not necessary. United States v. Mills, 7 Peters, 138.
Upon an indictment for robbing the mail, and putting the person in custody of it in jeopardy, under the 19th section of the act of April 30, 1810, a sword, &c., in the hand of the robber, by terror of which the robbery is effected, is a dangerous weapon within the act, putting the life in jeopardy, though it be not drawn, or pointed at the carrier. So a pistol in his hands, by means of which the robbery is effected, is a dangerous weapon ; and it is not necessary to prove that it was charged: it is presumed to be so until the contrary is proved. United States v. Wood, 3 Wash. C. C. R. 440.
It is not necessary to a conviction under the 22d section, that the carrier of the mail should have taken the oath prescribed by the 2d section of the act of 1825, or that the whole mail be taken. The United States v. Wilson, 1 Baldwin's C. C. R. 102.
The word " rob," in the act of Congress of 1825, section 22, is used in the common law sense. Ibid.
" Jeopardy," as used in the section, means a well grounded apprehension of danger to life, in case of refusal to yield to threats, or resistance. Ibid.

Cha p. XXIV.--An Act concerning Consuls and Vice-Consuls.
For carrying into full effect the convention between the King of the French, and the United States of America, entered into for the purpose of defining and establishing the functions and privileges of their respective Consuls and Vice-Consuls;
Sec ti on 1. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That where in the seventh article of the said convention, it is agreed that when there shall be no consul or vice-consul of the King of the French, to attend to the saving of the wreck of any French vessels stranded on the coasts of the United States, or that the residence of the said consul, or viceconsul (he not being at the place of the wreck) shall be more distant from the said place than that of the competent judge of the country, the latter shall immediately proceed to perform the office therein prescribed; the district judge of the United States of the district in which the wreck shall happen, shall proceed therein, according to the tenor of the said article. And in such cases it shall be the duty of the officers of the customs within whose districts such wrecks shall happen, to give notice thereof, as soon as may be, to the said judge, and to aid and assist him to perform the duties hereby assigned to him. The district judges of the United States shall also, within their respective districts be the competent judges, for the purposes expressed in the ninth article of the said convention, and it shall be incumbent on them to give aid to the consuls and vice-consuls of the King of the French, in arresting and securing deserters from vessels of the French nation according to the tenor of the said article.
And where by any article of the said convention, the consuls and vice-consuls of the King of the French, are entitled to the aid of the competent executive officers of the country, in the execution of any precept, the marshals of the United States and their deputies shall, within their respective districts, be the competent officers, and shall give their aid according to the tenor of the stipulations.
And whenever commitments to the jails of the country shall become necessary in pursuance of any stipulation of the said convention, they shall be to such jails within the respective districts as other commitments under the authority of the United States are by law made.

(a) Act of July 6, 1797, chap. 12 ; act of February 28, 1803, chap. 9 ; act of February 28, 1811, chap. 28 ; act of March 3, 1813, chap. 42, sec. 6. 1810, ch. 39.
The decisions of the courts of the United States upon the powers, duties, and obligations of consuls, have been:
A foreign consul has a right to claim or institute a proceeding in rem where the rights of property of his fellow-citizens are in question, without a special procuration from those for whose benefit he acts. The Bello Corrunnes, 6 Wheat. 152 ; 5 Cond. Rep. 45.
A consul cannot receive actual restitution of the res in controversy, without a special authority. To watch over the rights and interests of their subjects, wherever the pursuits of commerce may draw them, or the vicissitudes of human affairs may force them, are the great objects for which consuls are deputed by their sovereigns. Ibid.
As an abstract question, it is difficult to understand on what ground a state can claim jurisdiction of civil suits against consuls. By the constitution, the judicial power of the courts of the United States, extends to all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls, exclusive of the courts of the several states, and the judiciary act gives the district courts jurisdiction of ail suits against consuls and vice consuls, except for certain offences enumerated in the act. Davis v. Packard, 7 Peters, 276.
Consuls are subject to indictment for misdemeanor in the courts of the United States. United States v. Ravara, 2 Dall. 297.
A consul is not personally answerable for a contract made in his official capacity on account of his government. Jones v. Le Tombe, 3 Dall. 384.
The advice of an American consul in a foreign port, gives to the master of a vessel no justification for an illegal act. Wilson v. The Mary, Gilpin's D. C. R. 31.
A consul's certificate of any fact is not evidence between third persons, unless expressly or impliedly made so by statute. Levy v. Burley, 2 Sumner's C. C. R. 355.
Under the consular act of 1803, the penalty of 500 dollars for not depositing the ship's register with the consul, on arrival at a foreign port, must be sued for within two years, the limitation prescribed by the act of 1790; it not being a revenue law within the meaning of the act of 1804. Parsons v. Hunter, 2 Summer's C. C. R. 419.

It shall be their duty where the laws of the country permit, to take possession of the personal estate left by any citizen of the United States, other than seamen belonging to any ship or vessel who shall die within their consulate; leaving there no legal representative, partner in trade or trustee by him appointed to take care of his effects, they shall inventory the same with the assistance of two merchants of the United States, or for want of them, of any others at their choice; shall collect the debts due to the deceased in the country where he died, and pay the debts due from his estate which he shall have there contracted; shall sell at auction after reasonable public notice such part of the estate as shall be of a perishable nature and such further part, if any, as shall be necessary for the payment of his debts, and at the expiration of one year from his decease, the residue; and the balance of the estate they shall transmit to the treasury of the United States, to be holden in trust for the legal claimants. But if at any time before such transmission, the legal representative of the deceased shall appear and demand his effects in their hands, they shall deliver them up, being paid their fees, and shall cease
their proceedings. For the information of the representative of the deceased, it shall be
the duty of the consul or vice-consul authorized to proceed as aforesaid in the settlement of his estate, immediately to notify his death in one of the gazettes published in the consulate, and also to the Secretary of State, that the same may be notified in the state to which the deceased shall belong; and he shall also, as soon as may be, transmit to the Secretary of State, an inventory of the effects of the deceased taken as
before directed. Sec . 3. And be it further enacted, That the said consuls and vice-
consuls, in cases where ships or vessels of the United States shall be stranded on the coasts of their consulates respectively, shall, as far as the laws of the country will permit, take proper measures, as well for the purpose of saving the said ships or vessels, their cargoes and appurtenances, as for storing and securing the effects and merchandise saved, and for taking an inventory or inventories thereof; and the merchandise and effects saved with the inventory or inventories thereof taken as aforesaid, shall, after deducting therefrom the expense, be delivered to the owner or owners. Provided, That no consul or vice-consul shall have authority to take possession of any such goods, wares, merchandise or other property, when the master, owner or consignee thereof is present or capable of taking possession of the same.
Sec . 4. And be it further enacted, That it shall and may be lawful for every consul and vice-consul of the United States, to take and receive the following fees of office for the services which he shall have per-
formed. For authenticating under the consular seal, every protest, declaration,
deposition, or other act, which such captains, masters, mariners, seamen, passengers, merchants or others as are citizens of the United States
may respectively choose to make, the sum of two dollars.

And be it enacted and declared, That if the principal, in any bond which shall be given to the United States, for duties on goods, wares, and merchandise imported, shall be insolvent, or if such principal being dead, his or her estate and effects, which shall have come to the hands of his or her executors or administrators, shall be insufficient for the payment of his or her debts, and if, in either of the said cases, any surety in the said bond, or the executors and administrators of such surety, shall pay to the United States the monies thereupon due, such surety, his or her executors or administrators, shall have and enjoy the like advantage, priority and preference, for the recovery and receipt of the said monies out of the estate and effects of such insolvent or deceased principal, as are reserved and secured to the United States, by the forty-fourth section of the act, intituled " An act to provide more effectually for the collection of duties imposed by law on goods, wares, and merchandise imported into the United States, and on the tonnage of ships or vessels," and shall and may bring and maintain a suit upon the said bond, in law or equity, in his, her or their own name or names, for the recovery of the monies which shall have been paid thereupon. And it is further declared, That the cases of insolvency in the said forty-fourth section mentioned, shall be deemed to extend, as well to cases in which a debtor, not having sufficient property to pay all his or her debts, shall have made a voluntary assignment thereof, for the benefit of his or her creditors, or in which the estate and effects of an absconding, concealed or absent debtor shall have been attached by process of law, as to cases, in which an act of legal bankruptcy shall have been committed.

(a) Priority of the United States. In all cases of insolvency or bankruptcy of a debtor of the United States, they are entitled to payment out of his effects. The United States v. Fisher et al. 2 Cranch 358; 1 Cond. Rep. 421.
The United States have no lien on the estate of their debtor, until suit brought, or a notorious insolvency or bankruptcy has taken place; or, being unable to pay all his debts, he has made a voluntary assignment of all his property; or the debtor having absconded, concealed, or absented himself, his property has been attached by process of law. United States v. Hoe et al., 3 Cranch, 73; 1 Cond. Rep. 458.
The 5th section of the act of March 3, 1797, giving a priority of payment to the United States out of the effects of their debtors, did not apply to a debt due before the passing of the act, although the balance was not adjusted at the treasury until after the act was passed'. United States v. Bryan et al., 9 Cranch, 374; 3 Cond. Rep. 436.
In case of insolvency the United States are not entitled to a priority of payment, unless the insolvency be a legal and known insolvency, manifested by some notorious act of the debtor, pursuant to the act of Congress. Prince v. Bartlett, 8 Cranch, 431 ; 3 Cond. Rep. 199.
The United States are not entitled to a priority over all creditors, under the 65th section of the act of March 2, 1799, upon the ground of the debtor having made an assignment for the benefit of his creditors, unless it is proved that it is all the debtor's property. United States v. Howland et al., 4 Wheat. 108 ; 4 Cond. Rep. 404.
The priority of the United States does not attach by the mere concealment of the debtor when insolvent. Ibid.
It has never been decided by the Supreme Court, that the priority of the United States will divest a specific lien attached to anything, whether it be accompanied by possession or not. Conard v. The Atlantic Ins. Comp., 1 Peters, 439.
The priority of the United States extends as well to debts by bonds which are payable after insolvency or decease of the obligor, as to those actually due or payable at the period thereof. The United States v. The State Bank of North Carolina, 6 Peters, 29.
The priority of the United States for debts due to them by an insolvent debtor, or by the estate of a deceased debtor, does not extend to affect the lien of an incorporated bank on the stock held by one indebted to the bank, when by the charter of the bank such a lien is given. Brent v. The Bank of Washington, 10 Peters, 596.

Sec . 9. And be it further enacted, That it shall be the duty of the clerk of the supreme court of the United States, forthwith to transmit to the clerks of the several circuit courts the form of a writ of error, to be approved by any two of the judges of the supreme court, and it shall be lawful for the clerks of the said circuit courts to issue writs of error agreeably to such forms, as nearly as the case may admit, under the seal of the said circuit courts, returnable to the supreme court, in the same manner as the clerk of the supreme court may issue such writs, in pursuance of the act, intitled " An act to establish the judicial courts of the United States."
Sec . 10. And be it further enacted, That it shall and may be lawful for the clerks of the district and circuit courts, in the absence or in case of the disability of the judges, to take recognizances of special bail, de bene esse, in any action depending in either of the said courts, and also the affidavits of all surveyors relative to their reports, and to administer oaths to all persons identifying papers found on board of vessels or elsewhere, to be used on trials in admiralty causes.
Sec . 11. And be it further enacted, That in all suits and actions in

(a) Costs are not to be awarded against the United States. The United States v. Hoe et al., 3 Cranch 73 ; 1 Cond. Rep. 458. The Antelope, 12 Wheat. 546 ; 6 Cond. Rep. 629.
Where there appeared some ground for the prosecution, costs were refused. The United States v. La Vengeance, 3 Dall. 297; 1 Cond. Rep. 132.
It is undoubtedly a general rule that no court can give a direct judgment against the United States in a suit to which they are a party, either in behalf of any suitor, or any officer of the government. But it by no means follows that they are not liable for their own costs. No direct suit can be maintained against the United States. But when an action is brought by the United States, to recover money in the hands of a party, who has a legal claim against them for costs, it would be a very rigid principle to deny to him the right of setting up such claim in a court of justice, and turn him round to an application to Congress. If the right of the party is fixed by the existing law, there can be no necessity for an application to Congress, except for the purpose of remedy. And no such necessity can exist, where the right can be properly set up by way of defence to a suit by the United States. The United States v. Pvinggold et al., 8 Peters, 150.
If a witness recognized for the defendant, is marked on the indictment and sent to the grand jury by the district attorney, the United States on the acquittal of the prisoner, must pay the witness his costs. The United States v. Coulter, Circuit Court of Pennsylvania, April, 1803.

STATUTE II.
Cha pte r I.--An Act concerning the registering and recording of ships or Dec. 31, 1792. vessels, (a)
Sec ti on 1. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives What ships or of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That ships or vessels shall be
(a) The decisions of the courts of the United States on the acts relating to the registering of ships and vessels, have been:
An American registered vessel, in part transferred by grant while at sea, to an American citizen, and re-sold to her original owners on her return into port before her entry, does not, by that operation, lose her privilege as an American bottom, nor become subject to foreign duties. The United States v. Willings and Francis, 4 Cranch, 48 ; 2 Cond. Rep. 20.
In case of alienation to a foreigner, the privileges of an American bottom are ipso facto forfeited; but in case of alienation to a citizen, they are not forfeited until after she ought to have been registered anew ; and the oath which entitles her owner to enter as an American bottom, does not require such new register. Ibid.
The register is the only document which needs be on board during a period of universal peace, in compliance with the warranty of national character. Catlett v. The Pacific Ins. Comp., Paine's C. C. R. 594.
If one of two partners in a house of trade in the United States, obtain a register for a vessel as a vessel of the United States, by swearing that he, together with his partner of the city of New York, are the sole owners of the vessel, when, in fact, his partner is domicilled in England, the vessel is liable to forfeiture under the act of December 31, 1792. The Venus, 8 Cranch, 253 ; 3 Cond. Rep. 109.
A transfer of a vessel of the United States to a foreign subject in a foreign port, for the purpose of evading the revenue laws of a foreign country with an understanding that she is to be afterwards re-conveyed to the former owner, works a forfeiture of the vessel under the 18th section of the registering act of December 31, 1792, unless the transfer is made known in the manner prescribed by the 7th section of the act. The Margaret, 9 Wheat. 421; 5 Cond. Rep. 638.
The proviso in the 16th section of the registry act, being by way of exception from the enacting clause, need not be taken notice of in a libel filed to enforce a forfeiture. The proviso applies only to the case of a part owner. Ibid.
By the law of the United States relating to the registry and enrolling of vessels, the inaccurate recital of the certificate of registry on a bill of sale does not, as in England, avoid the sale ; but merely deprives the vessel of her American character. Phillips v. Ledley, 1 Wash. C. C. R. 226.
If a registered vessel is assigned to a foreigner, she is only deprived of her American character. The sale of a licensed vessel to a foreigner is not void, but the vessel is liable to forfeiture. Ibid.
Under the act of Congress of December 31, 1792, which declares, that "if a false oath be taken to procure a register for a vessel, the vessel, or its value, shall be forfeited," the United States have an election to proceed against the vessel as forfeited, or against the person who took the false oath, for its value. But until that election is made, the property does not vest in the United States, and the United States cannot maintain an action for money had and received against the assignees of the person who took the oath, and who became bankrupt; the assignees having sold the vessel and recovered the purchase money before the seizure of the vessel. The United States v. Grundy et al., 3 Cranch, 337; 1 Cond. Rep. 554.
Under the 27th section of the registry act of 1792, vessels which have not been previously registered, as well as those which have been previously registered, may be forfeited by a fraudulent use of the certificate of register. The Neptune, 3 Wheat. 601 ; 4 Cond. Rep. 351.
A citizen of the United States, resident in a foreign country, may, under the act of December 31, 1792, command a registered vessel of the United States, without her right to the payment of domestic duties being affected thereby : but under the same act he cannot be the owner of a vessel of the United States. United States v. Gillies, Peters's C. C. R. 159.
By the licensing act of February IS, 1793, no coaster can be sold in a foreign port, unless her license

Sec . 2. And be it further enacted, That ships or vessels built within the United States, whether before or after, the fourth of July, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-six, and belonging wholly to a citizen or citizens thereof, or not built within the said states, but on the sixteenth day of May, in the year one thousand seven hundred and eightynine, belonging and thenceforth continuing to belong to a citizen or citizens thereof, and ships or vessels which may hereafter be captured in war, by such citizen or citizens, and lawfully condemned as prize, or which have been, or may be adjudged to be forfeited for a breach of the laws of the United States, being wholly owned by a citizen or citizens thereof, and no other, may be registered as herein after directed : Provided, That no such ship or vessel shall be entitled to be so registered, or if registered, to the benefits thereof, if owned in whole, or in part, by any citizen of the United States, who usually resides in a foreign country, during the continuance of such residence, unless such citizen be in the capacity of a consul of the United States, or an agent for, and a partner in, some house of trade or co-partnership, consisting of citizens of the said states actually carrying on trade within the said states: And provided further, That no ship or vessel, built within the United States, prior to the said sixteenth day of May, which was not then owned wholly, or in part, by a citizen or citizens of the United States, shall be capable of being registered, by virtue of any transfer to a citizen or citizens, which may hereafter be made, unless by way of prize or forfeiture : Provided nevertheless, That this shall not be construed to prevent the registering anew, of any ship or vessel, which was before registered, pursuant to the act before mentioned.
Sec . 3. And be it further enacted, That every ship or vessel, hereafter to be registered (except as is herein after provided) shall be registered by the collector of the district in which shall be comprehended the port to which such ship or vessel shall belong, at the time of her registry, which port shall be deemed to be that, at or nearest to which, the owner, if there be but one, or if more than one, the husband or acting and managing owner of such ship or vessel, usually resides. And the name of the said ship or vessel, and of the port to which she shall so belong, shall be painted on her stern, on a black ground, in white letters, of not less than three inches in length. And if any ship or vessel of the United States, shall be found, without having her name, and the name of the port, to which she belongs, painted in manner aforesaid, the owner or owners shall forfeit fifty dollars; one half to the person

be previously surrendered, nor is her American character changed by such transfer. But if she be condemned for a violation of that law, and sold under an order of court, she may become foreign property. United States v. The Hawke, Bee's Adm. Rep. 34. See also the United States v. The Brig Burdett, 9 Peters, 682.
By the act of 1793, no registered ship or vessel can, while she remains registered, engage in the whale fisheries, but she must surrender her register, and be enrolled and licensed for the fisheries. The United
States v. Rogers, 3 Sumner's C. C. R. 342. By the arrival of a vessel sailing under a temporary register at her home port, within the meaning of
the 3d section of the coasting act of 1793, is meant an arrival in the regular course of an employment, at one of the termini of her voyage, or for an object connected with, and making part of, the business in which she is engaged. United States v. Shackford, Ware's D. C. R. 171.

in war by a citizen or citizens of the said states, and lawfully condemned

as prize (producing a copy of the sentence of condemnation, authenti-

cated in the usual forms) or that she has been adjudged to be forfeited

for a breach of the laws of the United States, (producing a like copy

of the sentence whereby she shall have been so adjudged) and declaring

his or her name and place of abode, and if he or she be the sole owner

of the said ship or vessel that such is the case; or if there be another

owner or other owners, that there is or are such other owner or

And if such oath or affirmation shall not be taken, subscribed and transmitted, as is herein required, the certificate of registry, granted to such ship or vessel, shall be forfeit and void.
Sec . 6. And be it further enacted, That before any ship or vessel shall be registered, she shall be measured by a surveyor, if there be one, or by the person he shall appoint, at the port or place where the said ship or vessel may be, and if there be none, by such person as the collector of the district, within which she may be, shall appoint, according to the rule prescribed by the forty-third section of the act, intituled "An act to provide more effectually, for the collection of the duties imposed by law on goods, wares and merchandise, imported into the United States, and on the tonnage of ships or vessels." And the officer, or person, by whom such admeasurement shall be made, shall, for the information of, and as a voucher to the officer by whom the registry is to be made, grant a certificate, specifying the built of such ship or vessel, her number of decks and masts, her length, breadth, depth, the number of tons she measures, and such other particulars as are usually descriptive of the identity of a ship or vessel; and that her name, and the place to which she belongs, are painted on her stern, in manner required by the third section of this act: which certificate shall be countersigned by an owner, or by the master of such ship or vessel, or by some other person who shall attend her admeasurement, on behalf of her owner or owners, in testimony of the truth of the particulars therein contained; without which, the said certificate shall not be valid. But in all cases, where a ship or vessel has before been registered, as a ship or vessel of the United States, it shall not be necessary to measure her anew, for the purpose of obtaining another register ; except such ship or vessel shall have undergone some alteration, as to her burthen, subsequent to the time of her
former registry. Sec . 7. And be it further enacted, That, previous to the registry of

lector of the said district. Sec . 8. And be it further enacted, That in order to the registry of
any ship or vessel, which, after the last day of March next, shall be built within the United States, it shall be necessary to produce a certificate, under the hand of the principal or master carpenter, by whom, or under whose direction, the said ship or vessel shall have been built, testifying, that she was built by him, or under his direction, and specifying the place where, the time when, and the person or persons for whom, and describing her built, number of decks and masts, length, breadth, depth, tonnage, and such other circumstances, as are usually descriptive of the identity of a ship or vessel; which certificate shall be sufficient to authorize the removal of a new vessel, from the district where she may be built, to another district in the same, or an adjoining state, where the owner or owners actually reside, provided it be with ballast only.
Sec . 9. And be it further enacted, That the several matters herein before required, having been complied with, in order to the registering of any ship or vessel, the collector of the district comprehending the port to which she shall belong, shall make, and keep, in some proper book, a record or registry thereof, and shall grant an abstract or certificate of such record or registry, as nearly as may be, in the form fol-
