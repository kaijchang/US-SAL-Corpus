The International Association of the Congo, hereby declares that by treaties with the legitimate sovereigns in the basins of the Congo and of the Niadi-Kialun, and in adjacent territories upon the Atlantic, there has been ceded to it territory for the use and benefit of free States established under the care and supervision of the said Association in the said basins and adjacent territories, to which cession the said free States of right succeed.
That the said International Association has adopted for itself and for the said free States, as their standard, the flag of the International African Association, being a blue flag with a golden star iu the centre.
That the said Association and the said States have resolved to levy no custom-house duties upon goods or articles of merchandise imported into their territories or brought by the route which has been constructed around the Congo cataracts; this they have done with a view of enabling commerce to penetrate into Equatorial Africa.
That they guarantee to foreigners settling in their territories the right to purchase, sell or lease, lands and buildings situated therein, to establish commercial houses and to there carry on trade upon the sole condition that they shall obey the laws. They pledge themselves, moreover, never to grant to the citizens of one nation any advantages without immediately extending the same to the citizens of all other nations, and to do all in their power to prevent the slave-trade.
In testimony whereof, Henry S. Sanford, duly empowered therefor, by the said Association, acting for itself and for the said Free States, has hereunto set his hand and affixed his seal, this 22d day of April, 1884, in the city of Washington.
