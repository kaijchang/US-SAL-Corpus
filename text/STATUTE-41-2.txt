A PROCLAMATION.

THE

Boy

Scouts

of America

have

rendered

notable

service

to

the

Boy Scouts of Amer. ica.

Nation during the world war. They have done effective work in the Preamble.

Liberty Loan and War Savings campaigns , in discovering and report-

ing upon the black walnut supply, in cooperating with the Red Cross

and other war work agencies, in acting as despatch bearers for the

Committee on Public Information , and in other important fields .

The Boy Scouts have not only demonstrated their worth to the Nation, but have also materially contributed to a deeper appreciation

by the American people of the higher conceptions of patriotism and good citizenship .

The Boy Scout movement should not only be preserved, but

strengthened. It deserves the support of all public-spirited citizens .

The available means for the Boy Scout movement have thus far

sufficed for the organization and training of only a small proportion

of the boys of the country. There are approximately 10,000,000

boys in the United States , between the ages of twelve and twenty-one.

Of these only 375,000 are enrolled as members of the Boy Scouts of America .

1748

PROCLAMATIONS , 1919.

America cannot acquit herself commensurately with her power and influence in the great period now facing her and the world unless the boys of America are given better opportunities than heretofore to prepare themselves for the responsibilities of citizenship.
Every nation depends for its future upon the proper training and development of its youth. The American boy must have the best training and disciplíne our great democracy can provide if America is to maintain her ideals, her standards , and her influence in the world.

The plan, therefore, for a Boy Scout week during which a universal

appeal will be made to all Americans to supply the means to put the

Boy Scouts of America in a position to carry forward effectively and

continuously the splendid work they are doing for the youth of Åmer-

ica, should have the unreserved support of the Nation . Observance recommended of June 8th Therefore, I , Woodrow Wilson, President of the United States of
to June 14th as Boy America, do hereby recommend that the period beginning Sunday, Scout Week.
June 8th, to Flag Day, June 14th, be observed as Boy Scout Week

through the United States for the purpose of strengthening the work

of the Boy Scouts of America.

Cooperation of com-

munities, etc.

I earnestly recommend that, in every community, a Citizens'

Committee, under the leadership of a National Citizens' Committee,

be organized to cooperate in carrying out a program for a definite

recognition of the effective services rendered by the Boy Scouts of

America ; for a survey of the facts relating to the boyhood of each

community, in order that with the cooperation of churches, schools

and other organizations definitely engaged in work for boys , adequate

provision may be made for extending the Boy Scout program to a

larger proportion of American boyhood.

Enrollment of asso-

ciate members, etc.

The Boy Scout movement offers unusual opportunity for volunteer

service. It needs men to act as committeemen and as leaders of

groups of boys . I hope that all who can will enlist for such personal

service, enroll as associate members and give all possible financial

assistance to this worthy organization of American boyhood. Anything that is done to increase the effectiveness of the Boy Scouts of

America will be a genuine contribution to the welfare of the Nation .

In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.

A PROCLAMATION.

The Season of the year has again arrived when the people of the 19T1h9.anksgiving Day, United States are accustomed to unite in giving thanks to Almighty Preamble. God for the blessings which He has conferred upon our country during the twelve months that have passed. A year ago our people poured out their hearts in praise and thanksgiving that through divine aid the right was victorious and peace had come to the nations which had so courageously struggled in defense of human liberty and justice. Now that the stern task is ended and the fruits of achievement are ours, we look forward with confidence to the dawn of an era where the sacrifices of the nations will find recompense in a world at
peace. But to attain the consummation of the great work to which the
American people devoted their manhood and the vast resources of their country they should, as they give thanks to God, reconsecrate themselves to those principles of right which triumphed through His merciful goodness. Our gratitude can find no more perfect expression than to bulwark with loyalty and patriotism those principles for
which the free peoples of the earth fought and died. During the past year we have had much to make us grateful. In
spite of the confusion in our economic life resulting from the war we have prospered. Our harvests have been plentiful, and of our abundance we have been able to render succor to less favored nations.
Our democracy remains unshaken in a world torn with political and social unrest. Our traditional ideals are still our guides in the path ofprogress and civilization.
These great blessings, vouchsafed to us, for which we devoutly give thanks, should arouse us to a fuller sense of our duty to our-

our example and by our cooperation in realizing the enduring welfare

of all peoples and in bringing into being a world ruled by friendship

and good will.

The sole purpose of the census is to secure general statistical information regarding the population and resources of the country and

Census Bureau is prohibited, under heavy penalty, from disclosing any information which may thus come to his knowledge.

My Fellow-Countrymen :

Landing of the Pilgrims, 1620.

December 21 next will mark the Tercentenary of the landing of the

Ante, p. 508.

Pilgrims at Plymouth in 1620. The day will be becomingly cele-

brated at Plymouth under the auspices of the Plymouth Pilgrim Tercentenary Commission , and at other localities in Massachusetts .

While this is proper and praiseworthy , it seems to me that the influences which the ideals and principles of the Pilgrims with respect

to civil liberty and human rights have had upon the formation and growth of our institutions and upon our development and progress as a nation merit more than a local expression of our obligation , and

make fitting a nation-wide observance of the day. Recommending December 21, 1920, be ob- I therefore suggest and request that the 21st of December next be

tseernvaerdy oafs. the Tercen- observed throughout the Union with special patriotic services in order that the great events in American history that have resulted

from the landing of these hardy and courageous navigators and

colonists may be accentuated to the present generation of American

citizens . Especially do I recommend that the day be fittingly observed in the universities , colleges, and schools of our country to

the end that salutary and patriotic lessons may be drawn from the fortitude and perseverance and the ideals of this little band of sturdy men and women who established on this continent the first self-

determined government based on the great principle of just law and its equal application to all , and thus planted the seed from which has sprung a mighty nation.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed .

WHEREAS , the destruction by fires in the United States involves

an annual loss of life of 15,000 men , women and children , and over

$250,000,000 in buildings , food stuffs and other created resources , and

Whereas, the need of the civilized world for American products to
replace the ravages of the great war is especially great at this time, and

Whereas , the present serious shortage of home and business struc-

tures makes the daily destruction of buildings by fire an especially

serious matter, and

Whereas, a large percentage of the fires causing the annual American

fire waste may be easily prevented by increased care and vigilance

on the part of citizens :

A PROCLAMATION

The season again approaches when it behooves us to turn from ,19T2h0.anksgiving Day, the distractions and preoccupations of our daily life, that we may Preamble. contemplate the mercies which have been vouchsafed to us, and render
heartfelt and unfeigned thanks unto God for His manifold goodness.
This is an old observance of the American people, deeply imbedded in our thought and habit. The burdens and the stresses of life have their own insistence.

We have abundant cause for thanksgiving . The lesions of the

war are rapidly healing. The great army of freemen , which America sent to the defense of Liberty, returning to the grateful embrace of the nation, has resumed the useful pursuits of peace, as simply and

as promptly as it rushed to arms in obedience to the country's call. The equal justice of our laws has received steady vindication in the support of a law-abiding people against various and sinister attacks , which have reflected only the baser agitations of war, now happily

passing. In plenty, security and peace, our virtuous and self-reliant people
face the future, its duties and its opportunities . May we have vision to discern our duties ; the strength, both of hand and resolve, to discharge them; and the soundness of heart to realize that the truest opportunities are those of service.
In a spirit, then, of devotion and stewardship we should give thanks in our hearts, and dedicate ourselves to the service of God's

merciful and loving purposes to His children . Wherefore, I, Woodrow Wilson , President of the United States of beTrh2u5r, s1d92a0y,,apNpoovinetme-d
America, do hereby designate Thursday, the twenty-fifth day of as a day of general November next as a day of Thanksgiving and prayer, and I call thanksgiving. upon my countrymen to cease from their ordinary tasks and avoca-

tions upon that day, giving it up to the remembrance of God and His blessings, and their dutiful and grateful acknowledgment.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
