IN publishing the following Laws, the same plan has been adopted that was prescribed in the Joint Resolution of Congress of March 3, 1845, authorizing a subscrip. tion to the edition of all the Laws of the United States published by us. A close examination of this volume will disclose some apparent errors in the Laws as here printed ; but as we procure a careful collation with the records at Washington by an experienced reader of the Department of State, and scrupulously follow the original, any seeming errors must be attributed to the Rolls, and not to us. Where anything absolutely necessary to the sense is omitted in the Rolls, it is inserted in the text, enclosed in brackets.

We intend to publish annually, and as soon after the close of each Session of Congress as is possible, the Acts of that Session, in a similar form and with a similar arrangement.

It will be seen, by the following extract from the Act of Congress, August 8th, 1846, and Joint Resolution of September 26, 1850, that our edition has been sanctioned by Congress, and is the OFFICIAL EDITION.
"And whereas said edition of the said LAWS AND TREATIES OF THE UNITED STATES has been carefully collated and compared with the original Rolls in the Archives of the Government, under the inspection and supervision of the AttorneyGeneral of the United States, as duly certified by that officer : therefore, Be it further enacted, that said edition of the LAWS AND TREATIES OF THE UNITED STATES, published by LITTLE & BROWN, is hereby declared to be competent evidence of the several Public and Private Acts of Congress, and of the several Treaties therein contained, in all the Courts of Law and Equity and Maritime Jurisdiction, and in all the Tribunals and Public Offices of the United States and of the several States, without any further proof or authentication thereof. APPROVED, August 8, 1846."
"Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the Secretary of State be authorized and directed to contract with LITTLE & BROWN to furnish their annual Statutes at Large, printed in conformity with the plan adopted by Congress in eighteen hundred and forty-five, instead of the edition usually issued by his order, under the act of Congress of April twentieth, eighteen hundred and eighteen, and which conforms to an edition of the laws now out of use. APPROVED, September 26, 1850."

Measure the depth at each point of division from a point at a distance of one third of the round of the beam below such deck, or, in case of a

break, below a line stretched in continuation thereof, to the upper side of

the floor-timber, at the inside of the limber-strake, after deducting the

average thickness of the ceiling, which is between the bilge-planks and

limber-strake ; then, if the depth at the midship division of the length do

not exceed sixteen feet, divide each depth into four equal parts ; then

measure the inside horizontal breadth, at each of the three points of divis-

fifth ; multiply the quantity thus obtained by one third of the common interval between the breadths, and the product shall be deemed the transverse area ; but if the midship depth exceed sixteen feet, divide each
depth into six equal parts, instead of four, and measure, as before directed, the horizontal breadths at the five points of division, and also at the upper and lower points of the depth ; number them from above as before ;
multiply the second, fourth, and sixth, by four, and the third and fifth by two ; add these products together, and to the sum add the first breadth and the last, or seventh ; multiply the quantities thus obtained by one third of the common interval between the breadths, and the product shall be deemed the transverse area.
Having thus ascertained the transverse area at each point of division Register tonof the length of the vessel, as required above, proceed to ascertain the taaignee,dh; ow ascer register tonnage of the vessel in the following manner : -
Number the areas successively one, two, three, & c., number one being at the extreme limit of the length at the bow, and the last number at the extreme limit of the length at the stern ; then whether the length be divided according to table, into six or sixteen parts, as in classes one and six, or any intermediate number, as in classes two, three, four, and five, multiply the second, and every even-numbered area, by four, and the third and every odd-numbered area (except the first and last) by two ; add these products together, and to the sum add the first and last, if they yield anything ; multiply the quantities thus obtained by one third of the common interval between the areas, and the product will be the cubical contents of the space under the tonnage-deck ; divide this product by one hundred, and the quotient, being the tonnage under the tonnage-deck, shall be deemed to be the register tonnage of the vessel, subject to the additions hereinafter mentioned.
when there is If there be a break, a poop, or any other permanent closed-in space on the upper decks, on the spar-deck, available for cargo, or stores, or for oanbrueppaek,roorrpsopaorp-, the berthing or accommodation of passengers or crew, the tonnage of such deck ; space shall be ascertained as follows : -
Measure the internal mean length of such space in feet, and divide it into an even number of equal parts of which the distance asunder shall
be most nearly equal to those into which the length of the tonnage-deck has been divided ; measure at the middle of its height the inside breadths, namely, one at each end and at each of the points of division, numbering them successively one, two, three, &c.; then to the sum of the end breadths add four times the sum of the even-numbered breadths and
twice the sum of the odd-numbered breadths, except the first and last, and multiply the whole sum by one third of the common interval between the breadths ; the product will give the mean horizontal area of such space ; then measure the mean height between the planks of the decks, and multi-
ply by it the mean horizontal area ; divide the product by one hundred, and the quotient shall be deemed to be the tonnage of such space, and shall be added to the tonnage under the tonnage-decks, ascertained as aforesaid.
If a vessel has a third deck, or spar-deck, the tonnage of the space when there is a third deck.
between it and the tonnage-deck shall be ascertained as follows : Measure in feet the inside length of the space, at the middle of its
height, from the plank at the side of the stem, to the plank on the timbers at the stern, and divide the length into the same number of equal parts into which the length of the tonnage-deck is divided ; measure (also at

the mean horizontal area of such space ; measure the mean height between the plank of the two decks, and multiply by it the mean horizontal area, and the product will be the cubical contents of the space ; divide this product by one hundred, and the quotient shall be deemed to be the tonnage of such space, and shall be added to the other tonnage of the vessel, ascertained as aforesaid. And if the vessel has more than three

decks, the tonnage of each space between decks, above the tonnage-deck, shall be severally ascertained in the manner above described, and shall be added to the tonnage of the vessel, ascertained as aforesaid.

further duty in respect to them ; and if such articles should not be
sold for consumption in the Ottoman Empire, but should be reëxported within the space of six months, the same shall be consid-

An exception to the stipulations laid down in the fifth article shall be made in regard to tobacco in any shape whatsoever, and also in regard to salt, which two articles shall cease to be included among those which the citizens of the United States of America are permitted to import into the Ottoman dominions.
Citizens of the United States, however, or their agents, buying or selling tobacco or salt for consumption in the Ottoman Empire, shall be subject to the same regulations and shall pay the same duties as the most favored Ottoman subjects trading in the two articles aforesaid ; and furthermore, as a com-
pensation for the prohibition of the two articles above mentioned , no
duty whatsoever shall in future be levied on those articles when ex-
ported from the Ottoman Empire by citizens of the United States.
Citizens of the United States shall, nevertheless, be bound to de-

No. 4. May 8, 1863. BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA :

A PROCLAMATION.

Preamble.

WHEREAS, The congress of the United States at its last session enacted a

1863, ch. 75. law entitled " An act for enrolling and calling out the national forces, and for

Vol. xii. p. 731. other purposes," which was approved on the 3d day of March last ; and Whereas, It is recited in the said act that there now exists in the United

States an insurrection and rebellion against the authority thereof, and it is, under the Constitution of the United States, the duty of the government to suppress

insurrection and rebellion , to guarantee to each state a republican form of government, and to preserve the public tranquillity; and

Whereas, For these high purposes a military force is indispensable, to raise and support which all persons ought willingly to contribute ; and
Whereas, No service can be more praiseworthy and honorable than that which is rendered for the maintenance of the Constitution and Union, and the conse-

quent preservation of free government ; and Whereas, For the reasons thus recited, it was enacted by the said statute that
all able-bodied male citizens of the United States and persons of foreign birth who shall have declared on oath their intention to become citizens under and

in pursuance of the laws thereof, between the ages of twenty and forty-five years, (with certain exceptions not necessary to be here mentioned ,) are declared to constitute the national forces, and shall be liable to perform military

duty in the service of the United States, when called out by the President for

that purpose ; and Whereas, It is claimed by and in behalf of persons of foreign birth within the
ages specified in said act who have heretofore declared on oath their intentions

to become citizens under and in pursuance of the laws of the United States, and who have not exercised the right of suffrage or any other political franchise under the laws of the United States, or of any of the states thereof, that they are not absolutely concluded by their aforesaid declaration of intention from re-

nouncing their purpose to become citizens, and that, on the contrary, such persons under treaties or the law of nations retain a right to renounce that purpose and to forego the privileges of citizenship and residence within the United States under the obligations imposed by the aforesaid act of congress :

Plea of alienage Now, therefore, to avoid all misapprehensions concerning the liability of per-
not to be allowed sons concerned to perform the service required by such enactment, and to give to exempt, &c.
it full effect, I do hereby order and proclaim that no plea of alienage will be re-
ceived or allowed to exempt from the obligations imposed by the aforesaid act
of congress, any person of foreign birth who shall have declared on oath his in-

tention to become a citizen of the United States under the laws thereof, and who

shall be found within the United States at any time during the continuance of

the present insurrection and rebellion, at or after the expiration of the period of sixty-five days from the date of this Proclamation, nor shall any such plea of alienage be allowed in favor of any such person who has so, as aforesaid, declared his intention to become a citizen of the United States, and shall have exercised

at any time the right of suffrage, or any other political franchise, within the United States, under the laws thereof, or under the laws of any of the several states.
In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.

was existing on the third day of March, 1863, which rebellion is still existing ;

and whereas, by a statute which was approved on that day, it was enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States, in congress

assembled, that during the present insurrection, the President of the United

States, whenever in his judgment the public safety may require it, is authorized

to suspend the privilege ofthe writ of habeas corpus in any case throughout the

United States, or any part thereof ; and whereas, in the judgment of the Presi-

dent, the public safety does require that the privilege of the said writ shall now be suspended throughout the United States in the cases where, by the authority

of the President of the United States, military, naval, and civil officers of the

United States, or any of them, hold persons under their command or in their

custody, either as prisoners of war, spies, or aiders or abettors of the enemy, or officers, soldiers, or seamen enrolled or drafted or mustered or enlisted in, or

belonging to, the land or naval forces of the United States, or as deserters there-

from, or otherwise amenable to military law, or the rules and articles of war, or

the rules or regulations prescribed for the military or naval services by authority of the President of the United States, or for resisting a draft, or for any other

offence against the military or naval service :

A PROCLAMATION.
THE year that is drawing toward its close has been filled with the blessings Day of thanksof fruitful fields and healthful skies. To these bounties, which are so constantly giving and praise enjoyed that we are prone to forget the source from which they come, others set apart. have been added, which are of so extraordinary a nature that they cannot fail to penetrate and soften the heart which is habitually insensible to the everwatchful providence of Almighty God.
In the midst of a civil war of unequalled magnitude and severity, which has sometimes seemed to foreign states to invite and provoke their aggressions, peace has been preserved with all nations, order has been maintained, the laws have been respected and obeyed, and harmony has prevailed everywhere,

except in the theatre of military conflict ; while that theatre has been greatly contracted by the advancing armies and navies of the Union.
Needful diversions of wealth and of strength from the fields of peaceful industry to the national defence have not arrested the plough, the shuttle, or the ship ; the axe has enlarged the borders of our settlements, and the mines, as well of iron and coal as of the precious metals, have yielded even more abundantly than heretofore. Population has steadily increased, notwithstanding the waste that has been made in the camp, the siege, and the battle-field , and the country, rejoicing in the consciousness of augmented strength and vigor, is permitted to expect continuance of years with large increase of freedom.
No human counsel hath devised, nor hath any mortal hand worked out these great things. They are the gracious gifts of the Most High God, who, while dealing with us in anger for our sins, hath nevertheless remembered mercy.
It has seemed to me fit and proper that they should be solemnly, reverently, and gratefully acknowledged as with one heart and one voice by the whole American people. I do, therefore, invite my fellow-citizens in every part of the United States, and also those who are at sea and those who are sojourning in foreign lands, to set apart and observe the last Thursday of November next as a Day of Thanksgiving and Praise to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the heavens. And I recommend to them that, while offering up the ascriptions justly due to Him for such singular deliverances and blessings, they do also, with humble penitence for our national perverseness and disobedience, commend to His tender care all those who have become widows, orphans, mourners, or sufferers, in the lamentable civil strife in which we are
unavoidably engaged, and fervently implore the interposition of the Almighty hand to heal the wounds of the nation, and to restore it, as soon as may be con-
sistent with the Divine purposes, to the full enjoyment of peace, harmony, tranquillity, and union.
In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
