affirmation hereinafter expressed, administered to him by the judge of

the district court of the United States, within whose jurisdiction the

debtor may be confined; and in case there shall be no district judge

residing within twenty miles of the gaol wherein such debtor may be

confined, such oath or affirmation may be administered by any two per-

sons who may be commissioned for that purpose by the district judge:

The creditor, his agent or attorney, if either live within one hundred

miles of the place of imprisonment, or within the district in which the

judgment was rendered, having had at least thirty days previous notice

by a citation served on him, issued by the district judge, to appear at

the time and place therein mentioned, if he see fit to show cause why

the said oath or affirmation should not be so administered: At which

time and place, if no sufficient cause, in the opinion of the judge, (or

the commissioners appointed as aforesaid) be shown, or doth from ex-

amination appear to the contrary, he or they may, at the request of the

debtor, proceed to administer to him the following oath or affirmation,

as the case may be, viz. "You

solemnly (swear or affirm)

that you have no estate, real or personal, in possession, reversion or re-

mainder, to the amount or value of thirty dollars, other than necessary

wearing apparel; and that you have not, directly or indirectly, given,

sold, leased, or otherwise conveyed to, or intrusted any person or per-

sons with all or any part of the estate, real or personal, whereof you

have been the lawful owner or possessor, with any intent to secure the

same, or to receive or expect any profit or advantage therefrom, or to

defraud your creditors, or have caused or suffered to be done any thing

else whatsoever, whereby any of your creditors may be defrauded."

Which oath or affirmation being administered, the judge or commis-

sioners shall certify the same under his or their hands to the prison-

keeper, and the debtor shall be discharged from his imprisonment on

such judgment, and shall not be liable to be imprisoned again for the

said debt, but the judgment shall remain good and sufficient in law, and

may be satisfied out of any estate which may then, or at any time after-

wards, belong to the debtor. And the judge or commissioners, in addi-

tion to the certificate by them made and delivered to the prison-keeper,

shall make return of their doings to the district court, with the commis-

sion, in cases where a commission hath been issued, to be kept upon

the files and record of the same court. And the said judge, or com-

Sec ti on 1. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That when any

(a) Salvage on recapture. Salvage is a compensation for actual services rendered in saving the property charged with it; and it is demandable of right for vessels saved from the enemy, or from pirates. There must be meritorious services, and the taking must be lawful. Talbot v. Seaman, 1 Cranch, 1; 1 Cond. Rep. 229.
On the recapture of a vessel by a neutral vessel, no claim for salvage can arise, for the recapture Was a hostile act, not justified by the situation of the nation to which the recapturing vessel belongs, in relation to that from the possession of which the recaptured vessel was taken. The degree of service rendered in such a case, is precisely the same as if it had been rendered by a belligerent; yet the rights accruing from the recapture are different, because no right can accrue from an act which was unlawful.
Ibid. American property recaptured was restored on payment of salvage; the libel having prayed the con 
demnation as prize, and no salvage having been claimed. The question of salvage is incident to the question of prize. The Adeline, 9 Cranch, 244; 3 Cond. Rep. 397.
In order to entitle to salvage, as upon a recapture or rescue, the property must have been in possession of the enemy, either actual or constructive. The Ann Green, 1 Gallis. C. C. R. 274.
Salvage is not due for "rescuing a vessel of a neutral out of the hands of a belligerent, who has taken possession for a supposed violation of a treaty or the law of nations." The Antelope, Bee's D. C.
R. 233. An American vessel was captured by an enemy, and after condemnation and sale to an enemy, was
recaptured by an American privateer. The original owner claimed the vessel, offering to allow salvage. Held : that it was not a case for salvage, under the act of March 3, 1800, or the act of June 26, 1812. The property had become completely divested by the capture and condemnation.

(a) Decisions on the Bankrupt Law of the United States.--The holder of a promissory note, drawn before, but transferred after a commission of bankruptcy had issued against the drawer, is entitled to prove his debt under the commission, and to receive a dividend. Humphreys v. Blight's Assignees, 4Dall. 370.

In the case of negotiable paper, the assignee takes it, discharged of all the equity as between the original parties, of which he had no notice. But wherever the assignee has notice of such equity, either positively or constructively, he takes the assignment at his peril. A commission of bankruptcy is legal notice that wherever mutual debts subsisted between the bankrupt and his creditors, the right of set-off attaches. When the negotiable paper was assigned after the commission of bankruptcy, the party takes it, subject to any set-off as between the drawer and payee. Ibid.
Under the bankrupt law of the United States, a joint debt may be set-off against the separate claim

of the assignee of one of the partners; but such set-off could not have been made at law, independent ot the bankrupt law. Tucker v. Oxley, 5 Cranch, 34 ; 2 Cond. Rep. 182.

A joint debt may be proved under a separate commission, and a full dividend received; it is equity alone which can restrain the joint creditor from receiving his full dividend until the joint effects are exhausted. Ibid.

Wherever the terms in which a power is granted by the constitution to Congress, or wherever the nature of the power itself, requires that it shall be exclusively exercised by Congress, the subject is completely taken away from state legislatures, as if they had been forbidden to act upon it. The power granted to Congress of establishing uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcy, is not of this description. Sturges v. Crowninshield, 4 Wheat. 122 ; 4 Cond. Rep. 409,

In the distribution of a bankrupt's effects in this country, the United States are entitled to a preference, although the debt was contracted by a foreigner in a foreign country; and although the United States had proved their debt under the commission of bankruptcy, and had voted for an assignee. Harrison v. Sterry et al., 5 Cranch, 289; 2 Cond. Rep. 260.

A conveyance on the eve of bankruptcy, to give a preference to a particular class of creditors is a fraud on the bankrupt law and void. Ibid.

Such assignment may be valid to secure money actually advanced on the credit of it, and subsequent

to its date. Ibid.

Under a separate commission of bankruptcy, against one partner only, his private property, and his interest in the funds of the company passes. Ibid.

The right to compensation from Spain, held under an abandonment made to underwriters, and accepted by them, for damages and injuries, which were to be satisfied under the treaty, by the United States; passed to the assignees of the bankrupt, who held such rights by the provisions of the bankrupt law of the United States, passed April 4, 1800. Comegys et al. v. Vasse, 1 Peters, 193.

The circuit courts of the United States have jurisdiction of matters arising under the bankrupt law of the United States, as they have of any other subject, where the constitution and laws of the United States give jurisdiction; but the district courts have not the same jurisdiction in cases of bankruptcy as the chancellor of England has. Lucas et al. v. Morris et al., 1 Paine's C. C. R. 396.

The district courts of the United States have not, like the chancellor in England, exclusive jurisdiction over the entire execution of the bankrupt law. They cannot remove assignees, nor compel them to account. Ibid.

Upon the death of an assignee under the bankrupt law of the United States, the right of action for a debt due to the bankrupt, vested in the executor of the assignee. Richards et al. Assignees, &c. v. Maryland Ins. Co., 8 Cranch, 84; 3 Cond. Rep. 45.

Where the original ground of action is founded on contract, but the immediate cause arises ex delicto, and the claim is for damages, unliquidated by any express agreement, or such as the law will not imply an agreement to pay; the certificate of bankruptcy is no bar; because such claim could not have been proved under the commission. Dusar v. Murgatroyd, 1 Wash. C. C. R. 13.

Sec ti on 1. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That when any

(a) Salvage on recapture. Salvage is a compensation for actual services rendered in saving the property charged with it; and it is demandable of right for vessels saved from the enemy, or from pirates. There must be meritorious services, and the taking must be lawful. Talbot v. Seaman, 1 Cranch, 1; 1 Cond. Rep. 229.
On the recapture of a vessel by a neutral vessel, no claim for salvage can arise, for the recapture Was a hostile act, not justified by the situation of the nation to which the recapturing vessel belongs, in relation to that from the possession of which the recaptured vessel was taken. The degree of service rendered in such a case, is precisely the same as if it had been rendered by a belligerent; yet the rights accruing from the recapture are different, because no right can accrue from an act which was unlawful.
Ibid. American property recaptured was restored on payment of salvage; the libel having prayed the con 
demnation as prize, and no salvage having been claimed. The question of salvage is incident to the question of prize. The Adeline, 9 Cranch, 244; 3 Cond. Rep. 397.
In order to entitle to salvage, as upon a recapture or rescue, the property must have been in possession of the enemy, either actual or constructive. The Ann Green, 1 Gallis. C. C. R. 274.
Salvage is not due for "rescuing a vessel of a neutral out of the hands of a belligerent, who has taken possession for a supposed violation of a treaty or the law of nations." The Antelope, Bee's D. C.
R. 233. An American vessel was captured by an enemy, and after condemnation and sale to an enemy, was
recaptured by an American privateer. The original owner claimed the vessel, offering to allow salvage. Held : that it was not a case for salvage, under the act of March 3, 1800, or the act of June 26, 1812. The property had become completely divested by the capture and condemnation.

of the United States, or under authority, or pretence of authority from

any prince, government or state, against which the United States have

authorized, or shall authorize, defence or reprisals, such public vessel

not having been condemned as prize by competent authority before the

recapture thereof, the same shall be restored to the United States. And

for and in lieu of salvage, there shall be paid from the treasury of the

United States, pursuant to the final decree which shall be made in such

case by any court of the United States, having competent jurisdiction

thereof, to the parties who shall be thereby entitled to receive the same,

for the recapture as aforesaid, of an unarmed vessel, or any goods

therein, one sixth part of the true value thereof, when made by a private

vessel of the United States, and one twelfth part of such value when the

recapture shall be made by a public armed vessel of the United States;

and for the recapture as aforesaid of a public armed vessel, or any goods

therein, one moiety of the true value thereof, when made by a private

vessel of the United States, and one fourth part of such value, when

such recapture shall be made by a public armed vessel of the United

States.

enemy of the United States, or by authority or pretence of authority

from any prince, government or state, against which the United States

have authorized, or shall authorize, defence or reprisals, then such ves-

(a) Decisions on the Bankrupt Law of the United States.--The holder of a promissory note, drawn before, but transferred after a commission of bankruptcy had issued against the drawer, is entitled to prove his debt under the commission, and to receive a dividend. Humphreys v. Blight's Assignees, 4Dall. 370.

In the case of negotiable paper, the assignee takes it, discharged of all the equity as between the original parties, of which he had no notice. But wherever the assignee has notice of such equity, either positively or constructively, he takes the assignment at his peril. A commission of bankruptcy is legal notice that wherever mutual debts subsisted between the bankrupt and his creditors, the right of set-off attaches. When the negotiable paper was assigned after the commission of bankruptcy, the party takes it, subject to any set-off as between the drawer and payee. Ibid.
Under the bankrupt law of the United States, a joint debt may be set-off against the separate claim

of the assignee of one of the partners; but such set-off could not have been made at law, independent ot the bankrupt law. Tucker v. Oxley, 5 Cranch, 34 ; 2 Cond. Rep. 182.

A joint debt may be proved under a separate commission, and a full dividend received; it is equity alone which can restrain the joint creditor from receiving his full dividend until the joint effects are exhausted. Ibid.

Wherever the terms in which a power is granted by the constitution to Congress, or wherever the nature of the power itself, requires that it shall be exclusively exercised by Congress, the subject is completely taken away from state legislatures, as if they had been forbidden to act upon it. The power granted to Congress of establishing uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcy, is not of this description. Sturges v. Crowninshield, 4 Wheat. 122 ; 4 Cond. Rep. 409,

In the distribution of a bankrupt's effects in this country, the United States are entitled to a preference, although the debt was contracted by a foreigner in a foreign country; and although the United States had proved their debt under the commission of bankruptcy, and had voted for an assignee. Harrison v. Sterry et al., 5 Cranch, 289; 2 Cond. Rep. 260.

A conveyance on the eve of bankruptcy, to give a preference to a particular class of creditors is a fraud on the bankrupt law and void. Ibid.

Such assignment may be valid to secure money actually advanced on the credit of it, and subsequent

to its date. Ibid.

1

Under a separate commission of bankruptcy, against one partner only, his private property, and his interest in the funds of the company passes. Ibid.

The right to compensation from Spain, held under an abandonment made to underwriters, and accepted by them, for damages and injuries, which were to be satisfied under the treaty, by the United States; passed to the assignees of the bankrupt, who held such rights by the provisions of the bankrupt law of the United States, passed April 4, 1800.

The circuit courts of the United States have jurisdiction of matters arising under the bankrupt law of the United States, as they have of any other subject, where the constitution and laws of the United States give jurisdiction; but the district courts have not the same jurisdiction in cases of bankruptcy as the chancellor of England has. Lucas et al. v. Morris et al., 1 Paine's C. C. R. 396.

The district courts of the United States have not, like the chancellor in England, exclusive jurisdiction over the entire execution of the bankrupt law. They cannot remove assignees, nor compel them to account. Ibid.

Upon the death of an assignee under the bankrupt law of the United States, the right of action for a debt due to the bankrupt, vested in the executor of the assignee. Richards et al. Assignees, &c. v. Maryland Ins. Co., 8 Cranch, 84; 3 Cond. Rep. 45.

Where the original ground of action is founded on contract, but the immediate cause arises ex delicto, and the claim is for damages, unliquidated by any express agreement, or such as the law will not imply an agreement to pay; the certificate of bankruptcy is no bar; because such claim could not have been proved under the commission. Dusar v. Murgatroyd, 1 Wash. C. C. R. 13.

and after the first day of June next, if any merchant, or other person, residing within the United States, actually using the trade of merchan-

But if the agreement were to pay a particular sum, on failure to perform the contract; or if the case was such that the plaintiff has his election to bring either trespass or case for money had and received, and waives the former by bringing the latter; the damages become a debt, which the law implies a promise to pay, and the certificate be a bar. Ibid.
In an action brought against the owner of u vessel for damages for an injury sustained on board a ship by the neglect of the master, a certificate of bankruptcy cannot be pleaded in bar. Ibid.
One guilty of perjury in proceedings under the bankrupt law, cannot be prosecuted for the offence, after the repeal of the law. United States v. Passmore, 4 Dall. 372.
A deed executed before the 1st of June, 1800, although acknowledged after, is not within the 1st section of the bankrupt act of April 4th, 1800, chap. 19. Wood v- Owings, 1 Cranch, 239; 1 Cond. Rep. 302.
A certificated bankrupt or insolvent, discharged from the particular contract, need not be made a party to the bill on the contract. Van Reimsdyke v. Kane's Ex'r, 1 Gall. C. C. R. 371.
The power given to Congress to pass uniform laws, relative to bankruptcy, is exclusive of such power in the state governments ; and this, whether the former has thought proper to exercise it or not. Golden v. Prince, 3 Wash. C. C. R. 313.
A discharge from a debt under the bankrupt laws of the place of contract, is good in every other place where pleaded, as an extinguishment of the debt. But a like discharge where the contract is not made, has no effect. Le Roy v. Crowninshield, 2 Mason's C. C. R. 151.
A debtor concealing himself from, and being denied to his creditors, does not constitute an act of bankruptcy under the laws of the United States; unless the service of process is thereby prevented. Barnes et al. v. Billington, 1 Wash. C. C. R. 29.
If the debtor order himself to be denied to creditors and others, and is in consequence thereof denied to an officer, who comes to serve a process, it is an act of bankruptcy ; provided the officer comes to serve the process, and not on other business : and the denial has taken place within six months of the issuing of the commission. Ibid.
Giving a bond, with warrant to confess judgment to one creditor, upon the eve and in contemplation of bankruptcy, does not constitute a bankruptcy; unless the judgment entered on the bond, and the issuing of the execution was at the instance or by the procurement of the debtor. Such a bond would be a fraud on the general creditors. Ibid.
Where two of three assignees of a bankrupt enter into an agreement in the absence of the third, the contract is not binding on the absent assignee; unless he had previously given authority to make it, or substantially recognize and acknowledge it. Aliter, among partners. Blight v. Ashley et al., 1 Peters' C. C. R. 16.
The agreement of the assignees of a bankrupt, to give a preference to a particular creditor, is not valid, without the assent of the commissioners, and a certain portion of the creditors. Ibid.
Denial to an officer, whereby he is prevented serving process, must be really adversary, and not by concert between the creditor and the debtor, to bring about an act of bankruptcy. Ibid.
No debt but such as is due and owing at the time of the bankruptcy, can be proved under the commission ; and, consequently, an endorser or acceptor of a bill of exchange, drawn by the bankrupt, who has not paid it before the bankruptcy, cannot prove the debt. Marks et al. Assignees v. Barker et al., 1 Wash. C. C. R. 178.
The acceptor or endorser of a bill of exchange, who pays the bill after the bankruptcy of the drawer, may offset the same against-the bankrupt's assignees; but he must show the debt to be a subsisting one in him, at the time the action was brought, for this is a case of mutual credit, given before the bankruptcy, although the money was not paid until after. Ibid.
The district courts of the United States have not power, in bankrupt cases, to remove assignees, or compel them to account. Lucas v. Morris, Paine's C. C. R. 396.
The holder of the negotiable paper, payable " without defalcation," under the laws of Pennsylvania, assigned after a commission of bankruptcy has issued, may come in under the commission; allowing all just offsets existing at the time of the bankruptcy, and which would have been admitted if the assignment had not been made. Humphreys v. Blight's Assignees, 1 Wash. C. C. R. 44.
The purchaser of a negotiable note, who becomes so after a commission of bankruptcy has issued, may prove under the commission; and he holds the note, subject to all legal offsets. Ibid.
The 65th section of the bankrupt law of the United States, passed the 2d of March, 1799, does not repeal the provisions of the laws of the United States, which give to the surety who pays bonds for duties, a preference over other creditors. Mott v. The Assignees of Maris, 2 Wash. C. C. R. 196.
The provisions of the bankrupt law except from its general operation, not only the preference of the United States, but also the right of preference for satisfaction of debts due to the United States. Ibid.
P. paid a sum of money to the United States, as surety of S., in a bond for duties. S. became insolvent, and assigned his effects to Baker, who received four thousand dollars under the assignment, mixed the same with his own funds, and afterwards became bankrupt, and the defendants were appointed his assignees ; but no effects, known to be part of the estate of S., came into their hands. The plaintiff claimed to have a preference and priority over the general creditors of Baker. By the Court--Although the United States might, under the 65th section of the law to regulate the collection of duties, be entitled to claim of the defendants to the amount which came into the hands of B., as the assignees of S., the provisions of the law do not extend to the surety who has paid the bond, the same rights and privileges. Pollock v. Pratt & Harvey, 2 Wash. C. C. R. 490.
A. H. devised an estate to C. S., for life ; and after the death of C. S., he directed that the estate should be sold, and divided among the grandchildren of the testator, who should be living at the death of C. S. B. married one of the grandchildren, and, before the death of C. S., B. became bankrupt. B. and wife, after the decease of C. S., sold the property claimed under the will of A. H., and the plaintiff claimed

with intent unlawfully to delay or defraud his or her creditors, depart from the state in which such person usually resides, or remain absent therefrom, or conceal him or herself therein, or keep his or her house, so that he or she cannot be taken, or served with process, or willingly or fraudulently procure him or herself to be arrested, or his or her lands, goods, money or chattels to be attached, sequestered, or taken in execution, or shall secretly convey his or her goods out of his or her house, or conceal them to prevent their being taken in execution, or make, or cause to be made, any fraudulent conveyance of his or her lands, or chattels, or make or admit any false or fraudulent security, or evidence of debt, or being arrested for debt, or having surrendered him or herself in discharge of bail, shall remain in prison two months, or more, or escape therefrom, or whose lands or effects being attached by process issuing out of, or returnable to, any court of common law, shall not, within two months after written notice thereof, enter special bail and dissolve the same, or in districts in which attachments are not dissolved by the entry of special bail, being arrested for debt after his or her lands and effects, or any part thereof, have been attached for a debt or debts amounting to one thousand dollars or upwards, shall not, upon notice of such attachment, give sufficient security for the payment of what may be recovered in the suit in which he or she shall be arrested, at or before the return day of the same, to be approved by the judge of the district, or some judge of the court out of which the process issued upon which he is arrested, or to which the same shall be returnable, every such person shall be deemed and adjudged a bankrupt: Provided, that no'person shall be liable to a commission of bankruptcy, if the petition be not preferred, in manner herein after directed, within six months after the act of bankruptcy committed.
Sec . 2. And be it further enacted, That the judge of the district court of the United States, for the district where the debtor resides, or usually resided at the time of committing the act of bankruptcy, upon petition, in writing, against such person or persons being bankrupt, to him to be exhibited by any one creditor, or by a greater number, being partners, whose single debt shall amount to one thousand dollars, or by two creditors, whose debts shall amount to one thousand five hundred dollars, or by more than two creditors, whose debts shall amount to two thousand dollars, shall have power, by commission under his hand and seal, to appoint such good and substantial persons, being citizens of the United States, and resident in such district, as such judge shall deem proper, not exceeding three, to be commissioners of the said bankrupt, and in case of vacancy or refusal to act, to appoint others from time to time, as occasion may require:(a) Provided always, that before any

under this conveyance. By the Court--The decisions of the English courts, abundantly prove that a possibility, whether belonging to the husband or the wife, would not pass to the assignees of the husband, on his becoming bankrupt, if it were not for the strong language of the statutes of bankruptcy. Krumbaar v. Burt, 2 Wash. C. C. R. 406.
The possibility held by B., under the will of A. H., formed no part of his estate to which he was entitled in law or equity, of which the commissioners could take possession under the 5th section of the bankrupt law of the United States ; and, therefore, they could not transfer it to the assignees of the bankrupt, under the provisions of the 6th section. Ibid.
The provisions of the English bankrupt laws, and those of the bankrupt law of the United States, differ in relation to the contingent interests of the bankrupt; and it is clear, that by the most liberal construction of the law, the interest of the husband in the estate of his wife, under the will of A. H., did not pass to the assignees. Ibid.
The provisions of the 13th section of the bankrupt law of the United States, do not affect this question ; they do not require an assignment of contingent interests, but relate to their disclosure by the bankrupt. Ibid.
So exclusively have bankrupt laws operated on traders, that it may well be doubted, whether an act of Congress, subjecting to such a law every description of persons within the United States, would comport with the spirit of the powers vested in them in relation thereto. Per Livingston, J. in Adams v. Storey, Paine's C. C. R. 79.
(a) By the 14th section of the act of April 29, 1802, entitled, " An act to amend the judicial system of the United States," the commissions in bankruptcy issued by the district judge were to be directed to general commissioners appointed by the President of the United States in each district.

affidavit or solemn affirmation before the said judge, of the truth of his,

her, or their debts, and give bond, to be taken by the said judge, in the

name, and for the benefit of the said party so charged as a bankrupt,

and in such penalty, and with such surety as he shall require to be con-

ditioned for the proving of his, her, or their debts, as well before the

commissioners as upon a trial at law, in case the due issuing forth of

the said commission shall be contested, and also for proving the party a

bankrupt, and to proceed on such commission, in the manner herein

prescribed. And if such debt shall not be really due, or after such com-

mission taken out it cannot be proved that the party was a bankrupt,

then the said judge shall, upon the petition of the party aggrieved, in

case there be occasion, deliver such bond to the said party, who may sue

thereon, and recover such damages, under the penalty of the same, as,

upon trial at law, he shall make appear he has sustained, by reason of

any breach of the condition thereof.

Sec . 3. And he it further enacted, That before the commissioners

shall be capable of acting, they shall respectively take and subscribe the

following oath or affirmation, which shall be administered by the judge

issuing the commission, or by any of the judges of the supreme court

of the United States, or any judge, justice, or chancellor of any state

court, and filed in the office of the clerk of the district court: " I, A. B.,

cording to the best of my skill and knowledge, execute the several

powers and trusts reposed in me, as a commissioner in a commission of

bankruptcy against

prejudice or malice." And the commissioners, who shall be sworn as

aforesaid, shall proceed, as soon as may be, to execute the same; and

upon due examination, and sufficient cause appearing against the party

charged, shall and may declare him or her to be a bankrupt: Provided,

that before such examination be had, reasonable notice thereof, in wri-

ting, shall be delivered to the person charged as a bankrupt; or if he,

or she, be not found at his or her usual place of abode, to some person

of the family above the age of twelve years, or if no such person appear,

shall be fixed at the front or other public door of the house, in which he

or she usually resides, and thereupon it shall be in the power of such

person, so charged as aforesaid, to demand before, or at the time ap-

pointed for such examination, that a jury be empanneled to inquire into

the fact or facts, alleged, as the causes for issuing the commission, and

on such demand being made, the inquiry shall be had before the judge

granting the commission, at such time as he may direct, and in that

case, such person shall not be declared bankrupt, unless, by the verdict

of the jury, he or she shall be found to be within the description of this

act, and shall be convicted of some one of the acts described in the

first section of this act: Provided also, that any commission which shall

be taken out as aforesaid, and which shall not be proceeded in as

aforesaid, within thirty days thereafter, may be superseded by the said

judge, who shall have granted the same, upon the application of the

party thereby charged as a bankrupt, or of any creditor of such per-

son, unless the delay shall have been unavoidable, or upon a just oc-

casion.

Sec . 4. And be it further enacted, That the commissioners so to be

appointed, shall have power forthwith, after they have declared such

person a bankrupt, to cause to be apprehended, by warrant under their

hands and seals, the body of such bankrupt, wheresoever to be found,

within the United States: Provided, they shall think, that there is rea-

son to apprehend that the said bankrupt intends to abscond or conceal

him or herself, and in case it be necessary, in order to take the body of

the said bankrupt, shall have power to cause the doors of the dwelling-

in which he or she shall be found. Sec . 5. And be it further enacted, That it shall be the duty of the
commissioners so to be appointed, forthwith, after they have declared such person a bankrupt, and they shall have power to take into their possession, all the estate, real and personal, of every nature and description to which the said bankrupt may be entitled, either in law or equity,
in any manner whatsoever^. and cause the same to be inventoried and appraised to the best value, (his or her necessary wearing apparel, and the necessary wearing apparel of the wife and children, and necessary beds and bedding of such bankrupt only excepted) and also to take into their possession, and secure, all deeds and books of account, papers and writings belonging to such bankrupt; and shall cause the same to be safely kept, until assignees shall be chosen or appointed, in manner hereafter provided.
Sec . 6. And be it further enacted, That the said commissioners shall forthwith, after they have declared such person a bankrupt, cause due and sufficient public notice thereof to be given, and in such notice shall appoint some convenient time and place for the creditors to meet, in order to choose an assignee or assignees of the said bankrupt's estate and effects;--at which meeting the said commissioners shall admit the creditors of such bankrupt to prove their debts;--and where any credit-
or shall reside at a distance from the place of such meeting, shall allow the debt of such creditor to be proved by oath or affirmation, made before some competent authority, and duly certified, and shall permit any person duly authorized by letter of attorney from such creditor, due proof of the execution of such letter of attorney being first made, to vote in the choice of an assignee or assignees of such bankrupt's estate and effects, in the place and stead of such creditor: and the said commissioners shall assign, transfer or deliver over, all and singular the said bankrupt's estate and effects, aforesaid, with all muniments and evidences thereof, to such person or persons as the major part, in value, of such creditors, according to the several debts then proved, shall choose as aforesaid: Provided always, that in such choice, no vote shall be given by, or in behalf of any creditor whose debt shall not amount to two hundred dollars.

which assignee or assignees aforesaid, or any of them, may be removed at the meeting of the creditors, so to be appointed as aforesaid, for the choice of assignees, if such creditors, entitled to vote as aforesaid, or the major part, in value, of them, shall think fit; and such assignee or assignees as shall be so removed, shall deliver up all the estate and effects of such bankrupt, which shall have come to his or their hands or possession, unto such other assignee or assignees as shall be chosen by the creditors as aforesaid; and all such estate and effects shall be, to all intents and purposes, as effectually and legally vested in such new assignee or assignees, as if the first assignment had been made to him or them, by the said commissioners; and if such first assignee or assignees
shall refuse or neglect, for the space of ten days next after notice, in writing, from such new assignee or assignees of their appointment, (a) as aforesaid, to deliver over as aforesaid, all the estate and effects as aforesaid, every such assignee or assignees shall, respectively, forfeit a sum not exceeding five thousand dollars, for the use of the creditors, and shall moreover be liable for the property so detained.

Sec . 10. And be it further enacted, That the assignment or assignments of the commissioners of the bankrupt's estate and effects as aforesaid, made as aforesaid, shall be good at law or in equity, against the bankrupt; and all persons claiming by, from, or under such bankrupt, by any act done at the time, or after he shall have committed the act of
bankruptcy, upon which the commission issued: Provided always, that in case of a bona fide purchase made before the issuing of the commission from or under such bankrupt, for a valuable consideration, by any
person having no knowledge, information, or notice of any act of bankruptcy committed, such purchase shall not be invalidated or impeached.
Sec . 11. And be it further enacted, That the said commissioners shall have power, by deed or deeds, under their hands and seals, to assign

Sec . 12. And be it further enacted, That if any bankrupt shall have conveyed or assured any lands, goods or estate, unto any person, upon condition or power of redemption, by payment of money or otherwise, it shall be lawful for the commissioners, or for any person by them duly authorized for that purpose, by writing, under their hands and seals, to

such condition, as fully as the bankrupt might have done; and the com-

missioners, after such performance or tender, shall have power to assign

such lands, goods and estate, for the benefit of the creditors, as fully

and effectually as any other part of the estate of such bankrupt.

Sec . 13. And be it further enacted, That the commissioners aforesaid

shall have power to assign, for the use aforesaid, all the debts due to

such bankrupt, or to any other person for his or her use or benefit;

which assignment shall vest the property and right thereof in the as-

signee or assignees of such bankrupt, as fully as if the bond, judgment,

contract, or claim, had originally belonged or been made to the said

assignees; and after the said assignment, neither the said bankrupt, nor

any person acting as trustee for him or her, shall have power to recover

or discharge the same, nor shall the same be attached as the debt of the

said bankrupt; but the assignee or assignees aforesaid shall have such

remedy to recover the same, in his or their own name or names, as such

bankrupt might or could have had, if no commission of bankruptcy had

issued. And when any action in the name of such bankrupt shall have

been commenced, and shall be pending for the recovery of any debt or

effects of such bankrupt, which shall be assigned, or shall, or might be-

come vested in the assignee or assignees of such bankrupt as aforesaid,

then such assignee or assignees may claim to be, and shall be thereupon

admitted to prosecute such action in his or their name, for the use and

benefit of the creditors of such bankrupt; and the same judgment shall

be rendered in such action, and all attachments or other security taken

therein, shall be in like manner holden and liable, as if the said action

had been originally commenced in the name of such assignee or as-

signees, after the original plaintiff therein had become a bankrupt as

aforesaid: Provided, that where a debtor shall have, bona fide, paid his

debt to any bankrupt, without notice that such person was bankrupt, he

or she shall not be liable to pay the same to the assignee or assignees.

or information given to the commissioners, or if they shall have good

reason to believe or suspect, that any of the property, goods, chattels, or

debts, of the bankrupt, are in the possession of any other person, or that

any person is indebted to, or for the use of the bankrupt, then the said

commissioners shall have power to summon, or to cause to be sum-

moned, by their attorney or other person duly authorized by them, all

such persons before them, or the judge of the district where such person

shall reside, by such process, or other means, as they shall think con-

venient, and upon their appearance, toexamine them by parole or by inter-

rogatories, in writing, on oath, or affirmation, which oath or affirmation

they are hereby empowered to administer, respecting the knowledge of

all such property, goods, chattels, and debts; and if such person shall

refuse to be sworn or affirmed, and to make answer to such questions or

interrogatories as shall be administered, and to subscribe the said an-

swers, or upon examination shall not declare the whole truth, touching

the subject matter of such examination, then it shall be lawful for the

commissioners, or judge, to commit such person to prison, there to be

detained until they shall submit themselves to be examined in manner

aforesaid, and they shall, moreover, forfeit double the value of all the

property, goods, chattels, and debts, by them concealed.

Sec . 15. And be it further enacted, That if any of the aforesaid

persons shall, after legal summons to appear before the commissioners

or judge, to be examined, refuse to attend, or shall not attend at the

time appointed, having no such impediment as shall be allowed of by

the commissioners or judge, it shall be lawful for the said commissioners

or judge to direct their warrants to such person or persons as by them

shall be thought proper, to apprehend such persons as shall refuse to ap-

pear, and to bringthem before the commissioners or judge, to be examined,

Ar t . VII. The citizens and inhabitants of the United States shall be at liberty to dispose by testament, donation, or otherwise, of their goods, moveable and immoveable, holden in the territory of the French Republic in Europe, and the citizens of the French Republic shall have the same liberty with regard to goods, moveable and immoveable, holden in the territory of the United States, in favor of such persons as they shall think proper. The citizens and inhabitants of either of the two countries, who shall be heirs of goods, moveable or immoveable, in the other, shall be able to succeed ab intestato, without being obliged to obtain letters of naturalization, and without having the effect of this provision contested or impeded, under any pretext whatever; and the said heirs, whether such by particular title, or ab intestato, shall be exempt from any duty whatever in both countries. It is agreed that this article shall in no manner derogate from the laws which either state may now have in force, or hereafter may enact, to prevent emigration ; and also that in case the laws of either of the two states should restrain strangers from the exercise of the rights of property with respect to real estate, such real estate may be sold, or otherwise disposed of, to citizens or inhabitants of the country where it may be, and the other nation shall be at liberty to enact similar laws.

In case of war between the two nations, six months to be allowed to remove property.

Art . VIII. To favor commerce on both sides, it is agreed, that, in case a war should break out between the two nations, which God forbid, the term of six months after the declaration of war shall be allowed to the merchants and other citizens and inhabitants respectively, on one side and the other, during which time they shall be at liberty to withdraw themselves, with their effects and moveables, which they shall be at liberty to carry, send away, or sell, as they please, without the least obstruction; nor shall their effects, much less their persons be seized, during such term of six months; on the contrary, passports, which shall be valid for a time necessary for their return, shall be given to them for their vessels and the effects which they shall be willing to send away or carry with them; and such passports shall be a safe conduct against all insults and prizes which privateers may attempt against their persons and effects.

Les Citoyens et Habitans des Etats-Unis pourront disposer par testament, donation ou autrement, de leurs biens, meubles et immeubles possedes dans le territoire Europeen de la Republique Frangaise; et les citoyens de la Republique Frangaise auront la meme faculte a 1'egard des biens, meubles et immeubles possedes dans le Territoire des Etats-Unis, en faveur de telle personne que bon leur semblera. Les citoyens et habitans d'un des deux Etats, qui seront heritiers des Biens, meubles ou immeubles situes dans 1'autre, pourront succeder ab intestat, sans qu'ils ayent besoin de lettres de naturalite et sans que 1'effet de cette stipulation, leur puisse etre conteste ou empeche, sous quelque pretexte que ce soit; et seront les dits heritiers, soit a titre particulier, soit ab intestat, exempts de tout droit quelconque chex les deux nations. Il est convenu que cet article ne derogera en aucune maniere aux lois qui sont a present en vigeur chez les deux nations ou qui pourraient etre promulguees a la suite centre 1'emigration, et aussi que dans le cas ou les lois de 1'un des deux Etats limiteraient pour les etrangers 1'exercise des droits de la propriete sur les immeubles on pourrait vendre ces immeubles ou en disposer autrement en faveur d'habitans ou de citoyens du pays ou ils seraient situes, et il sera libre a 1'autre nation d'etablir de semblables lois.

Leurs effets, et encore moins leurs personnes, ne pourront point, pendent ce terns de six mois, etre saisis; au contraire, on leur donnera des passeports qui seront valables pour le terns necessaire a, leur retour chez eux; et ces passeports seront donnes pour eux, ainsi que pour leur batimens et effets qui'ls desireront emmener ou envoyer. Ces passeports serviront de sauf-conduit centre toute insulte et centre toute capture de la part des corsaires, tant centre eux que centre leur effets; et si, dans le terme ci-dessus designe, il leur etait fait par 1'une des parties, ces citoyens ou ses habitans, quelque tort dans leur personnes ou dans leurs effets, on leur en donnera satisfaction complete.
Art . IX.

they may be, or by what name soever called, than those which the nation most favored are, or shall be obliged to pay; and they shall enjoy all the rights, liberties, privileges, immunities and exemptions in trade, navigation and commerce, whether in passing from one port in the said states to another, or in going to and from the same from and to any part of the world, which the said nations do or shall enjoy. And the citizens of the United States shall reciprocally enjoy in the territories of the French Republic in Europe, the same privileges and immunities,
as well for their property and persons, as for what concerns trade,
navigation and commerce.

Citizens of France and of the U. S. to be at liberty to trade from enemies' to other ports of either country unless blockaded.
Notice of blockade to be given before capture of vessels ; and vessels to be permitted to go to other ports.

Art . XII. It shall be lawful for the citizens of either country to sail with their ships and merchandize (contraband goods always excepted) from any port whatever to any port of the enemy of the other, and to
sail and trade with their ships and merchandise, with perfect security and liberty, from the countries, ports and places of those who are enemies of both, or of either party, without any opposition or disturbance whatsoever, and to pass not only directly from the places and ports of the enemy aforementioned, to neutral ports and places, but also from one place belonging to an enemy, to another place belonging to an enemy, whether they be under the jurisdiction of the same power, or
under the several; unless such ports or places shall be actually blockaded, besieged or invested.
And whereas it frequently happens, that vessels sail for a port or place belonging to an enemy, without knowing that the same is either besieged, blockaded or invested, it is agreed that every vessel, so circumstanced,
may be turned away from such port or place, but she shall not be detained, nor any part of her cargo, if not contraband, be confiscated,
unless, after notice of such blockade or investment, she shall again attempt to enter; but she shall be permitted to go to any other port or place she shall think proper. Nor shall any vessel of either, that may
have entered into such port or place before the same was actually besieged, blockaded, or invested by the other, be restrained from quitting such place with her cargo, nor if found therein after the reduction and
surrender of such place, shall such vessel or her cargo be liable to confiscation, but they shall be restored to the owners thereof.

Vessels laden with contraband goods, the residue of the cargo, not to be infected by the prohibited goods. Free ships make free goods; not contraband, although belonging to an enemy. Persons not military to be protected in free ships.

Art . XIII. In order to regulate what shall be deemed contraband of war, there shall be comprised under that denomination, gun-powder, saltpetre, petards, match, ball, bombs, grenades, carcasses, pikes, halberts, swords, belts, pistols, holsters, cavalry saddles and furniture, cannon, mortars, their carriages and beds, and generally all kinds of arms, ammunition of war, and instruments fit for the use of troops; all the above articles, whenever they are destined to the port of an enemy, are hereby declared to be contraband, and just objects of confiscation; but the vessel in which they are laden, and the residue of the cargo, shall be considered free, and not in any manner infected by the prohibited goods, whether belonging to the same, or a different owner.
Art . XIV. It is hereby stipulated that free ships shall give a freedom to goods, and that every thing shall be deemed to be free and exempt which shall be found on board the ships belonging to the citizens of either of the contracting parties, although the whole lading, or any part thereof, should appertain to the enemies of either, contraband goods being always excepted. It is also agreed, in like manner, that the same liberty be extended to persons who are on board a free ship, with this effect, that although they be enemies to either party, they are to be

sent etre, quelque nom qu'ils puissent avoir, que ceux que les nations les plus favorisees sont ou seront tenues de payer; et ils jouiront de tous les droits, libertes, privileges, immunites, et exemptions en fait de negoce, navigation et commerce, soit en passant d'un port des dits Etats a un autre, soit en y allant ou en revenant de quelque partie ou pour quelque partie du monde que ce soit, dont les nations susdites jouissent ou jouiront. Et reciproquement, les citoyens des Etats-Unis jouiront, dans le Territoire de la Republique Francaise-en Europe, des memes privileges, immunites, tant pour leurs biens et leurs personnes, que pour ce qui concerne le negoce, la navigation et le commerce.
Art . XII. Les citoyens des deux nations pourront conduire leurs vaisseaux et marchandises (en exceptant toujours la contrebande) de tout port quelconque, dans un autre port appartenant a 1'ennemi de 1'autre nation; ils pourront naviguer et commercer en toute liberte et securite, avec leurs navire set marchandises, dans les pays, ports et places des ennemis des deux parties ou de 1'une ou de 1'autre partie, sans obstacles et sans entraves, et non seulement passer directement des places et ports de 1'ennemi sus mentionnes, dans les ports et places neutres, mais encore de toute place appartenant a un ennemi dans toute autre place appartenant a un ennemi, qu'elle soit ou ne soit pas soumise a la meme jurisdiction, a moins que ces places ou ports ne soyent reellement bloques, assieges ou investis.
Et dans le cas, comme il arrive souvent, ou les vaisseaux feraient voile pour une place ou port appartenant a un ennemi, ignorant qu'ils sont blocques, assieges ou investis, il est convenu que tout navire qui se trouvera dans une pareille circonstance, sera detourne de cette place ou port, sans qu'on puisse le retener ni confisquer aucune partie de sa cargaison (a moins qu'elle ne soit de contrebande, ou qu'ilne soit prouvee
que le dit navire, apres avoir ete averti du blocus ou investissement, a
voulu rentrer dans ce meme port); mais il lui sera permis d'aller dans tout autre port ou place qu'il jugera convenable. Aucun navire de 1'une ou de 1'autre nation, entre dans un port au place avant qu'ils ayent ete reellement bloques, assieges ou investis par 1'autre, ne pourra etre empeche de sortir avec sa cargaison: s'il s'y trouve, lorsque la dite place sera rendue, le navire et sa cargaison ne pourront etre confisques, mais seront remis aux proprietaires.
Art . XIII. Pour regler ce qu'on entendra par contrebande de guerre, seront compris sous cette denomination la poudre, le salpetre, les petards, meches, balles, boulets, bombes, grenades, carcasses, piques, hallebardes, epees, ceinturons, pistolets, foureaux, selles de cavalerie, harnais, canons, mortiers avec leurs affuts, et generalement toutes armes et munitions de guerre et untensiles, a, 1'usage des troupes. Tous les articles ci-dessus, toutes les fois qu'ils seront destines pour le port d'un ennemi, sont declares de contrabande et justement soumis a la confiscation. Mais le batiment sur lequel ils etaient charges, ainsi que le reste de la cargaison, seront regardes comme libres, et ne pourront en aucune maniere etre vicies par les marchandises de contrebande, soit qu'ils appartiennent a un meme ou a differens proprietaires.
Art . XIV. Il est stipule par le present traite que les batimens libres assureront egalement la liberte des marchandises, et qu'on jugera libres toutes les choses qui se trouveront a bord des navires appartenant aux citoyens d'une des parties contractantes, quand meme le chargement ou partie d'icelui appartiendrait aux ennemis de 1'une des deux; bien entendu neanmoins que la contrebande sera toujours excepte. Il est egalement convenu que cette meme liberte s'etendra aux personnes qui pourraient se trouver a bard du batiment libre, quand meme elles

taken out of that free ship, unless they are soldiers and in actual service of the enemy.

Confiscation of goods laden on board of an enemy's vessel after war is declared.

Art . XV. On the contrary, it is agreed, that whatever shall be found to be laden by the citizens of either party on any ship belonging to the enemies of the other, or their citizens, shall be confiscated without distinction of goods, contraband or not contraband, in the same manner as if it belonged to the enemy, except such goods and merchandizes as were put on board such ship before the declaration of war, or even after such declaration, if so be it were done without knowledge of such declaration ; so that the goods of the citizens of either party, whether they be of the nature of such as are prohibited, or otherwise, which, as is aforesaid, were put on board any ship belonging to an enemy, before the war, or after the declaration of the same, without the knowledge of it, shall no ways be liable to confiscation, but shall well and truly be restored without delay to the proprietors demanding the same; but so as that if the said merchandizes be contraband, it shall not be any ways lawful to carry them afterwards to any ports belonging to the enemy. The two contracting parties agree, that the term of two months being passed after the declaration of war, their respective citizens, from whatever part of the world they come, shall not plead the ignorance mentioned in this article.

Passports to be exhibited, and also certificates of the quality of goods.

Art . XVI. The merchant ships belonging to the citizens of either of the contracting parties, which shall be bound to a port of the enemy of one of the parties, and concerning whose voyage, and the articles of their cargo, there shall be just grounds of suspicion, shall be obliged to exhibit, as well upon the high seas as in the ports or roads, not only their passports, but likewise their certificates, showing that their goods are not of the quality of those which are specified to be contraband in the thirteenth article of the present convention.

In time of war the ships of the neutral nation to be furnished with passports mentioned in the fourth article.
If contraband goods found on board are delivered up, the ship may pursue her voyage.

Art . XVII. And that captures on light suspicions may be avoided, and injuries thence arising prevented, it is agreed, that when one party shall be engaged in war, and the other party be neuter, the ships of the neutral party shall be furnished with passports similar to that described in the fourth article, that it may appear thereby that the ships really belong to the citizens of the neutral party; they shall be valid for any number of voyages, but shall be renewed every year, that is, if the ship happens to return home in the space of a year. If the ships are laden, they shall be provided not only with the passports above mentioned, but also with certificates similar to those described in the same article, so that it may be known whether they carry any contraband goods. No other paper shall be required, any usage or ordinance to the contrary notwithstanding. And if it shall not appear from the said certificates that there are contraband goods on board, the ships shall be permitted to proceed on their voyage. If it shall appear from the certificates, that there are contraband goods on board any such ship, and the commander of the same shall offer to deliver them up, the offer shall be accepted, and the ship shall be at liberty to pursue its voyage, unless the quantity of the contraband goods be greater than can conveniently be received on board the ship of war or privateer, in which case the ship may be carried into port, for the delivery of the same.

If any ship shall not be furnished with such passport or certificates as are above required for the same, such case may be examined by a pro-

seraient ennemies de 1'une de deux parties contractantes, et elles ne pourront etre enlevees des dits navires libres, a moins qu'elles ne soyent militaires et actuellement au service de 1'ennemi.
Art . XV. On est convenu, au contraire que tout ce qui se trouvera charge par les citoyens respectifs, sur des navires appartenant aux ennemis de 1'autre partie ou a leurs sujets, sera confisque, sans distinctions des marchandises prohibees ou non prohibees, ainsi et de meme que si elles appartenaient a 1'ennemi, a 1'exception toutefois des effets et marchandises qui auront ete mis a bord des dits navires avant la declaration de guerre, ou meme apres la dite declaration, si, au moment du chargement, on a pu 1'ignorer; de maniere que les marchandises des citoyens des deux parties, soit qu'elles se trouvent du nombre de celles de contrebande ou autrement, lesquelles, comme il vient d'etre dit, auront ete mises a bord d'un vaisseau appartenant a 1'ennemi avant la guerre, ou meme apres la dite declaration lorsqu'on 1'ignorait, ne seront, en aucune maniere, sujettes a confiscation, mais seront fidelement et de bonne foi rendues, sans delai, a leurs proprietaires qui les reclameront; bien entendu neanmoins qu'il ne soit pas permis de porter dans les ports ennemis les marchandises qui seront de contrebande. Les deux parties contractantes conviennent que le terme de deux mois passe depuis la declaration de guerre, leurs citoyens respectifs, de quelque partie du monde qu'ils viennent, ne pourront plus alleguer 1'ignorance dont il est question dans le present article.
Art . XVI. Les navires marchands appartenant a des citoyens de 1'une ou d'autre des deux parties contractantes, lorsqu'ils voudront passer dans le port de 1'ennemi de 1'une des deux parties, et que leur voyage ainsi que les effets de leur cargaison pourront donner de justes soup^ons, les dits navires seront obliges d'exhiber en pleine mer, comme dans les ports ou rades, non seulement leurs passeports, mais encore leurs certificats prouvant que ces effets ne sont point de la meme espece que ceux de contrebande specifies dans Particle treize de la presente convention.
Art . XVII. Et afin d'eviter des captures sur des soupcons frivoles, et de prevenir les dommages qui en resultent, il est convenu que, quand une des deux parties sera en guerre et 1'autre neutre, les navires de la partie neutre seront pourvus de passeports semblables a ceux specifies dans Particle quatre, de maniere qu'il puisse par la apparaitre que les navires appartiennent veritablement a la partie neutre. Ces passeports seront valides pour un nombre quelconque de voyages; mais il seront renouvelles chaque annee, si le navire retourne chez lui dans Pespace d'une annee. Si ces navires sont charges, ils seront pourvus non seulement des passeports sus mentionnes mais aussi de certificats semblables a ceux mentionnes au meme article, de maniere que Pon puisse connaitre s'il ya a bord des marchandises de contrebande. Il ne sera exige aucune autre piece, non obstant tous usages et regiemens contraries; et s'il n'apparait pas par ces certificats qu'il y ait des marchandises de contrebande a bord, les navires seront laisses a leur destination. Si, au contraire, il apparait, par ces certificats, que les dits navires ayent des marchandises de contrebande a bord, et que le commandant offre de les delivrer, Poffre sera acceptee, et le navire sera remis en liberte de poursuivre son voyage; a moins que la quantite de marchandises de contrebande ne soit trop grande pour pouvoir etre prise convenablement a bord du vaisseau de guerre ou corsaire; dans ce cas le navire pourra etre amene dans le port pour y delivrer la dite marchandise.
Si un navire est trouve sans avoir le passeport ou les certificats cidessus exiges, Paffaire sera examinee par les juges ou tribunaux com-

If there is no passport and other proof of the neutrality of the vessel, no condemnation. If master of the vessel dies, the ship and cargo shall be secure. Ships of either nation if examined at sea, boats to be sent, and ships of war or privateers to remain out of cannon shot.

per judge or tribunal, and if it shall appear from other documents or proofs, admissible by the usage of nations, that the ship belongs to the citizens of the neutral party, it shall not be confiscated, but shall be released with her cargo (contraband goods excepted) and be permitted to proceed on her voyage.
If the master of a ship, named in the passport, should happen to die or be removed by any other cause, and another put in his place, the ship and cargo shall nevertheless be equally secure, and the passport remain in full force.
Ar t . XVIII. If the ships of the citizens of either of the parties shall be met with, either sailing along the coasts, or on the high seas, by any ship of war or privateer of the other; for the avoiding of any disorder, the said ships of war or privateers shall remain out of cannon shot, and may send their boats on board the merchant ship which they shall so meet with, and may enter her to the number of two or three men only, to whom the master or commander of such ship shall exhibit his passport concerning the property of the ship, made out according to the form prescribed in the fourth article. And it is expressly agreed that the neutral party shall in no case be required to go on board the examining vessel for the purpose of exhibiting his papers, or for any other examination whatever.

Ships under convoy not to be examined.

Ar t . XIX. It is expressly agreed by the contracting parties, that the stipulations above mentioned, relative to the conduct to be observed on the sea by the cruisers of the belligerent party towards the ships of the neutral party, shall be applied only to ships sailing without convoy; and when the said ships shall be convoyed, it being the intention of the parties to observe all the regard due to the protection of the flag displayed by public ships, it shall not be lawful to visit them: but the verbal declaration of the commander of the convoy, that the ships he convoys belong to the nation whose flag he carries, and that they have no contraband goods on board, shall be considered by the respective cruisers as fully sufficient: the two parties reciprocally engaging not to admit under the protection of their convoys, ships which shall carry contraband goods destined to an enemy.

Receipts to be given for the papers of captured vessels.
Sale of captured vessels not to be made without lawful condemnation. The master, commander or supercargo not to be removed.

Art . XX. In all cases where vessels shall be captured, or detained under pretence of carrying to the enemy contraband goods, the captor shall give a receipt for such of the papers of the vessel as he shall retain, which receipt shall be annexed to a descriptive list of the said papers: and it shall be unlawful to break up or open the hatches, chests, trunks, casks, bales, or vessels, found on board, or remove the smallest part of the goods, unless the lading be brought on shore in presence of the competent officers, and an inventory be made by them of the said goods. Nor shall it be lawful to sell, exchange or alienate the same in any manner, unless there shall have been lawful process, and the competent judge or judges shall have pronounced against such goods sentence of confiscation, saving always the ship and the other goods which it contains.
Art . XXI. And that proper care may be taken of the vessel and cargo, and embezzlement prevented, it is agreed that it shall not be lawful to remove the master, commander or supercargo of any captured ship from on board thereof, either during the time the ship may be at sea after her capture, or pending the proceedings against her, or her cargo, or any thing relative thereto. And in all cases where a vessel of the citizens of either party shall be captured, or seized, and held for adjudication, her officers, passengers and crew shall be hospitably

Si le capitaine norame dans le passeport du navire venait a mourir, ou a etre ote par toute. autre cause, et qu'un autre fut nomine a sa place, le navire et sa cargaison n'en seront pas moins en surete, et le passeport demeurera dans toute sa force.
Art . XVIII. Si les batimens des citoyens de 1'une ou 1'autre nation sont rencontres le long des cotes, ou en pleine mer, par quelques vaisseaux de guerre ou corsaires de 1'autre; pour prevenir tout desordre, les dits vaisseaux ou corsaires se tiendront hors de la portee du canon et enverront leur canot a. bord du navire marchand qu'ils auront rencontre : ils n'y pourront entrer qu'au nombre de deux ou trois hommes, et demander au patron ou capitaine du dit navire, exhibition du passeport concernant la propriete du dit navire, fait d'apres la tormule prescrite dans Particle quatre, ainsi que les certificats sus mentionnes relatifs a la cargaison. Il est expressement convenu que le neutre ne pourra etre contraint d'aller a. bord du vaisseau visitant pour y faire Fexhibition demandee des papiers ou pour toute autre information quelconque.
Art . XIX. Il est expressement convenu par les parties contractantes, que les stipulations ci-dessus, relatives a la conduite qui sera tenue a la mer par les croiseurs de la partie belligerante, envers les batimens de la partie neutre, ne s'appliqueront qu'aux batimens naviguant sans convoi; et dans le cas ou les dits batimens seraient convoyes, 1'intention des parties etant d'observer tous les egards dus a la protection du pavilion abore sur les vaisseaux publics, on ne pourra point en faire la visite. Mais la declaration verbale du commandant de I'escorte, que les navires de son convoi appartiennent a la nation dont ils portent le pavilion, et qu'ils n'ont aucune contrabande a bord, sera regardee par les croiseurs respectifs comme pleinement suffisante; les deux parties s'engageant reciproquement a ne point admettre sous la protection de leur convoi, des batimens qui porteraient des marchandises prohibees a une destination ennemie.
Art . XX. Dans le cas ou les batimens seront pris ou arretes, sous pretexte de porter a 1'ennemi quelqu'article de contrebande, le capteur donnera un re^u des papiers du batiment qu'il retiendra, lequel re^u sera joint a une liste enonciative des dits papiers: il ne sefra point permis de forcer ni d'ouvrir les ecoutilles, coffres, caisses, caissons, balles, ou vases trouves a bord du dit navire, ni d'enlever la moindre chose des effets, avant que la cargaison ait ete debarquee en presence des officiers competens, qui feront un inventaire des dits effet; ils ne pourront, en aucune maniere etre vendus, echanges ou alienes, a moins qu'apres une procedure legale, le juge ou les juges competens n'ayent porte centre les dits effets sentence de confiscation (en exceptant toujours le navire

Ar t . XXIV. When the ships of war of the two contracting parties, or those belonging to their citizens which are armed in war, shall be admitted to enter with their prizes the ports of either of the two parties, the said public or private ships as well as their prizes, shall not be obliged to pay any duty either to the officers of the place, the judges or any others; nor shall such prizes, when they come to and enter the ports of either party, be arrested or seized, nor shall the officers of the place make examination concerning the lawfulness of such prizes; but they may hoist sail at any time and depart and carry their prizes to the places expressed in their commissions, which the commanders of such ships of war shall be obliged to shew.
