evasion, it is not sufficient that the party introduces another article perfectly lawful, which defeats the policy contemplated by the act, or which supersedes or diminishes the use of the article taxed by the act. There must be substantially an introduction of the very thing' taxed, under a false denomination

A TREATY OF PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP

Made and concluded between William Clark, Ninian Edwards, and Auguste Chouteau, commissioners plenipotentiary of the United States of America, on the part and behalf of the said states, of the one part, and the undersigned chiefs and warriors of the Sacs of Rock river and the adjacent country, of the other part.

May 13, 1816. Proclamation, Dec. 30, 1816.

Whe re as by the ninth article of the treaty of peace, which was concluded on the twenty-fourth day of December, eighteen hundred and fourteen, between the United States and Great Britain, at Ghent, and which was ratified by the president, with the advice and consent of the senate, on the seventeenth day of February, eighteen hundred and fifteen, it was stipulated that the said parties should severally put an end to all hostilities with the Indian tribes, with whom they might be at war, at the time of the ratification of said treaty; and to place the said tribes inhabiting their respective territories, on the same footing upon which they stood before the war: Provided, they should agree to desist from all hostilities against the said parties, their citizens or subjects respectively, upon the ratification of the said treaty being notified to them, and should so desist accordingly.
And whereas the United States being determined to execute every article of the treaty with perfect good faith, and wishing to be particularly exact in the execution of the article above alluded to, relating to the Indian tribes: The president, in consequence thereof, for that purpose, on the eleventh day of March, eighteen hundred and fifteen, appointed the undersigned William Clark, governor of Missouri territory, Ninian Edwards, governor of Illinois territory, and Auguste Chouteau, esq. of the Missouri territory, commissioners, with full power to conclude a treaty of peace and amity with all those tribes of Indians, conformably to the stipulations contained in the said article, on the part of the United States, in relation to such tribes.
And whereas the commissioners, in conformity with their instructions in the early part of last year, notified the Sacs of Rock river, and the adjacent country, of the time of the ratification of said treaty; of the stipulations it contained in relation to them; of the disposition of the American government to fulfil those stipulations, by entering into a treaty with them, conformably thereto; and invited the said Sacs of Rock river, and the adjacent country, to send forward a deputation of their chiefs to meet the said commissioners at Portage des Sioux, for the purpose of concluding such a treaty as aforesaid, between the United States and the said Indians, and the said Sacs of Rock river, and the adjacent country, having not only declined that friendly overture, but having continued their hostilities, and committed many depredations thereafter, which would have justified the infliction of the severest chastisement upon them; but having earnestly repented of their conduct, now imploring mercy, and being anxious to return to the habits of peace and friendship with the United States; and the latter being always disposed to pursue the most liberal and humane policy towards the Indian tribes within their territory, preferring their reclamation by peaceful measures, to their punishment, by the application of the mili-
tary force of the nation -- Now, therefore,

Gin port, on the Tombigby river, which tracts of land will be pointed out by major Levi Colbert, and for the use of said Colbert and heirs.

Art . 7. " Whereas the chiefs and warriors of the Chickasaw nation have found, from experience, that the crowd of pedlars, who are constantly traversing their nation from one end to the other, is of a serious disadvantage to the nation; that serious misunderstandings and disputes frequently take place, as well as frauds, which are often practised on the ignorant and uninformed of the nation, therefore it is agreed by the commissioners on the part of the government, and the chiefs of the nation, that no more licenses shall be granted by the agent of the Chickasaws to entitle any person or persons to trade or traffic merchandise in said nation; and that any person or persons, whomsoever, of the white people, who shall bring goods and sell them in the nation, contrary to this article, shall forfeit the whole of his or their goods, one half to the nation and the other half to the government of the United States; in all cases where this article is violated, and the goods are taken or seized, they shall be delivered up to the agent, who shall hear the testimony and judge accordingly."

fort ou autre que ceux auxquels seraient assujettis les memes articles, s'ils etaient exportes pour tout autre pays quelconque.

Il ne sera non plus impose aucune prohibition, ni sur 1'exportation ni sur 1'importation d'aucun article provenant du sol ou des manufactures des Etats Unis ou des pays de sa Majeste le Roi de Suede et de Norvege, dans ou hors les dits Etats Unis, et dans ou hors les dits pays de sa Majeste le Roi de Suede et de Norvege, qui en s'etende egalement a toutes les autres nations.
Les vaisseaux des Etats Unis d'Amerique arrivant sur leur lest ou important dans les Etats de sa Majeste le Roi de Suede et Norvege des produits du sol ou de 1'industrie de leur pays, ou exportant des Etats de sa Majeste Suedoise et Norvegienne les produits du sol ou de 1'industrie nationale des dits Etats, ne seront tenus a payer, ni pour les vaisseaux ni pour les cargaisons aucuns droits, impots ou charges quelconques, plus forts ou autres que ceux que payeraient dans le meme cas les vaisseaux des Etats de sa Majeste le Roi de Suede et de Norveges, et vice versa; les vaisseaux des Etats de sa Majeste le Roi de Suede et de Norvege qui arrivent sur leur lest ou qui importent dans les Etats Unis de 1'Amerique des productions du sol ou de 1'industrie nationale de la Suede et de la Norvege, ou qui exportent des Etats Unis des produits du sol ou de 1'industrie de ces pays, ne payeront ni pour les vaisseaux ni pour les cargaisons aucuns droits, impots ou charges quelconques, autres ou plus forts que ceux qui seraient payes si ces memes denrees etaient transportees par des vaisseaux des Etats Unis respectivement.
Ce qui est statue ci-dessus s'etendra aussi a la colonie Suedoise de St. Barthelemy, tant par rapport aux droits et avantages dont les vaisseaux des Etats Unis jouiront dans ses ports que par rapport a ceux dont les vaisseaux de la colonie jouiront dans les ports des Etats Unis; bien entendu que les proprietaires soyent colons etablis et naturalises a St. Barthelemy, et qu'ils y ayent fait naturaliser leurs vaisseaux.

ARTICLE TROISIEME. Sa Majeste le Roi de Suede et de Norvege consent que tous les articles qui sont le produit du sol ou des manufactures des Indes Occidentales et dont 1'entree est permise dans des vaisseaux Suedois ou Norvegiens, soit que ces marchandises viennent directement ou indirectement des dites Indes, puissent aussi etre importes dans ses Etats par des vaisseaux des Etats Unis, et qu'alors il ne sera paye ni pour les dits vaisseaux, ni pour les cargaisons, de droits, impots ou charges quelconques, plus forts ou autres que ceux qui seraient payes par des vaisseaux Suedois ou Norvegiens dans le meme cas, avec une addition seulement de dix pour cent sur les dits droits, impots, ou charges, et pas davantage. Pour eviter tout mesentendu a cet egard il est ici expressement declare, que la denomination d'lndes Occidentales doit etre prise dans le sens le plus etendu en y comprenant toute cette partie du monde, soit lies ou terre ferme, qui de tout terns a ete appellee Indes Occidentales, en opposition avec cette autre partie du monde appellee Indes Orientales.
ARTICLE QUATRIEME. De leur cote les Etats Unis d'Amerique consentent a ce que tous les articles qui sont les produits du sol ou des manufactures des pays qui bordent ou environnent la mer Baltique et dont 1'entree est permise dans les vaisseaux des Etats Unis, soit que ces denrees viennent directement ou indirectement de la Baltique, puissent aussi etre importes de meme dans les Etats Unis, par des vaisseaux Suedois ou Norvegiens, et qu'a-

paid for the said vessels, or for the cargoes, any higher or other duties, imposts, or charges, whatsoever, than those which would be paid by vessels of the United States in the same circumstances, with an addition only of ten per centum on the said duties, imposts, and charges,
and no more. In order to avoid all uncertainty in respect to the duties, imposts, or
charges, whatsoever, which a vessel belonging to the citizens or subjects of one of the contracting parties ought to pay, on arriving in the ports of the other, with a cargo consisting partly of articles, the growth, produce, or manufacture, of the country to which the vessel belongs, and partly of any other merchandize, which the said vessel is permitted to import by the preceding articles, it is agreed that, in case a cargo should be thus mixed, the vessel shall always pay the duties, imposts, and charges, according to the nature of that part of the cargo which is subjected to the highest duties, in the same manner as if the vessel imported this sort of merchandise only.

Consuls, &c. Proceedings against consuls, &c. offending against the laws.
Archives, &c. inviolate.
Consuls and their deputies to have the right to act as judges, &c. Limitation of the right.

ARTICLE 5.
The high contracting parties grant mutually the liberty of having in the places of commerce and ports of the other, consuls, vice consuls, or commercial agents, who shall enjoy all the protection and assistance necessary for the due discharge of their functions. But it is here expressly declared, that in case of illegal or improper conduct in respect to the laws or government of the country to which they are sent, the said consul, vice consul, or agent, may be either punished according to law, dismissed, or sent away, by the offended government, that government assigning to the other the reasons therefor. It is, nevertheless, understood, that the archives and documents relative to the affairs of the consulate shall be protected from all examination, and shall be carefully preserved, being placed under the seal of the consul and of the authority of the place where he shall have resided.
The consuls and their deputies shall have the right, as such, to act as judges and arbitrators in the differences which may arise between the captains and crews of the vessels of the nation whose affairs are entrusted to their care. The respective governments shall have no right to interfere in matters of this kind, except the conduct of the captain and crew shall disturb the peace and tranquillity of the country in which the vessel may be, or that the consul of the place shall feel himself obliged to resort to the interposition and support of the executive authority to cause his decision to be respected and maintained. It being, nevertheless, understood, that this kind of judgment, or award, shall not deprive the contending parties of the right which they shall have, on their return, to recur to the judicial authorities of their own country.

(* This article not ratified.)

ARTICLE 6.* In order to prevent all dispute and uncertainty in respect to what may be considered as being the growth, produce, or manufacture, of the contracting parties respectively, it is agreed, that whatever the chief or intendant of the customs shall have designated and specified as such, in the clearance delivered to the vessels which depart from the European ports of his Majesty the King of Sweden and Norway, shall be acknowledged and admitted as such in the United States; and that, in the same manner, whatever the chief or collector of the customs in the ports of the United States shall have designated and specified as the growth, produce, or manufacture, of the United States, shall be acknowledged and admitted as such in the territories of his Majesty the King of Sweden and Norway. The specification or designation given by the chief of the customs in

lors il ne sera paye ni pour les dits vaisseaux ni pour les cargaisons de droits, impots ou charges quelconques plus forts ou autres que ceux qui seraient payes par des vaisseaux des Etats Unis dans le meme cas, avec une addition de dix pour cent sur les dits droits, impots ou charges, et pas davantage.
Afin de prevenir toute incertitude a 1'egard des droits, impots ou charges quelconques que devrait payer un vaisseau appartenant aux citoyens ou sujets de I'une des parties contractantes et arrivant dans les ports de 1'autre avec une cargaison qui consisterait en partie des produits du sol ou des manufactures du pays, auquel le vaisseau appartiendrait, et en partie de quelques autres marchandises, dont 1'importation est permise au dit vaisseau par les articles precedens, il est convenu qu'en cas d'une cargaison ainsi melee, le dit vaisseau payera toujours les droits, impots ou charges suivant la nature de cette partie de la cargaison qui est sujette aux plus gros droits, tout comme si le vaisseau n'eut apporte que cette seule espece de marchandises.

ARTICLE CINQUIEME.
Les hautes parties contractantes s'accordent mutuellement la faculte d'entretenir dans les ports et places de commerce de 1'autre, des consuls, vice-consuls ou agents de commerce, qui jouiront de toute la protection et assistance necessaire pour remplir duement leurs fonctions, mais il est ici expressement declare, que dans le cas d'une conduite illegale ou impropre envers les lois ou le gouvernement du pays auquel il est envoye le dit consul, vice consul ou agent, pourra, ou etre puni conformement aux loix, ou etre mis hors de fonction ou renvoye par le gouvernement offense, celui-ci en donnant les raisons a 1'autre, bien entendu cependant que les archives et documens relatifs aux affaires du consulat, seront a 1'abri de toute recherche et devront etre soigneusement conserves, etant mis sous le seelie du dit consul et de 1'autorite de 1'endroit ou. il aura reside.
Les consuls ou leurs suppleans auront le droit comme tels de servir de juges et d'arbitres dans les differends qui pourraient s'elever entre les capitaines et les equipages des vaisseaux de la nation dont les affaires sont confiees a leurs soins. Les gouvernemens respectifs n'auront le droit de se meler de ces sortes d'affaires qu'en tant que la conduite des equipages ou du capitaine troublerait 1'ordre et la tranquilite dans le pays ou le vaisseau se trouve, ou que le consul du lieu se verrait oblige d'appeller 1'intervention du pouvoir executif pour faire respecter ou maintenir sa decision. Bien entendu que cette espece de jugement ou d'arbitrage ne saurait pourtant priver les parties contendantes du droit qu'elles ont a leur retour de recourir aux autorites judiciaires de leur patrie.

ARTICLE SIXIEME. Afin de prevenir toute dispute ou incertitude a 1'egard de ce qui devra etre repute comme etant le produit du sol ou des manufactures des parties contractantes respectivement, il est convenu que ce qui aura ete designe ou specific comme tel dans 1'expedition que le chef ou 1'intendant de la douane aura donnee aux vaisseaux qui sortiront des ports Europeens des etats de sa Majeste le Roi de Suede et de Norvege, sera reconnu et admis comme tel dans les Etats Unis, et que de meme ce que le chef ou collecteur de la douane dans les ports des Etats Unis aura designe et specific comme etant le produit du sol ou des manufactures des Etats Unis, sera admis et reconnu comme tel dans les Etats de sa Majeste le Roi de Suede et de Norvege.

Vessels and cargoes may enter ports, &c. on paying pilotage, quayage, &c. if those charges have been incurred.
Limitation of this privilege.

ARTICLE 7. The citizens or subjects of one of the contracting parties, arriving with their vessels on any coast belonging to the other, but not willing to enter into port, or being entered into port, and not willing to unload or break bulk, shall have liberty to depart, and to pursue their voyage, without molestation, and without being obliged to render account of their cargo, or to pay any duties, imposts, or charges, whatsoever, on the vessels or cargo, excepting only the dues of pilotage, when a pilot shall have been employed, or those of quayage, or light money, whenever these dues are paid in the same circumstances by the citizens or subjects of the country. It being, nevertheless, understood, that whenever the vessels belonging to the citizens or subjects of one of the contracting parties shall be within the jurisdiction of the other, they shall conform to the laws and regulations concerning navigation, and the places and ports into which it may be permitted to enter, which are in force with regard to the citizens or subjects of the country; and it shall be lawful for the officers of the customs in the district where the said vessels may be, to visit them, to remain on board, and to take such precautions as may be necessary to prevent all illicit commerce while such vessels remain within the said jurisdiction.

Vessels may land part of their cargoes, and proceed with the remainder, on paying the proportional duties, &c.
Exception as to vessels.

ARTICLE 8. It is also agreed, that the vessels of one of the contracting parties, entering the ports of the other, shall be permitted to discharge a part only of their cargoes, whenever the captain or owner shall desire so to do, and they shall be allowed to depart freely with the remainder, without paying any duties, imposts, or charges whatsoever, except on that part which shall have been landed, and which shall be marked and noted on the list or manifest containing the enumeration of the merchandise which the vessel ought to have on board, and which list ought always to be presented, without reservation, to the officers of the customs at the place where the vessel shall have arrived; and nothing shall be paid on the part of the cargo which the vessel takes away; and the said vessel may proceed therewith to my other port or ports in the same country, into which vessels of the most favoured nations are permitted to enter, and there dispose of the same; or the said vessel may depart therewith to the ports of any other country. It is, however, understood, that the duties, imposts, or charges, which are payable on the vessel itself, ought to be paid at the first port where it breaks bulk and discharges a part of the cargo, and that no such duties or impositions shall be again demanded in the ports of the same country where the said vessel may thereafter enter, except the inhabitants of the country be subjected to further duties in the same circumstances.

Rights and privileges of entrepot.

ARTICLE 9. The citizens or subjects of one of the contracting parties, shall enjoy in the ports of the other, as well for their vessels as for their merchandise, all the rights and privileges of entrepot, which are enjoyed by the most favoured nations in the same ports.

ARTICLE HUITIEME. Il est aussi convenu, que les vaisseaux de 1'une des parties contractantes, etant entres dans les ports de 1'autre, ils pourront se borner a ne deecharger qu'une partie de leur cargaison selon que le capitaine ou proprietare le desire, et qu'ils pourront s'en alter librement avec le reste de la cargaison sans payer de droits, impots ou charges quelconques que pour la partie qui aura ete mise a terre et qui sera marquee et biffee sur la liste ou le manifesto contenant 1'enumeration des effets que le vaisseau aura du. apporter laquelle liste devra toujours etre presentee en entier a la douane au lieu ou le vaisseau aura aborde.
