have most generously responded to the cry for help whenever such an appeal has reached them : Therefore be it

claratory statement for these lands on or after said date. Each ap-

plication to make homestead entry and each declaratory statement filed
in person must be sworn to by the applicant before the Register or the Receiver of the United States land office for the district in which

the lands are situated, or before a United States Commissioner, or a

judge or a clerk of a court of record residing in the county in which the land is situated , or before any such officer who resides outside the

county and in the land district and is nearest or most accessible to the land. The agent's affidavit to each declaratory statement filed by agent must be sworn to by the agent before one of such officers on or after May 3, 1915, but the power of attorney ap-

pointing the agent may be sworn to by the declarant on or after April 1, 1915, before any officer in the United States having a seal and authority to administer oaths. After applications have been so sworn to, they must be presented to the Register and Receiver of the

by the proper Register and Receiver on or after May 3 , 1915 , and on or before May 17, 1915, will be treated as filed simultaneously, and where there is no conflict such applications and statements, if in proper form and accompanied by the required payment, will be allowed on May 19, 1915. If such applications or statements conflict in whole or in part, the right of the respective applicants will be determined by public drawings , to be conducted by or under the supervision of the Superintendent of Openings and Sales of Indian Reservations . A drawing will be conducted for lands in North Dakota at the United States land office for the district in which the

lands are situated, beginning at 10 o'clock, a. m. , on May 19, 1915, and for lands in South Dakota at the United States land office for

the district in which the lands are situated, beginning at 10 o'clock, a. m. , on May 21 , 1915. The names of the persons who presented the conflicting applications and statements will be written on cards
and these cards shall be placed in envelopes upon which there are no distinctive or identifying marks. These envelopes shall be thoroughly and impartially mixed, and, after being mixed, shall be drawn one at a time by some disinterested person . As the envelopes are drawn the cards shall be removed, numbered beginning with number one, and fastened to the applications of the proper persons,

which shall be the order in which the applications and statements tiAocnst.ion on applice shall be acted upon and disposed of. If homestead application or

declaratory statement cannot be allowed for any part of the land applied for, it shall be rejected. If it may be allowed for part of, but not for all, the land applied for, the applicant, or the declarant through his agent, shall be allowed thirty days from receipt of notice within which to notify the Register and Receiver what disposition to make thereof. During such time, he may request that the application or statement be allowed for the land not in conflict and rejected as to the land in conflict, or that it be rejected as to all the land applied for ; or he may apply to have the application or statement amended to include other land which is subject to entry and to inclusion in his application or statement , provided he is the prior applicant. If it is determined by the drawing that a declaratory statement shall be acted upon and disposed of before a homestead application for the same land, the homestead applicant shall be allowed thirty days from receipt of notice within which to advise
the Register and Receiver whether to allow or to reject the application . If an applicant or a declarant or his agent, fails to notify the Register and Receiver within the time allowed what disposition to make of the application or statement, it will be rejected as to all the land applied for. Homestead applications and declaratory statements which are presented after May 17, 1915 , will be received and

noted in the order of their filing, and will be acted upon and disposed

of in the usual manner after all such applications and statements

presented on or before that date have been acted upon and disposed of.

Disposition of mon-

eys .

4. Disposition of Moneys. Moneys tendered with applications and

statements presented on or before May 17, 1915, except fees for filing declaratory statements, will be deposited by the Receiver of the

proper land office to his official credit and properly accounted for.

PROCLAMATIONS, 1915 .

1723

The fee for filing a declaratory statement must be paid even though the application is rejected, and such fee will be properly applied when the statement is filed . When a homestead application is allowed in

whole or in part, the sums required as fees, commissions and purchase money will be properly applied , and any sum in excess of the required amount will be returned to the applicant. When a declaratory state-

ment is allowed in whole or in part, the sum which will be required as purchase money if entry is made under the declaratory statement will be held until entry has been allowed under the statement or the time

has expired within which entry may be made and any sum in excess of the required amount will be returned to the declarant. The moneys held will not be returned until the time has expired within which entry may be made under the statement but will be returned

as soon as possible thereafter if entry is not made. Moneys tendered with applications and statements which are rejected in whole, except fees for filing declaratory statements, will be returned. If an applicant or declarant fails to secure all the land applied for and amends his application or statement to embrace other lands, the moneys theretofore tendered will be applied on account of the required pay-

ment under the amended application. If it is not sufficient, the applicant or declarant will be required to pay the deficiency , and if it is more than sufficient, the excess will be returned. Moneys returned to applicants or declarants will be returned by the official check of

the Receiver of the proper United States land office. Moneys tendered with applications or statements presented after May 17, 1915, will be deposited by the Receiver of the proper land office in the usual manner.
5. Price of Lands. Lands entered or filed upon prior to August 19, 1915 , must be paid for at the rate of $5 per acre ; those entered or filed upon on or after that date and prior to November 19 , 1915 , at the rate of $3.50 per acre ; and those entered or filed upon on or after November 19 , 1915, at the rate of $2.50 per acre.

which is not required when entry is made, may be paid in five equal installments, the first within two years from the date of entry and the remainder annually in three, four, five and six years, respectively, thereafter, unless commutation proof is submitted. If commutation proof is submitted, final payment must be made at that time. If three-year proof is submitted, final payment may be made then or at any time thereafter before the payments become due in the annual installments. Neither final certificate nor patent will issue under a three-year proof until final payment of purchase money has been made.
8. Forfeitures. If an entryman fails to make any payment when it

States by the armed vessels of a belligerent, whether public ships or

privateers, for the purpose of preparing for hostile operations, or as

posts of observation upon the ships of war or privateers or merchant vessels of a belligerent lying within or being about to enter the jurisdiction of the United States, must be regarded as unfriendly and offensive, and in violation of that neutrality which it is the determination of this government to observe ; and to the end that the hazard

and inconvenience of such apprehended practices may be avoided,

I further proclaim and declare that from and after the twenty-fifth

day of May instant, and during the continuance of the present hostilities, no ship of war or privateer of any belligerent shall be permitted

to make use of any port, harbor, roadstead or other waters within

the jurisdiction of the United States as a station or place of resort for any warlike purpose or for the purpose of obtaining any facilities of

warlike equipment; and no ship of war or privateer of either bellig-

erent shall be permitted to sail out of or leave any port, harbor, roadstead, or waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States from

which a vessel of an opposing belligerent (whether the same shall be

a ship of war, a privateer, or a merchant ship) shall have previously departed, until after the expiration of at least twenty-four hours

from the departure of such last-mentioned vessel beyond the jurisdiction of the United States. If any ship of war or privateer of a

belligerent shall, after the time this notification takes effect, enter any port, harbor, roadstead, or waters of the United States, such

vessel shall be required to depart and to put to sea within twenty-four hours after her entrance into such port, harbor, roadstead , or waters,

except in case of stress of weather or of her requiring provisions or

things necessary for the subsistence of her crew, or for repairs ; in any

of which cases the authorities of the port or of the nearest port (as

the case may be) shall require her to put to sea as soon as possible

after the expiration of such period of twenty-four hours, without

permitting her to take in supplies beyond what may be necessary for her immediate use ; and no such vessel which may have been permitted to remain within the waters of the United States for the purpose of repair shall continue within such port, harbor, roadstead, or

waters for a longer period than twenty-four hours after her necessary repairs shall have been completed , unless within such twenty-four

hours a vessel, whether ship of war, privateer, or merchant ship of an

opposing belligerent, shall have departed therefrom, in which case

the time limited for the departure of such ship of war or privateer shall be extended so far as may be necessary to secure an interval of

not less than twenty-four hours between such departure and that of

States more than twenty-four hours, by reason of the successive

departures from such port, harbor, roadstead, or waters of more than one vessel of an opposing belligerent. But if there be several vessels

of opposing belligerents in the same port, harbor, roadstead, or

waters, the order of their departure therefrom shall be so arranged as to afford the opportunity of leaving alternately to the vessels of the opposing belligerents, and to cause the least detention consistent

with the objects of this proclamation. No ship of war or privateer

of a belligerent shall be permitted , while in any port, harbor, roadstead, or waters within the jurisdiction of the United States, to take

in any supplies except provisions and such other things as may be

requisite for the subsistence of here crew, and except so much coal only as may be sufficient to carry such vessel, if without any sail power, to the nearest port of her own country; or in case the vessel

is rigged to go under sail, and may also be propelled by steam power, then with half the quantity of coal which she would be entitled to receive, if dependent upon steam alone, and no coal shall be again sup-

plied to any such ship of war or privateer in the same or any other

port, harbor, roadstead, or waters of the United States, without special permission, until after the expiration of three months from the time

when such coal may have been last supplied to her within the waters

action of Congress in this matter indicates very happily the desire of the nation, as well as of the people of Virginia, to encourage the

Negro in his efforts to solve his industrial problem. The National

Commended to the Negro Exposition is designed to demonstrate his progress in the last ancattiivoen. interest of the fifty years and to emphasize his opportunities. As President of the
United States, I bespeak the active interest of the nation in the

exposition and trust that every facility will be extended to the leaders whose earnest work has made the undertaking possible.

In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.

enter the jurisdiction of the United States, must be regarded as

unfriendly and offensive, and in violation of that neutrality which it is the determination of this government to observe; and to the end

that the hazard and inconvenience of such apprehended practices may be avoided , I further proclaim and declare that from and after the twenty-fourth day of August instant, and during the continuance

of the present hostilities , no ship of war or privateer of any bellig-

station or place of resort for any warlike purpose or for the purpose

of obtaining any facilities of warlike equipment ; and no ship of war or privateer of either belligerent shall be permitted to sail out of or

erent (whether the same shall be a ship of war, a privateer, or a

merchant ship) shall have previously departed, until after the expiration of at least twenty-four hours from the departure of such last-

mentioned vessel beyond the jurisdiction of the United States. If any ship of war or privateer of a belligerent shall, after the time this

notification takes effect, enter any port, harbor, roadstead , or waters of the United States, such vessel shall be required to depart and to

put to sea within twenty-four hours after her entrance into such

port, harbor, roadstead , or waters , except in case of stress of weather or of her requiring provisions or things necessary for the subsistence of her crew, or for repairs ; in any of which cases the authorities of

the port or of the nearest port (as the case may be) shall require her to put to sea as soon as possible after the expiration of such period of twenty-four hours, without permitting her to take in supplies beyond what may be necessary for her immediate use ; and no such

vessel which may have been permitted to remain within the waters

of the United States for the purpose of repair shall continue within such port, harbor, roadstead, or waters for a longer period than twenty-four hours after her necessary repairs shall have been completed, unless within such twenty-four hours a vessel, whether ship

of war, privateer, or merchant ship of an opposing belligerent, shall have departed therefrom, in which case the time limited for the de-

parture of such ship of war or privateer shall be extended so far as may be necessary to secure an interval of not less than twenty-four hours between such departure and that of any ship of war, privateer,

or merchant ship of an opposing belligerent which may have previously quit the same port, harbor, roadstead, or waters. No ship of war or

privateer of a belligerent shall be detained in any port, harbor, roadstead, or waters of the United States more than twenty-four hours, by

reason of the successive departures from such port, harbor, roadstead, or waters of more than one vessel of an opposing belligerent. But if there be several vessels of opposing belligerents in the same port, harbor, roadstead, or waters, the order of their departure therefrom

shall be so arranged as to afford the opportunity of leaving alternately to the vessels of the opposing belligerents, and to cause the least detention consistent with the objects of this proclamation.

No ship of war or privateer of a belligerent shall be permitted,

while in any port, harbor, roadstead, or waters within the jurisdiction of the United States, to take in any supplies except provisions

and such other things as may be requisite for the subsistence of her crew, and except so much coal only as may be sufficient to carry

such vessel, if without any sail power, to the nearest port of her own country; or in case the vessel is rigged to go under sail, and may also be propelled by steam power, then with half the quantity of coal which she would be entitled to receive, if dependent upon steam

alone, and no coal shall be again supplied to any such ship of war or

privateer in the same or any other port, harbor, roadstead, or waters

of the United States, without special permission , until after the expiration of three months from the time when such coal may have been last supplied to her within the waters of the United States,

unless such ship of war or privateer shall, since last thus supplied,

have entered a port of the government to which she belongs.

the United States land office at Dodge City, Kansas, beginning at ten

o'clock a. m. on December 1 , 1915. The names of the persons who presented the conflicting applications and statements will be written

If an applicant, or a declarant or his agent, in such cases fails to notify the Register and Receiver within the time allowed what disposition to make of the application or statement , it will be rejected as to all the land applied for.

Thanksgiving 1915.
Preamble.

Day, It has long been the honoured custom of our people to turn in the
fruitful autumn of the year in praise and thanksgiving to Almighty
God for his many blessings and mercies to us as a nation . The year that is now drawing to a close since we last observed our day of national thanksgiving has been, while a year of discipline because of the
mighty forces of war and of change which have disturbed the world,
also a year of special blessing for us. Another year of peace has been vouchsafed us ; another year in
which not only to take thought of our duty to ourselves and to mankind but also to adjust ourselves to the many responsibilities thrust upon us by a war which has involved almost the whole of Europe.

PROCLAMATIONS, 1915.

1757

We have been able to assert our rights and the rights of mankind

without breach of friendship with the great nations with whom we have had to deal; and while we have asserted rights we have been

able also to perform duties and exercise privileges of succour and helpfulness which should serve to demonstrate our desire to make the offices of friendship the means of truly disinterested and unselfish service. Our ability to serve all who could avail themselves of our services in the midst of crisis has been increased, by a gracious

Providence, by more and more abundant crops ; our ample financial resources have enabled us to steady the markets of the world and

facilitate necessary movements of commerce which the war might otherwise have rendered impossible ; and our people have come more and more to a sober realization of the part they have been called upon

to play in a time when all the world is shaken by unparalleled distresses and disasters. The extraordinary circumstances of such a

time have done much to quicken our national consciousness and

deepen and confirm our confidence in the principles of peace and

freedom by which we have always sought to be guided. Out of darkness and perplexity have come firmer counsels of policy and clearer perceptions of the essential welfare of the nation. We have

prospered while other peoples were at war, but our prosperity has been vouchsafed us, we believe, only that we might the better per-

form the functions which war rendered it impossible for them to

perform .

WHEREAS a state of war unhappily exists between Germany

and Portugal;

And Whereas the United States is on terms of friendship and

amity with the contending powers, and with the persons inhabiting their several dominions ;

And Whereas there are citizens of the United States residing within the territories or dominions of each of the said belligerents and carrying on commerce, trade, or other business or pursuits therein ;
And Whereas there are subjects of each of the said belligerents residing within the territory or jurisdiction of the United States, and carrying on commerce, trade, or other business or pursuits therein;
And Whereas the laws and treaties of the United States, without

interfering with the free expression of opinion and sympathy, or with the commercial manufacture or sale of arms or munitions of war,

nevertheless impose upon all persons who may be within their terri-

tory and jurisdiction the duty of an impartial neutrality during the existence of the contest ;

And Whereas it is the duty of a neutral government not to per-

mit or suffer the making of its waters subservient to the purposes of

Now, Therefore, I, Woodrow Wilson, President of the United

States and of its citizens and of persons within its territory and jurisdiction, and to enforce its laws and treaties, and in order that all

persons, being warned of the general tenor of the laws and treaties of

the United States in this behalf, and of the law of nations, may thus

be prevented from any violation of the same, do hereby declare and

8. Fitting out and arming, or attempting to fit out and arm, or procuring to be fitted out and armed, or knowingly being concerned in the furnishing, fitting out, or arming of any ship or vessel with intent that such ship or vessel shall be employed in the service of either of the said belligerents.

or belonging to the subjects of either, by adding to the number of guns of such vessels, or by changing those on board of her for guns of a larger calibre, or by the addition thereto of any equipment solely applicable to war.
11. Beginning or setting on foot or providing or preparing the means for any military expedition or enterprise to be carried on from
the territory or jurisdiction of the United States against the territories or dominions of either of the said belligerents .
And I do hereby further declare and proclaim that any frequenting ligNearvenatls.vessels of beland use of the waters within the territorial jurisdiction of the United terRreisttorriiacltiwoantserso.n, in States by the armed vessels of a belligerent , whether public ships or privateers, for the purpose of preparing for hostile operations, or as posts of observation upon the ships of war or privateers or merchant vessels of a belligerent lying within or being about to enter the jurisdiction of the United States, must be regarded as unfriendly and offensive, and in violation of that neutrality which it is the determination of this government to observe; and to the end that the hazard and inconvenience of such apprehended practices may be avoided , I further proclaim and declare that from and after the thirteenth of March, instant, and during the continuance of the present hostilities, no ship of war or privateer of any belligerent shall be permitted to make use of any port, harbor, roadstead or other waters within the jurisdiction of the United States as a station or place of resort for any warlike purpose or for the purpose of obtaining any facilities of warlike equipment ; and no ship of war or privateer of either belligerent shall be permitted to sail out of or leave any port, harbor, roadstead, or waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States from which a vessel of an opposing belligerent (whether the same shall be a ship of war, a privateer, or a merchant ship) shall have previously departed, until after the expiration of at least twentyfour hours from the departure of such last-mentioned vessel beyond the jurisdiction of the United States. If any ship of war or privateer of a belligerent shall, after the time this notification takes effect, enter any port, harbor, roadstead, or waters of the United States,
such vessel shall be required to depart and to put to sea within

1772

PROCLAMATIONS, 1916.

twenty-four hours after her entrance into such port, harbor, roadstead, or waters, except in case of stress of weather or of her requiring provisions or things necessary for the subsistence of her crew, or for

repairs; in any of which cases the authorities of the port or of the

nearest port (as the case may be) shall require her to put to sea as soon as possible after the expiration of such period of twenty-four hours, without permitting her to take in supplies beyond what may be necessary for her immediate use; and no such vessel which may have been permitted to remain within the waters of the United States.

for the purpose of repair shall continue within such port, harbor, roadstead, or waters for a longer period than twenty-four hours after her necessary repairs shall have been completed, unless within such

twenty-four hours a vessel, whether ship of war, privateer, or merchant ship of an opposing belligerent, shall have departed therefrom, in which case the time limited for the departure of such ship of war or privateer shall be extended so far as may be necessary to secure an interval of not less than twenty-four hours between such departure and that of any ship of war, privateer, or merchant ship of an opposing belligerent which may have previously quit the same

port, harbor, roadstead , or waters. No ship of war or privateer of a belligerent shall be detained in any port, harbor, roadstead, or waters

of the United States more than twenty-four hours, by reason of the successive departures from such port, harbor, roadstead, or waters of

more than one vessel of an opposing belligerent. But if there be several vessels of opposing belligerents in the same port, harbor, roadstead, or waters, the order of their departure therefrom shall

be so arranged as to afford the opportunity of leaving alternately to the vessels of the opposing belligerents, and to cause the least detention consistent with the objects of this proclamation. No ship of war

or privateer of a belligerent shall be permitted, while in any port, harbor, roadstead, or waters within the jurisdiction of the United States , to take in any supplies except provisions and such other things

as may be requisite for the subsistence of her crew, and except so
much coal only as may be sufficient to carry such vessel, if without any sail power, to the nearest port of her own country ; or in case the

vessel is rigged to go under sail, and may also be propelled by steam power, then with half the quantity of coal which she would be entitled to receive, if dependent upon steam alone, and no coal shall

be again supplied to any such ship of war or privateer in the same or any other port, harbor, roadstead, or waters of the United States,

without special permission, until after the expiration of three months

from the time when such coal may have been last supplied to her

within the waters of the United States, unless such ship of war or

privateer shall, since last thus supplied, have entered a port of the

government to which she belongs.

Strict neutrality to be maintained.

And I do further declare and proclaim that the statutes and the

treaties of the United States and the law of nations alike require that no person, within the territory and jurisdiction of the United

States, shall take part, directly or indirectly, in the said wars, but

shall remain at peace with all of the said belligerents, and shall

maintain a strict and impartial neutrality. Observance of laws And I do hereby enjoin all citizens of the United States, and all enjoined.

And I do hereby warn all citizens of the United States, and all

persons residing or being within its territory or jurisdiction that,

And I do hereby give notice that all citizens of the United States Notice. and others who may claim the protection of this government , who may misconduct themselves in the premises, will do so at their peril, and that they can in no wise obtain any protection from the Government of the United States against the consequences of their misconduct.

Flag day. Celebration

of an-

My Fellow Countrymen : Many circumstances have recently con-

nUinvietresdarSytaotfesafdlaogp.ting spired to turn our thoughts to a critical examination of the conditions of our national life, of the influences which have seemed to

threaten to divide us in interest and sympathy, of forces within and forces without that seemed likely to draw us away from the happy

traditions of united purpose and action of which we have been so proud. It has therefore seemed to me fitting that I should call your attention to the approach of the anniversary of the day upon which

the flag of the United States was adopted by the Congress as the em-

blem of the Union, and to suggest to you that it should this year and

in the years to come be given special significance as a day of renewal

and reminder, a day upon which we should direct our minds with a

special desire of renewal to thoughts of the ideals and principles of

which we have sought to make our great Government the embodi-

ment.

General observance

with patriotic exercises I therefore suggest and request that throughout the nation and if

requested.

possible in every community the fourteenth day of June be observed as

FLAG DAY with special patriotic exercises, at which means shall be taken to give significant expression to our thoughtful love of America, our comprehension of the great mission of liberty and justice to which we have devoted ourselves as a people, our pride in the history and our enthusiasm for the political programme of the nation, our determination to make it greater and purer with each generation, and our resolution to demonstrate to all the world its vital union in sentiment and

purpose, accepting only those as true compatriots who feel as we do

compulsion of this supreme allegiance. Let us on that day rededicate

ourselves to the nation , "one and inseparable ", from which every thought that is not worthy of our fathers' first vows of independence, liberty, and right shall be excluded and in which we shall stand with united hearts, for an America which no man can corrupt, no

influence draw away from its ideals, no force divide against itself,-a nation signally distinguished among all the nations of mankind for its clear, individual conception alike of its duties and its privileges, its obligations and its rights.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.

War between Ger-

many and Italy.

WHEREAS a state of war unhappily exists between Germany

and Italy; And Whereas the United States is on terms of friendship

and amity with the contending powers, and with the persons inhabit-

ing their several dominions ;

And Whereas there are citizens of the United States residing

within the territories or dominions of each of the said belligerents and carrying on commerce, trade, or other business or pursuits therein ;

And Whereas there are subjects of each of the said belligerents

residing within the territory or jurisdiction of the United States, and carrying on commerce, trade, or other business or pursuits therein ;

And Whereas the laws and treaties of the United States, without

interfering with the free expression of opinion and sympathy, or with the commercial manufacture or sale of arms or munitions of war,

nevertheless impose upon all persons who may be within their terri-

tory and jurisdiction the duty of an impartial neutrality during the existence of the contest ;

And Whereas it is the duty of a neutral government not to per-

mit or suffer the making of its waters subservient to the purposes of

war;

Declaration of neutrality.

Now, Therefore, I, Woodrow Wilson, President of the United

States of America, in order to preserve the neutrality of the United

States and of its citizens and of persons within its territory and jurisdiction, and to enforce its laws and treaties, and in order that all persons, being warned of the general tenor of the laws and treaties of the

United States in this behalf, and of the law of nations, may thus be

prevented from any violation of the same, do hereby declare and pro-

8. Fitting out and arming, or attempting to fit out and arm, or

procuring to be fitted out and armed, or knowingly being concerned in the furnishing, fitting out, or arming of any ship or vessel with intent that such ship or vessel shall be employed in the service of either of the said belligerents.

guns of such vessels, or by changing those on board of her for guns

of a larger calibre, or by the addition thereto of any equipment solely applicable to war.

11. Beginning or setting on foot or providing or preparing the means for any military expedition or enterprise to be carried on

from the territory or jurisdiction of the United States against the territories or dominions of either of the said belligerents.
And I do hereby further declare and proclaim that any frequenting liNgearvenatls.vessels of beland use of the waters within the territorial jurisdiction of the United terRreisttorriiacltiwoantserso.n, in States by the armed vessels of a belligerent , whether public ships or privateers, for the purpose of preparing for hostile operations, or as
posts of observation upon the ships of war or privateers or merchant vessels of a belligerent lying within or being about to enter the jurisdiction of the United States, must be regarded as unfriendly and offensive, and in violation of that neutrality which it is the determination of this government to observe; and to the end that the haz-
ard and inconvenience of such apprehended practices may be avoided, I further proclaim and declare that from and after the
thirtieth of August, instant, and during the continuance of the present hostilities, no ship of war or privateer of either belligerent shall
be permitted to make use of any port, harbor, roadstead or other
waters within the jurisdiction of the United States as a station or place of resort for any warlike purpose or for the purpose of obtain-
ing any facilities of warlike equipment ; and no ship of war or privateer of either belligerent shall be permitted to sail out of or leave any port, harbor, roadstead, or waters subject to the jurisdiction of

the United States from which a vessel of an opposing belligerent

(whether the same shall be a ship of war, a privateer, or a merchant

ship) shall have previously departed, until after the expiration of at least twenty-four hours from the departure of such last-mentioned vessel beyond the jurisdiction of the United States . If any ship of war or privateer of a belligerent shall, after the time this notification

takes effect, enter any port, harbor, roadstead, or waters of the United

States, such vessel shall be required to depart and to put to sea within

twenty-four hours after her entrance into such port, harbor, road-

stead, or waters, except in case of stress of weather or of her requiring provisions or things necessary for the subsistence of her crew, or for repairs ; in any of which cases the authorities of the port or of the

nearest port (as the case may be) shall require her to put to sea as soon as possible after the expiration of such period of twenty-four hours,
without permitting her to take in supplies beyond what may be necessary for her immediate use ; and no such vessel which may have

been permitted to remain within the waters of the United States for

the purpose of repair shall continue within such port, harbor, roadstead, or waters for a longer period than twenty-four hours after her necessary repairs shall have been completed, unless within such

twenty-four hours a vessel, whether ship of war, privateer, or mer-

chant ship of an opposing belligerent, shall have departed therefrom, in which case the time limited for the departure of such ship of war or privateer shall be extended so far as may be necessary to secure an interval of not less than twenty-four hours between such departure and that of any ship of war, privateer, or merchant ship of the opposing belligerent which may have previously quit the same port, harbor, roadstead, or waters. No ship of war or privateer of a belligerent shall be detained in any port, harbor, roadstead , or waters of the United States more than twenty-four hours, by reason of the succes-

sive departures from such port, harbor, roadstead, or waters of more than one vessel of an opposing belligerent. But if there be several vessels of opposing belligerents in the same port, harbor, roadstead,

or waters, the order of their departure therefrom shall be so arranged as to afford the opportunity of leaving alternately to the vessels of the opposing belligerents, and to cause the least detention consistent with the objects of this proclamation. No ship of war or privateer

of a belligerent shall be permitted, while in any port, harbor, roadstead, or waters within the jurisdiction of the United States, to take in any supplies except provisions and such other things as may be

requisite for the subsistence of her crew, and except so much coal only as may be sufficient to carry such vessel, if without any sail power, to the nearest port of her own country; or in case the vessel

is rigged to go under sail, and may also be propelled by steam power, then with half the quantity of coal which she would be entitled to receive, if dependent upon steam alone, and no coal shall be again supplied to any such ship of war or privateer in the same or any other port, harbor, roadstead, or waters of the United States, without special permission, until after the expiration of three months from the

time when such coal may have been last supplied to her within the waters of the United States , unless such ship of war or privateer shall,

since last thus supplied, have entered a port of the government to

which she belongs.

Strict neutrality to

be maintained.

And I do further declare and proclaim that the statutes and the

treaties of the United States and the law of nations alike require that

no person, within the territory and jurisdiction of the United States,

shall take part, directly or indirectly, in the said wars , but shall re-

main at peace with both of the said belligerents, and shall maintain

a strict and impartial neutrality.

Observance of laws

And I do hereby give notice that all citizens of the United States and Notice. others who may claim the protection of this government, who may misconduct themselves in the premises, will do so at their peril, and that they can in no wise obtain any protection from the government of the United States against the consequences of their misconduct.

ritRoersitalriwcattieornso.n, in ter- and use of the waters within the territorial jurisdiction of the United

States by the armed vessels of a belligerent, whether public ships or

privateers, for the purpose of preparing for hostile operations, or as

posts of observation upon the ships of war or privateers or merchant vessels of a belligerent lying within or being about to enter the juris-

diction of the United States, must be regarded as unfriendly and offensive, and in violation of that neutrality which it is the determination of this government to observe ; and to the end that the hazard

and inconvenience of such apprehended practices may be avoided, I further proclaim and declare that from and after the 18th of Septem-

ber, instant, and during the continuance of the present hostilities,

no ship of war or privateer of any belligerent shall be permitted to make use of any port, harbor, roadstead or other waters within the

jurisdiction of the United States as a station or place of resort for any warlike purpose or for the purpose of obtaining any facilities of

warlike equipment ; and no ship of war or privateer of any belligerent shall be permitted to sail out of or leave any port, harbor, roadstead, or waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States from which

a vessel of an opposing belligerent (whether the same shall be a

ship of war, a privateer, or a merchant ship) shall have previously departed, until after the expiration of at least twenty- four hours from the departure of such last-mentioned vessel beyond the jurisdiction of the United States . If any ship of war or privateer of a belligerent

shall, after the time this notification takes effect, enter any port, harbor, roadstead, or waters of the United States, such vessel shall be

required to depart and to put to sea within twenty-four hours after her entrance into such port, harbor, roadstead, or waters, except in

repair shall continue within such port, harbor, roadstead, or waters for a longer period than tweny-four hours after her necessary repairs shall have been completed, unless within such twenty-four hours a vessel, whether ship of war, privateer, or merchant ship of an opposing belligerent, shall have departed therefrom, in which case the time
limited for the departure of such ship of war or privateer shall be extended so far as may be necessary to secure an interval of not less than twenty-four hours between such departure and that of any ship of war, privateer, or merchant ship of an opposing belligerent which may have previously quit the same port, harbor, roadstead , or waters. No ship of war or privateer of a belligerent shall be detained in any port, harbor, roadstead , or waters of the United States more than twenty-four hours, by reason of the successive departures from such port, harbor, roadstead, or waters of more than one vessel of an opposing belligerent. But if there be several vessels of opposing belligerents in the same port, harbor, roadstead, or waters , the order of their

departure therefrom shall be so arranged as to afford the opportunity of leaving alternately to the vessels of the opposing belligerents , and to cause the least detention consistent with the objects of this procla-

mation. No ship of war or privateer of a belligerent shall be per-

mitted, while in any port, harbor, roadstead, or waters within the

jurisdiction of the United States, to take in any supplies except pro-

visions and such other things as may be requisite for the subsistence

of her crew, and except so much coal only as may be sufficient to carry

such vessel, if without any sail power, to the nearest port of her own

country; or in case the vessel is rigged to go under sail, and may also

be propelled by steam power, then with half the quantity of coal which she would be entitled to receive, if dependent upon steam alone,

and no coal shall be again supplied to any such ship ofwar or privateer in the same or any other port, harbor, roadstead, or waters of the

United States, without special permission, until after the expiration

of three months from the time when such coal may have been last

supplied to her within the waters of the United States, unless such ship of war or privateer shall, since last thus supplied, have entered

a port of the government to which she belongs .

Thanksgiving Day, It has long been the custom of our people to turn in the fruitful 1916.

autumn of the year in praise and thanksgiving to Almighty God for His many blessings and mercies to us as a nation. The year that has elapsed since we last observed our day of thanksgiving has been rich in blessings to us as a people, but the whole face of the world has been darkened by war. In the midst of our peace and happiness, our

Preamble.

thoughts dwell with painful disquiet upon the struggles and sufferings of the nations at war and of the peoples upon whom war has brought disaster without choice or possibility of escape on their part.

We can not think of our own happiness without thinking also of their pitiful distress.

Now, therefore, I, WOODROW WILSON, President of the 30,T1h9u1r6s, daappy,oNiontveedmabsear United States of America, do appoint Thursday, the thirtieth of No- day of general thanksvember, as a day of National Thanksgiving and Prayer, and urge and giving.

advise the people to resort to their several places of worship on that day to render thanks to Almighty God for the blessings of peace and unbroken prosperity which He has bestowed upon our beloved country in such unstinted measure. And I also urge and suggest our duty in

this our day of peace and abundance to think in deep sympathy of the stricken peoples of the world upon whom the curse and terror of war

has so pitilessly fallen, and to contribute out of our abundant means to the relief of their suffering. Our people could in no better way show their real attitude towards the present struggle of the nations

than by contributing out of their abundance to the relief of the suffer-
