Each convict, immediately upon being received into the penitentiary, shall be thoroughly cleansed with warm water and soap, and shall have the hair cut close; and the warden and other officers shall take the strictest precautions to guard against the introduction of any infectious or contagious disease, from the persons or clothing of such convicts; which precautions it shall be the duty of the inspectors to regulate, and prescribe in their by-laws. A descriptive list of the names, ages, persons, crimes and sentences of the convict, shall be kept by the warden, and such description shall be entered immediately upon the reception of each convict. The convicts shall be clothed at the public expense during the whole term of their confinement, in habits of coarse and cheap materials, uniform in colour and make, and so striped, or otherwise conspicuously
marked, as may clearly distinguish them from the ordinary dress of other persons. Their bedding,and other personal accommodations, shall be of the cheapest and coarsest kind, consistent with use and durability. The convicts shall be fed on the cheapest food which will support health and strength, with as little change or variety in the said diet, as may be consistent with the health of the convicts, and the economy of the penitentiary. They shall be kept, as far as may be consistent with their age, health, sex, and ability, to labour of the hardest and most servile kind, and as far as may be, uniform in its nature, and of a kind where the work is least liable to be spoiled by ignorance, neglect, or obstinacy,or the materials to be injured, stolen, or destroyed. They shall not, at any time, be permitted to converse with one another, or with strangers, except by the special permission, and in presence of some officer of the prison, as may be regulated by the by-laws; they shall be made to labour diligently, in silence, and with strict obedience.
Sec . 12. And be it further enacted, That the warden of the said
penitentiary shall have power to punish any convict in the penitentiary, who shall wilfully violate, or refuse to obey, the rules of the penitentiary, or to perform the work assigned him, or who shall resist by violence any of the officers of the penitentiary in the exercise of their lawful authority, or shall wilfully destroy any property, tools, or materials; and it shall be the duty of the said warden to inflict such punishment, either by confine-

report shall be duly entered in the same book, and the convict shall return to the ordinary discipline of the penitentiary, so far as may be consistent
with his or her health and strength. Special rules for the order and government of the infirmary, shall be made and enforced by the inspectors, and nothing in this act contained, shall be construed to forbid any such relaxation of the general discipline of the penitentiary, as may be

Sec . 17. And be it further enacted, That the inspectors shall prescribe, and it shall be the duty of the warden rigidly to enforce such rules for the government of the subordinate officers of the penitentiary, as may prevent all tyrannical or violent behaviour to the convicts, or all conversation between them and the convicts, or with each other, within their
hearing, except for necessary purposes, and may best preserve order, silence, sobriety, and gravity of deportment throughout the establishment.

By th e Presi den t o f the Unit ed Stat es of America :

PROCLAMATION:

Proclamation. Ante, p. 308.
Discriminating duties suspended upon Austrian vessels.

Whereas, by an act of the Congress of the United States of the 24th of May,

one thousand eight hundred and twenty-eight, entitled " An Act in addition to

an act, entitled ` An act concerning discriminating duties of Tonnage and Im-

post,' and to equalize the duties on Prussian vessels and their cargoes," it is

provided that, upon satisfactory evidence being given to the President of the

United States, by the government of any foreign nation, that no discriminating

duties of tonnage or impost are imposed or levied in the ports of the said nation,

upon vessels wholly belonging to citizens of the United States, or upon the

produce, manufactures, or merchandise, imported in the same from the United

States, or from any foreign country, the President is thereby authorized to issue

his proclamation declaring that the foreign discriminating duties of tonnage

and impost within the United States are, and shall be, suspended and discon-

tinued, so far as respects the vessels of the said foreign nation, and the pro-

duce, manufactures or merchandise, imported into the United States in the

same from the said foreign nation, or from any other foreign country ; the said

suspension to take effect from the time of such notification being given to the

President of the United States, and to continue so long as the reciprocal exemp-

tion of vessels, belonging to citizens of the United States, and their cargoes, as

aforesaid, shall be continued, and no longer.

And whereas, satisfactory evidence has lately been received by me, from his

Imperial Majesty the Emperor of Austria, through an official communication

of the Baron de Lederer, his Consul General in the United States, under date

of the 29th of May, 1829, that no other or higher duties of tonnage and impost

are imposed or levied since the first day of January last in the ports of Aus-

tria, upon vessels wholly belonging to citizens of the United States, and upon

the produce, manufactures, or merchandise imported in the same from the

United States, and from any foreign country whatever, than are levied on Aus-

trian ships and their cargoes, in the same ports under like circumstances.

Now, therefore, I, Andrew Jackson, President of the United States of

America, do hereby declare and proclaim, that so much of the several acts im-

posing discriminating duties of tonnage and impost within the United States,

are, and shall be, suspended and discontinued, so far as respects the vessels of

Austria, and the produce, manufactures, and merchandise, imported into the

United States in the same, from the dominions of Austria, and from any other

foreign country whatever, the said suspension to take effect from the day above

mentioned, and to continue thenceforward, so long as the reciprocal exemp-

tion of the vessels of the United States, and the produce, manufactures, and

merchandise imported into the dominions of Austria, in the same as aforesaid,

shall be continued on the part of the government of His Imperial Majesty the

Emperor of Austria.

Given under my hand, at the City of Washington, this third day of June,

in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and twenty-nine, and the

fifty-third of the Independence of the United States.

of the United States, and merchandise, as aforesaid, thereon laden, shall be

continued, and no longer. And whereas, satisfactory evidence has been received by me, from His Bri-
tannic Majesty, as King of Hanover, through the Right Honourable Charles Richard Vaughan, his Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary, that

vessels wholly belonging to citizens of the United States, or merchandise, the

produce or manufacture thereof, imported in such vessels, are not, nor shall be, on their entering any Hanoverian port, subject to the payment of higher duties

of tonnage or impost, than are levied on Hanoverian ships, or merchandise, the

produce or manufacture of the United States, imported in such vessels.

Now, therefore, I, John Quincy Adams, President of the United States of America, do hereby declare and proclaim, that so much of the several acts imposing duties on the tonnage of ships and vessels, and on goods, wares and merchandise, imported into the United States as imposed a discriminating duty

of tonnage, between the vessels of the Kingdom of Hanover, and vessels of

the United States, between goods imported into the United States, in vessels of the Kingdom of Hanover, and vessels of the United States, are suspended

and discontinued, so far as the same respect the produce or manufacture of the said Kingdom of Hanover ; the said suspension to take effect this day, and

to continue henceforward so long as the reciprocal exemption of the vessels of

the United States and the merchandise laden therein as aforesaid shall be continued in the ports of the Kingdom of Hanover.

1828, and the fifty-second of the Independence of the United States.

Discriminating duties suspended upon Austrian vessels.
* This should be " third," in-
stead of " second."

Whereas, by an act of the Congress of the United States, of the seventh of January, one thousand eight hundred and twenty-four, entitled " An Act concerning discriminating duties of Tonnage and Impost," it is provided, that

upon satisfactory evidence being given to the President of the United States by the government of any foreign nation, that no discriminating duties of ton-

nage or impost are imposed or levied within the ports of the said nation, upon

vessels belonging wholly to citizens of the United States, or upon merchandise, the produce or manufacture thereof, imported in the same, the President

is thereby authorized to issue his proclamation, declaring that the foreign dis-

criminating duties and impost within the United States are, and shall be, suspended and discontinued, so far as respects the vessels of the said nation, and the merchandise of its produce or manufacture, imported into the United States

in the same ; the said suspension to take effect from the time of such notification being given to the President of the United States, and to continue so long as the reciprocal exemption of vessels belonging to citizens of the United

States, and merchandise, as aforesaid, therein laden, shall be continued, and

no longer.

And whereas, satisfactory evidence has been received by me from His Imperial Majesty, the Emperor of Austria, through the Baron de Lederer, his

Consul General in the United States, that vessels wholly belonging to citizens of the United States are not, nor shall be, on their entering any Austrian port,

from and after the first day of January last, subject to the payment of higher duties of tonnage than are levied on Austrian ships.

Now, therefore, I, Andrew Jackson, President of the United States of Ame-

rica, do hereby declare and proclaim, that so much of the several acts imposing duties on the tonnage of ships arriving in the United States, as imposed a dis-

criminating duty between the vessels of the Empire of Austria and vessels of the United States, are suspended and discontinued ; the said suspension to take

effect from the day above mentioned, and to continue henceforward, so long as

the reciprocal exemption of the vessels of the United States shall be continued in the ports of the imperial dominions of Austria.

Between the United States of America, and his Majesty the Emperor of Austria.
The United States of America, and His Majesty the Emperor of Austria, King of Hungary and Bohemia, equally animated with the desire of maintaining the relations of good understanding which have hitherto so happily subsisted between their respective States, of extending, also, and consolidating the commercial intercourse between them, and convinced that this object cannot better be accomplished than by adopting the system of an entire freedom of navigation, and a perfect reciprocity, based upon principles of equity equally beneficial to both

TREATY WITH AUSTRIA. 1829.

399

countries, have, in consequence, agreed to enter into negotiations for the conclusion of a treaty of commerce and navigation, for which purpose the President of the United States has conferred full powers on Mart in Van Bure n , their Secretary of State; and His Majesty the Emperor of Austria has conferred like powers on Lewi s , Baro n de Lederer , his said Majesty's Consul for the port of New York, and the said Plenipotentiaries having exchanged their said full powers, found in good and due form, have concluded and signed the following articles:
Arti cle I. There shall be between the territories of the high contracting parties a reciprocal liberty of commerce and navigation. The inhabitants of their respective States shall mutually have liberty to enter the ports, places and rivers of the territories of each party, wherever foreign commerce is permitted. They shall be at liberty to sojourn and reside in all parts whatsoever of said territories, in order to attend to their commercial affairs; and they shall enjoy, to that effect, the same security, protection and privileges as natives of the country wherein they reside, on condition of their submitting to the laws and ordinances
there prevailing.
Article II. Austrian vessels arriving, either laden or in ballast, in the ports of the United States of America; and, reciprocally, vessels of the United States arriving, either laden, or in ballast, in the ports of the dominions of Austria, shall be treated on their entrance, during their stay and at their departure, upon the same footing as national vessels coming from the same place, with respect to the duties of tonnage, light-houses, pilotage and port charges, as well as to the fees and perquisites of public officers and all other duties or charges of whatever kind or denomination, levied in the name, or to the profit of the Government, the local authorities, or of any private establishment whatso-
ever.
Article III. All kind of merchandise and articles of commerce, either the produce of the soil or the industry of the United States of America, or of any other country, which may be lawfully imported into the ports of the dominions of Austria, in Austrian vessels, may also be so imported in vessels of the United States of America, without paying other or higher duties or charges, of whatever kind or denomination, levied in the name or to the profit of the Government, the local authorities or of any private establishments whatsoever, than if the same merchandise or produce had been imported in Austrian vessels. And, reciprocally, all kind of merchandise and articles of commerce, either the produce of the soil or of the industry of the dominions of Austria, or of any other country, which may be lawfully imported into the ports of the United States, in vessels of the said States, may also be so imported in Austrian vessels, without paying other or higher duties or charges, of whatever kind or denomination levied in the name, or to the profit of the Government, the local authorities, or of any private establishments whatsoever, than if the same merchandise or produce had been imported in vessels of the United States of America.
Artic le IV. To prevent the possibility of any misunderstanding, it is hereby declared that the stipulations contained in the two preceding articles, are, to their full extent, applicable to Austrian vessels and their cargoes, arriving in the ports of the United States of America; and, reciprocally, to vessels of the said States and their cargoes arriving in the ports of the dominions of Austria, whether the said vessels dear directly from the ports of the country to which they respectively belong, or from the ports of any other foreign country.
Arti cle V. No higher or other duties shall be imposed on the importation into the United States, of any article the produce or manufac-

ture of the dominions of Austria; and no higher or other duties shall be imposed on the importation into the dominions of Austria, of any article the produce or manufacture of the United States, than are, or shall be payable on the like article, being the produce or manufacture of any other foreign country. Nor shall any prohibition be imposed on the importation or exportation of any article the produce or manufacture of the United States, or of the dominions of Austria, to or from the ports of the United States, or to or from the ports of the dominions of Austria, which shall not equally extend to all other nations.

Duties, bounties, and drawbacks on exports.
Coastwise navigation.

Art icl e VI. All kind of merchandize and articles of commerce, either the produce of the soil or of the industry of the United States of America, or of any other country, which may be lawfully exported, or re-exported from the ports of the said United States, in national vessels, may also be exported, or re-exported therefrom in Austrian vessels, without paying other, or higher duties or charges of whatever kind or denomination, levied in the name or to the profit of the Government, the local authorities, or of any private establishments whatsoever, than if the same merchandise or produce had been exported or re-exported, in vessels of the United States of America.
An exact reciprocity shall be observed in the ports of the dominions of Austria, so that all kinds of merchandise and articles of commerce either the produce of the soil or of the industry of the said dominions of Austria, or of any other country, which may be lawfully exported or re-exported, from Austrian ports, in national vessels, may also be exported or re-exported therefrom, in vessels of the United States of America, without paying other or higher duties or charges, of whatever kind or denomination, levied in the name or to the profit of the Government, the local authorities, or of any private establishments whatsoever, than if the same merchandise or produce had been exported, or re-exported, in Austrian vessels.
And the same bounties and drawbacks shall be allowed, whether such exportation or re-exportation be made in vessels of the one party, or of the other.
Arti cle VII. It is expressly understood and agreed that the coastwise navigation of both the contracting parties, is altogether excepted from the operation of this treaty, and of every article thereof.

Vessels of the parties to be equally favored.

Arti cle VIII. No priority or preference shall be given, directly, or indirectly, by either of the contracting parties, nor by any Company, Corporation or Agent, acting on their behalf or under their authority, in the purchase of any article of commerce, lawfully imported, on account of, or in reference to the character of the vessel, whether it be of the one party or of the other, in which such article was imported, it being the true intent and meaning of the contracting parties that no distinction or difference whatever shall be made in this respect.

Future favors. Consuls, &c.

Arti cle IX. If either party shall hereafter grant to any other nation any particular favor in navigation or commerce, it shall immediately become common to the other party, freely, where it is freely granted to such other nation, or on yielding the same compensation, when the grant is conditional.
Art ic le X. The two contracting parties hereby reciprocally grant to each other, the liberty of having, each in the ports of the other, Consuls, Vice-Consuls, Agents and Commissaries of their own appointment, who shall enjoy the same privileges and powers as those of the most favoured nations. But if any such Consuls shall exercise commerce, they shall be subjected to the same laws and usages to which

TREATY WITH AUSTRIA. 1829.

401

the private individuals of their nation are subject in the same place, in respect of their commercial transactions.

Arti cle XL The citizens or subjects of each party shall have power to dispose of their personal goods, within the jurisdiction of the other, by testament, donation, or otherwise; and their representatives, being citizens or subjects of the other party, shall succeed to their personal goods, whether by testament, or ab intestato, and may take possession thereof, either by themselves or by others acting for them, and dispose of the same at their will, paying such dues, taxes or charges, only, as the inhabitants of the country wherein the said goods are shall be subject to pay in like cases. And in case of the absence of the representative, such care shall be taken of the said goods, as would be taken of
the goods of a native in like case, until the lawful owner may take measures for receiving them. And if any question should arise among several claimants, to which of them said goods belong, the same shall be decided finally by the laws and Judges of the land wherein the said goods are. But this article shall not derogate, in any manner, from the force of the laws already published, or hereafter to be published by His Majesty the Emperor of Austria, to prevent the emigration of his subjects.

Property of individuals.

Arti cle XII. The present treaty shall continue in force for ten years, counting from the day of the exchange of the ratifications; and if twelve months before the expiration of that period, neither of the high contracting parties shall have announced by an official notification to the other, its intention to arrest the operation of said treaty, it shall remain binding for one year beyond that time, and so on, until the expiration of the twelve months which will follow a similar notification whatever the time at which it may take place.
Arti cle XIII. This Treaty shall be approved and ratified by the President of the United States, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate thereof; and by His Majesty the Emperor of Austria; and the ratifications shall be exchanged in the City of Washington, within twelve months from the date of the signature hereof, or sooner, if possible.

Duration of the treaty. Ratifications.

In faith whereof the respective Plenipotentiaries have signed and sealed this treaty, both in the English and German languages, declaring, however, that, it having been originally composed in the former, the English version is to decide the interpretation, should any difference in regard to it unfortunately arise.

Done in triplicate, at Washington, this twenty-seventh day of August, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and twentynine.
