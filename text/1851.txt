ADVERTISEMENT.
In publishing the following Laws, the same plan has been adopted that was prescribed in the joint resolution of Congress of March 3, 1845, authorizing a subscription to the edition of all the Laws of the United States just published by us. As we procured a careful collation with the records at Washington, by an experienced reader, and have scrupulously followed the original, we feel justified in saying that the public can safely rely on this publication. Any seeming errors, therefore, must be attributed to the Rolls, and not to us. Where any thing absolutely necessary to the sense is omitted in the Rolls, our plan is to insert it in the text, enclosed in brackets.
LITTLE & BROWN. Bost on , October 1, 1851.

TREATY WITH COSTARICA. July 10, 1851.

July 10, 1851. BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

A PROCLAMATION.
Where as , a Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation between the United States of America and the Republic of Costarica was concluded and signed in the city of Washington, by their respective Plenipotentiaries, on the tenth day of July, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and fifty-one, the original of which Treaty, being in the English and Spanish languages, is, word for word, as follows :
TREATY
Of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation, between the United States of America and the Republic of Costarica.

Preamble. Negotiators.

In the name of the Most Holy Trinity.
Commercial intercourse having been for some time established between the United States and the Republic of Costarica, it seems good for the security as well as the encouragement of such commercial intercourse, and for the maintenance of good understanding between the United States and the said Republic, that the relations now subsisting between them should be regularly acknowledged and confirmed by the signature of a treaty of amity, commerce, and navigation.
For this purpose they have named their respective Plenipotentiaries, that is to say :
The President of the United States, Daniel Webster, Secretary of State;
And his Excellency the President of the Republic of Costarica, Senor Don Felipe Molina, Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of that Republic to the United States;
Who, after having communicated to each other their full powers, found to be in due and proper form, have agreed upon and concluded the following articles:

En el Nombre de la Santissima Trinidad.
Habiendo trafico comercial establecido hace algun tiempo, entre la Republica de Costarica y los Estados Unidos, ha parecido conveniente, para la seguridad, como tambien para el fomento de sus mutuos intereses, y para la conservacion de la buena inteligencia entre la mencionada Republica y los Estados Unidos, que las relaciones que ahora existen entre ambas partes, sean reconocidas y confirmadas formalmente, por medio de un Tratado de Amistad, Comercio, y Navegacion.
Con este objeto, han sido nombrados los respectivos Plenipotenciarios, a saber:
Por su Excelencia el Presidente de la Republica de Costarica, el Senor Don Felipe Molina, Enviado Extraordinario y Ministro Plenipotenciario de dicha Republica cerca del Gobierno de los Estados Unidos ;
Y por el Presidente de los Estados Unidos, Daniel Webster, Secretario de Estado;

restrained from leaving it with her cargo, nor, if found therein before or after the reduction and surrender,
shall such vessel or her cargo be liable to seizure, confiscation, or
any demand on the score of redemption or restitution ; but the owners
thereof shall remain in the undisturbed possession of their property. And if any vessel having thus entered the port before the blockade took place shall take on board a cargo after the blockade be esta-
blished, and attempt to depart, she may be warned by the blockading forces to return to the blockaded port, and discharge the said cargo; and if, after receiving such warn-

been warned off by the blockading forces.

Now, therefore, I, JOHN TYLER, President of the United States, do issue this my proclamation, admonishing all such evil-minded persons of the condign punishment which is certain to overtake them; assuring them that the laws of the United States will be rigorously executed against their illegal acts; and that if in any lawless incursion into Canada they fall into the hands of the British authorities, they will not be reclaimed as American citizens, nor any interference made by this government in their behalf. And I exhort all well-meaning but deluded persons who may have joined these lodges, immediately to abandon them, and to have nothing more to do with their secret meetings, or unlawful oaths, as they would avoid serious consequences to themselves. And I expect the intelligent and well-disposed members of the community to frown on all these unlawful combinations, and illegal proceedings, and to assist the government in maintaining the peace of the country, against the mischievous consequences of the acts of these violators of the law.

An exequatur having been granted to Seor Carlos de Espaa, bearing date the 29th October, 1846, recognizing him as the consul of Her Catholic Majesty at the port of New Orleans, and declaring him free to exercise and enjoy such functions, powers, and privileges as are allowed to the consuls of the most favored nations in the United States: These are now to declare, that I do no longer recognize the said Carlos de Espaa, as consul of Her Catholic Majesty in any part of the United States; nor permit him to exercise and enjoy any of the functions, powers, or privileges, allowed to the consuls of Spain; and I do hereby wholly revoke and annul the said exequatur heretofore given; and do declare the same to be absolutely null and void from this day forward.
In testimony whereof, I have caused these letters to be made patent, and [L. S.] the seal of the United States of America to be hereunto affixed.

colony of Spain, with which this country is at peace ; and whereas it is believed that this expedition is instigated and set on foot chiefly by foreigners who dare to make our shores the scene of their guilty and hostile preparations against a friendly power; and seek by falsehood and misrepresentation to seduce our own citizens, especially the young and inconsiderate, into their wicked schemes,-- an ungrateful return for the benefits conferred upon them by this people, in permitting them to make our country an asylum from oppression,--and in flagrant abuse of the hospitality thus extended to them:
And whereas such expeditions can only be regarded as adventures for plunder and robbery, and must meet the condemnation of the civilized world, whilst they are derogatory to the character of our country,--in violation of the laws of nations,--and expressly prohibited by our own. Our statutes declare " that if any person shall, within the territory or jurisdiction of the United States, begin or set on foot, or provide or prepare the means for, any military expedition or enterprise, to be carried on from thence against the territory or dominions of any foreign prince or state, or of any colony, district, or people, with whom the United States are at peace, every person, so offending, shall be deemed guilty of a high.misdemeanor, and shall be fined not exceeding three thousand dollars, and imprisoned not more than three years: "
Now, therefore, I have issued this my Proclamation, warning all persons who shall connect themselves with any such enterprise or expedition in violation of our laws and national obligations that they will thereby subject themselves to the heavy penalties denounced against such offences, and will forfeit their claim to the protection of this government, or any interference in their behalf, no matter to what extremities they may be reduced in consequence of their illegal conduct. And therefore I exhort all good citizens, as they regard our national reputation, as they respect their own laws and the laws of nations, as they value the blessings of peace and the welfare of their country, to discountenance, and, by all lawful means, prevent any such enterprise ; and I call upon every officer of this government, civil or military, to use all efforts in his power, to arrest for trial and punishment every such offender against the laws of the country.

Preamble respecting a for-

The attention of the Pre sid en t having been called to the proceedings of Congress at the close of its session, on the 4th of March, 1851, from which it appears that the constitutional term of that body was held not to have expired until 12 o'clock at noon of that day; and a notice having been issued, agreeably to former usage., to convene the Senate at eleven o'clock, A. M., on the 4th of March next, it is apparent that such call is in conflict with the decision aforesaid :
Now, therefore, as well for the purpose of removing all doubtAs to the legality of such call, as of establishing a precedent of what is deemed a proper mode of convening the Senate, I, MILLARD FILLMORE, President of the United States, have considered it to be my duty to issue this my Proclamation, revoking said call, and hereby declaring that an extraordinary occasion requires the Senate of the United States to convene for the transaction of business at. the capitol, m the city of Washington, on Friday, the 4th day of March next, at twelve o'clock, at noon of that day, of which all who shall at that time be entitled to act as members of that body are hereby required to take notice.
