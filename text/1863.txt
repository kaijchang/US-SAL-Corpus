ADVERTISEMENT.

In publishing the following Laws, the same plan has been adopted that was pie scribed in the Joint Resolution of Congress of March 3, 1845, authorizing a subscription to the edition of all the Laws of the United States published by us. A close examination of this volume will disclose some apparent errors in the Laws as here printed; but as we procure a careful collation with the records at Washington by an experienced reader of the Department of State, and scrupulously follow the original, any seeming errors must be attributed to the Rolls, and not to us. Where anything absolutely necessary to the sense is omitted in the Rolls, it is inserted in the text, enclosed in brackets.

We intend to publish annually, and as soon after the close of each Session of Congress as is possible, the Acts of that Session, in a similar form and with a similar arrangement.

It will be seen, by the following extract from the Act of Congress, August 8th, 1846, and Joint Resolution of September 26, 1850, that our edition has been sanctioned by Congress, and is the Offic ial Edi ti on .

" And whereas said edition of the said Law s and Tre at ie s of th e Unit ed Stat es has been carefully collated and compared with the original Rolls in the Archives oj the Government, under the inspection and supervision of the AttorneyGeneral of the United States, as duly certified by that officer: therefore, Be it further enacted, that said edition of the Law s an d Tre at ies of th e Uni te d Sta te s , published by Litt le & Bro wn , is hereby declared to be competent evidence of the several Public and Private Acts of Congress, and of the several Treaties therein contained, in all the Courts of Law and Equity and Maritime Jurisdiction, and in all the Tribunals and Public Offices of the United States and of the several States,
without any further proof or authentication thereof. Approv ed , August 8, 1846."

" Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the Secretary of State be authorized and directed to contract with Lit tl e & Bro wn to furnish their annual Statutes at Large, printed in conformity with the plan adopted by Congress in eighteen hundred and forty-five, instead of the edition usually issued by his order, under the act of Congress of April twentieth, eighteen hundred and eighteen, and which conforms to an edition of the laws now out of use. -- Approv ed , September 26, 1850."

Sec . 5. And be it further enacted, That it shall be the duty of the superintendent and supervisors of roads to have at least three fourths of the work to be done on them during the year performed as early as the middle of July; and in making and repairing the roads they shall be raised full twelve inches higher in the middle than at the sides, and shall be gradually rounded off to the gutters, which shall be made capacious enough to carry off all the falling water.
Sec . 6. And be it further enacted, That no bill for labor performed upon any road or bridge shall be allowed or paid to any supervisor by the levy court which is not accompanied by a certificate of the superintendent of roads that he has personally examined the road or bridge so made or repaired, and that the work has been well done and according to law, and that the charges are reasonable and just: Provided, however, That one or more members of the court, to be appointed for that purpose, may, after personal examination, make such certificate.
Sec . 7. And be it further enacted, That on extraordinary occasions, when any public road or bridge shall be destroyed, or so injured as to require immediate repair, it shall be the duty of the superintendent as well as the supervisor of the road to cause the necessary repairs to be forthwith made ; and if there are no funds in hand with which to hire laborers and teams, or if laborers and teams cannot be otherwise procured, the said supervisor shall immediately summon a sufficient number of men living nearest the place to appear and labor on said road or bridge until it shall be repaired; and he may also require any person owning a team and living within a reasonable distance to appear with said team and cart or wagon and plough.

For labor, the use of teams, and other necessary implements, performed and furnished on such occasions, a just and fair compensation shall be paid, to be fixed by the said court.

They shall then cause notice to be given, by advertisement, twice a week for three weeks, of the proposed opening of the new road, or of the alteration of an existing one, calling upon all persons who may have any objections thereto to present them to the court at its next regular meeting. If any objections are made, the court shall then and there hear them. If the route only is objected to, and another or others suggested as more advantageous, the court may adopt it, or appoint five discreet, disinterested men, of whom the county surveyor shall be one, to examine all the proposed routes, and report such an one as they shall deem most feasible and advantageous to the county, and such report shall be made to the court at its next session. If no objection to the opening or altering a road by the owners of the land through which it must pass after such notice [is made], it shall be taken for granted that no damages are or will be claimed, and the road may be recorded and opened, and shall then be

owners upon the amount, then the court shall direct the marshal of the District to summon a jury of seven judicious, disinterested men, not related to any party interested, to be and appear on the premises on a day specified to assess the damages, if any, which each owner of land through which the road is to pass may sustain by reason thereof. And the marshal shall summon such jury, and administer an oath or affirmation to them that they will, without favor or partiality to any one, to the best of their judgment, decide what damage, if any, each owner may sustain by reason of running the road through his premises ; but in doing this they shall take into consideration the benefit it may be to him or her by enhancing the value of his or her land, or otherwise, and give their verdict accordingly. It shall be the duty of the marshal, upon receiving the order from the court, to give the owner or owners aforesaid not less than ten days' notice of the time and place of the meeting of the jury to assess their damages. In cases where notice cannot be served on the owner or owners, the same proceedings shall be had as is provided in this section in the case of minors. The jury, having been upon the premises and assessed the damages, shall make out a written verdict, to be signed by them, or a majority of them, and attested by the marshal, which the marshal shall transmit to the court at its next session, and which shall be recorded. If the court or any owner or owners of the land aforesaid are dissatisfied writh the verdict thus rendered, and no arrangement being made between the court and the said owner or owners, the court shall order the marshal to summon a second jury of twelve judicious, disinterested men, not related to any one interested, to meet and view the premises, giving the parties interested at least ten days' notice of the time and place of meeting. And the marshal and jury shall proceed as before directed in regard to the first jui-y. And the verdict, signed by each of the jurors, or a majority of them, shall be returned to the court at its next session, and recorded as final and conclusive, and the road shall then be declared a public road, and the court shall order it to be opened as such. And the same mode of proceeding shall be observed in cases where application shall be made to the court by the residents of the county to lay out a new, or alter any existing road. In all cases where the land through wfliich it is proposed to run a road shall belong to a minor or minors, it shall be presumed that objection is made, and the damages assessed accordingly. In all cases where it becomes necessary to summon a second jury to assess damages, if the amount assessed by the second jury shall not be greater than the amount assessed by the first, the costs of the second jury shall be paid by the party or parties objecting to the first verdict; but if greater, they shall be paid by the county. All expenses up to the second jury shall be paid by the county.

No. 19.

March 30,1863. BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:

A PROCLAMATION.

Preamble. Day set apart as a day of National humiliation, fasting, and prayer.

Whe re as , the Senate of the United States, devoutly recognizing the Su-
preme Authority and just Government of Almighty God, in all the affairs of men and of nations, has, by a resolution, requested the President to designate and set apart a day for National prayer and humiliation :
And whereas it is the duty of nations as well as of men, to own their dependence upon the overruling power of God, to confess their sins and transgressions, in humble sorrow, yet with assured hope that genuine repentance will lead to mercy and pardon ; and to recognize the sublime truth, announced in the Holy Scriptures and proven by all history, that those nations only are blessed whose God is the Lord :
And, insomuch as we know that, by His divine law, nations, like individuals, are subjected to punishments and chastisements in this world, may we not justly fear that the awful calamity of civil war, which now desolates the land, may be but a punishment inflicted upon us for our presumptuous sins, to the needful end of our national reformation as a whole People ? We have been the recipients of the choicest bounties of Heaven. We have been preserved, these many years, in peace and prosperity. We have grown in numbers, wealth, and power as no other nation has ever grown. But we have forgotten God. We have forgotten the gracious hand which preserved us in peace, and multiplied and enriched and strengthened us ; and we have vainly imagined, in the deceitfulness of our hearts, that all these blessings were produced by some superior wisdom and virtue of our own. Intoxicated with unbroken success, we have become too self-sufficient to feel the necessity of redeeming and preserving grace, too proud to pray to the God that made us !
It behooves us, then, to humble ourselves before the offended Power, to confess our national sins, and to pray for clemency and forgiveness.
Now, therefore, in compliance with the request, and fully concurring in the views of the Senate, I do, by this my proclamation, designate and set apart Thursday, the 30th day of April, 1863, as a day of national humiliation, fasting, and prayer. And I do hereby request all the People to abstain on that day from their ordinary secular pursuits, and to unite, at their several places of public worship and their respective homes, in keeping the day holy to the Lord, and devoted to the humble discharge of the religious duties proper to that solemn occasion.
All this being done, in sincerity and truth, let us then rest humbly in the hope authorized by the Divine teachings, that the united cry of the Nation will be heard on high, and answered with blessings, no less than the pardon of our national sins, and the restoration of our now divided and suffering country, to its former happy condition of unity and peace.
In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
Done at the city of Washington this thirtieth day of March, in the [L. 8.] year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, and of
the Independence of the United States the eighty-seventh. ABRAHAM LINCOLN.

Compensation to loyal persons for certain losses.

Sec . 10. And be it further enacted, That no slave escaping into any state, territory, or the District of Columbia, from any other state, shall be delivered up, or in any way impeded or hindered of his liberty, except for crime, or some offence against the laws, unless the person claiming said fugitive shall first make oath that the person to whom the labor or service of such fugitive is alleged to be due is his lawful owner, and has not borne arms against the United States in the present rebellion, nor in any way given aid and comfort thereto; and no person engagedin the military or naval service of the United States shall, under any pretence whatever, assume to decide on the validity of the claim of any person to the service or labor of any other person, or surrender up any such person to the claimant, on pain of being dismissed from the service."
And I do hereby enjoin upon and order all persons engaged in the military and naval service of the United States to observe, obey, and enforce, within their respective spheres of service, the act and sections above recited.
And the Executive will in due time recommend that all citizens of the United
States who shall have remained loyal thereto throughout the rebellion shall (upon the restoration of the constitutional relation between the United States and their respective states and people, if that relation shall have been suspended or disturbed) be compensated for all losses by acts of the United States, including the loss of slaves.
In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.

Certain states and parts of states designated as in rebellion.
A'Ve, p. 1267.

Wher eas , on the twenty-second day of September, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-two, a proclamation was issued by the President of the United States, containing, among other things, the following, to wit:
" That on the first day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, all persons held as slaves within any state or designated part of a state, the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the United States, shall be then, thenceforward, and forever, free; and the Executive Government of the United States, including the military and naval authority thereof, will recognize and maintain the freedom of such persons, and will do no act or acts to repress such persons, or any of them, in any efforts they may make for their actual ffeedom.
" That the Executive will, on the first day of January aforesaid, by proclamation, designate the states and parts of states, if any, in which the people thereof, respectively, shall then be in rebellion against the United States; and the fact
that any state, or the people thereof, shall on that day be in good faith represented in the Congress of the United States, by members chosen thereto at, elections wherein a majority of the qualified voters of such states shall have participated, shall, in the absence of strong countervailing testimony, be deemed conclusive evidence that such state, and the people thereof, are not then in rebellion against the United States."
Now, therefore, I. Abr ah am Lin co ln , President of the United States, by virtue of the power in me vested as commander-in-chief of the army and navy of the United States, in time of actual armed rebellion against the authority and Government of the United States, and as a fit and necessary war measure for suppressing said rebellion, do, on this first day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, and in accordance with my purpose so to do, publicly proclaimed for the full period of one hundred day?

A PROCLAMATION.

Preamble. 1863, ch. 75. Vol. xii. p. 731.
Plea of alienage not to be allowed to exempt, &c.

Whe re as , The congress of the United States at its last session enacted a law entitled " An act for enrolling and calling out the national forces, and for other purposes," which was approved on the 3d day of March last; and
Whereas, It is recited in the said act that there now exists in the United States an insurrection and rebellion against the authority thereof, and it is, under the Constitution of the United States, the duty of the government to suppress insurrection and rebellion, to guarantee to each state a republican form of government, and to preserve the public tranquillity; and
Whereas, For these high purposes a military force is indispensable, to raise and support which all persons ought willingly to contribute ; and
Whereas, No service can be more praiseworthy and honorable than that which is rendered for the maintenance of the Constitution and Union, and the consequent preservation of free government; and
Whereas, For the reasons thus recited, it was enacted by the said statute that all able-bodied male citizens of the United States and persons of foreign birth
who shall have declared on oath their intention to become citizens under and in pursuance of the laws thereof, between the ages of twenty and forty-five years, (with certain exceptions not necessary to be here mentioned,) are declared to constitute the national forces, and shall be liable to perform military duty in the service of the United States, when called out by the President for
that purpose; and Whereas, It is claimed by and in behalf of persons of foreign birth within the
ages specified in said act who have heretofore declared on oath their intentions to become citizens under and in pursuance of the laws of the United States, and
who have not exercised the right of suffrage or any other political franchise under the laws of the United States, or of any of the states thereof, that they are not absolutely concluded by their aforesaid declaration of intention from re-
nouncing their purpose to become citizens, and that, on the contrary, such persons under treaties or the law of nations retain a right to renounce that purpose and to forego the privileges of citizenship and residence within the United States
under the obligations imposed by the aforesaid act of congress : Now, therefore, to avoid all misapprehensions concerning the liability of per-
sons concerned to perform the service required by such enactment, and to give it full effect, I do hereby order and proclaim that no plea of alienage will be received or allowed to exempt from the obligations imposed by the aforesaid act
of congress, any person of foreign birth who shall have declared on oath his intention to become a citizen of the United States under the laws thereof, and who shall be found within the United States at any time during the continuance of the present insurrection and rebellion, at or after the expiration of the period of sixty-five days from the date of'this Proclamation, nor shall any such plea of
alienage be allowed in favor of any such person who has so, as aforesaid, declared his intention to become a citizen of the United States, and shall have exercised at any time the right of suffrage, or any other political franchise, within the United States, under the laws thereof, or under the laws of any of the several states.
In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.

It has pleased Almighty God to hearken to the supplications and prayers of an afflicted people, and to vouchsafe to the Army and the Navy of the United States victories on land and on the sea so signal and so effective as to furnish reasonable grounds for augmented confidence that the Union of these states will be maintained, their Constitution preserved, and their peace and prosperity permanently restored. But these victories have been accorded not without sacrifices of life, limb, health, and liberty, incurred by brave, loyal, and patriotic citizens. Domestic affliction in every part of the country follows in the train of these fearful bereavements. It is meet and right to recognize and confess the presence of the Almighty Father and the power of His hand equally in these triumphs and in these sorrows.

Preamble. 1863, ch. 75. Vol. xii. p. 731.
Plea of alienage not to be allowed to exempt, &c.

Whe re as , The congress of the United States at its last session enacted a law entitled " An act for enrolling and calling out the national forces, and for other purposes," which was approved on the 3d day of March last; and
Whereas, It is recited in the said act that there now exists in the United States an insurrection and rebellion against the authority thereof, and it is, under the Constitution of the United States, the duty of the government to suppress insurrection and rebellion, to guarantee to each state a republican form of government, and to preserve the public tranquillity; and
Whereas, For these high purposes a military force is indispensable, to raise and support which all persons ought willingly to contribute ; and
Whereas, No service can be more praiseworthy and honorable than that which is rendered for the maintenance of the Constitution and Union, and the consequent preservation of free government; and
Whereas, For the reasons thus recited, it was enacted by the said statute that all able-bodied male citizens of the United States and persons of foreign birth
who shall have declared on oath their intention to become citizens under and in pursuance of the laws thereof, between the ages of twenty and forty-five years, (with certain exceptions not necessary to be here mentioned,) are declared to constitute the national forces, and shall be liable to perform military duty in the service of the United States, when called out by the President for
that purpose; and Whereas, It is claimed by and in behalf of persons of foreign birth within the
ages specified in said act who have heretofore declared on oath their intentions to become citizens under and in pursuance of the laws of the United States, and
who have not exercised the right of suffrage or any other political franchise under the laws of the United States, or of any of the states thereof, that they are not absolutely concluded by their aforesaid declaration of intention from re-
nouncing their purpose to become citizens, and that, on the contrary, such persons under treaties or the law of nations retain a right to renounce that purpose and to forego the privileges of citizenship and residence within the United States
under the obligations imposed by the aforesaid act of congress : Now, therefore, to avoid all misapprehensions concerning the liability of per-
sons concerned to perform the service required by such enactment, and to give it full effect, I do hereby order and proclaim that no plea of alienage will be received or allowed to exempt from the obligations imposed by the aforesaid act
of congress, any person of foreign birth who shall have declared on oath his intention to become a citizen of the United States under the laws thereof, and who shall be found within the United States at any time during the continuance of the present insurrection and rebellion, at or after the expiration of the period of sixty-five days from the date of'this Proclamation, nor shall any such plea of
alienage be allowed in favor of any such person who has so, as aforesaid, declared his intention to become a citizen of the United States, and shall have exercised at any time the right of suffrage, or any other political franchise, within the United States, under the laws thereof, or under the laws of any of the several states.
In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.

except in the theatre of military conflict; while that theatre has been greatly contracted by the advancing armies and navies of the Union.

Needful diversions of wealth and of strength from the fields of peaceful indus-

try to the national defence have not arrested the plough, the shuttle, or the

ship ; the axe has enlarged the borders of our settlements, and the mines, as

well of iron and coal as of the precious metals, have yielded even more abun-

dantly than heretofore. Population has steadily increased, notwithstanding the

waste that has.been made in the camp, the siege, and the battle-field, and the

country, rejoicing in the consciousness of augmented strength and vigor, is per-

mitted to expect continuance of years with large increase of freedom.

No human counsel hath devised, nor hath any mortal hand worked out these

great things. They are the gracious gifts of the Most High God, who, while

dealing with us in anger for our sins, hath nevertheless remembered mercy.

It has seemed to me fit and proper that they should be solemnly, rever-

ently, and gratefully acknowledged as with one heart and one voice by the

whole American people. I do, therefore, invite my fellow-citizens in every

part of the United States, and also those who are at sea and those who are

sojourning in foreign lands, to set apart and observe the last Thursday of

November next as a Day of Thanksgiving and Praise to our beneficent Father

who dwelleth in the heavens. And I recommend to them that, while offering up the ascriptions justly due to Him for such singular deliverances and blessing

they do also, with humble penitence for our national perverseness and disobe-

dience, commend to His tender care all those who have become widows, or-

phans, mourners, or sufferers, in the lamentable civil strife in which we are

unavoidably engaged, and fervently implore the interposition of the Almighty

hand to heal the wounds of the nation, and to restore it, as soon as may be con-

sistent with the Divine purposes, to the full enjoyment of peace, harmony, tranquillity, and union.

Whe re as , the term of service of a part of the volunteer forces of the United States will expire during the coming year; and whereas, in addition to the men raised by the present draft, it is deemed expedient to call out three hundred thousand volunteers to serve for three years or the war, not however exceeding three years:
Now, therefore, I, Abr 4ha m Lin co ln , President of the United States and Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy thereof, and of the militia of the several states when called into actual service, do issue this my proclamation, calling upon the governors of the different states to raise and have enlisted into the United States service, for the various companies and regiments in the field from their respective states, their quotas of three hundred thousand men.
I further proclaim that all volunteers thus called out and duly enlisted shall
receive advance pay, premium, and bounty, as heretofore communicated to the governors of states by the War Department, through the provost-marshal »en eral's office, by special letters.
I further proclaim that all volunteers received under this call, as well as all others not heretofore credited, shall be duly credited on, and deducted from, the quotas established for the next draft.

Wher ea s , by an act of the congress of the United States of the 24th of May, one thousand eight hundred and twenty-eight, entitled " An act in addition to an act entitled ` An act concerning discriminating duties of tonnage and impost,' and to equalize the duties on Prussian vessels and their cargoes," it is provided that, upon satisfactory evidence being given to the President of the United States, by the government of any foreign nation, that no discriminating duties of tonnage or impost are imposed or levied in the ports of the said nation upon vessels wholly belonging to citizens of the United States, or upon the produce, manufactures, or merchandise imported in the same from the United States, or from any foreign country, the President is thereby authorized to issue his proclamation declaring that the foreign discriminating duties of tonnage and impost within the United States are and shall be suspended and discontinued, so far as respects the vessels of the said foreign nation, and the produce, manufactures,
or merchandise imported into the United States in the same from the said foreign nation, or from any other foreign country; the said suspension to take effect from the time of such notification being given to the President of the United
States, and to continue so long as the reciprocal exemption of vessels belonging to citizens of the United States, and their cargoes, as aforesaid, shall be continued, and no longer;
And whereas, satisfactory evidence has lately been received by me, through an official communication of Senor Don Luis Molina, Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of the Republic of Nicaragua, under date of the 28th of November, 1863, that no other or higher duties of tonnage and impost have been imposed or' levied since the second day of August, 1838, in the ports of Nicaragua, upon vessels wholly belonging to citizens of the United States, and upon the produce, manufactures, or merchandise imported in the same from the United States, and from any foreign country whatever, than are levied on Nicaraguan ships and their cargoes in the same ports under like circumstances :
Now, therefore, I, Abr aha m Linc oln , President of the United States of America, do hereby declare and proclaim, that so much of the several acts imposing discriminating duties of tonnage and impost within the United States are, and shall be, suspended and discontinued, so far as respects the vessels of Nicaragua, and the produce, manufactures, and merchandise imported into the United States in the same from the dominions of Nicaragua, and from any other foreign country whatever; the said suspension to take effect from the day above mentioned, and to continue thenceforward, so long as the reciprocal exemption of the vessels of the United States, and the produce, manufactures, and merchandise imported into the dominions of Nicaragua in the same, as aforesaid, shall be continued on the part of the government of Nicaragua.

except in the theatre of military conflict; while that theatre has been greatly contracted by the advancing armies and navies of the Union.

Needful diversions of wealth and of strength from the fields of peaceful indus-

try to the national defence have not arrested the plough, the shuttle, or the

ship ; the axe has enlarged the borders of our settlements, and the mines, as

well of iron and coal as of the precious metals, have yielded even more abun-

dantly than heretofore. Population has steadily increased, notwithstanding the

waste that has.been made in the camp, the siege, and the battle-field, and the

country, rejoicing in the consciousness of augmented strength and vigor, is per-

mitted to expect continuance of years with large increase of freedom.

No human counsel hath devised, nor hath any mortal hand worked out these

great things. They are the gracious gifts of the Most High God, who, while

dealing with us in anger for our sins, hath nevertheless remembered mercy.

It has seemed to me fit and proper that they should be solemnly, rever-

ently, and gratefully acknowledged as with one heart and one voice by the

whole American people. I do, therefore, invite my fellow-citizens in every

part of the United States, and also those who are at sea and those who are

sojourning in foreign lands, to set apart and observe the last Thursday of

November next as a Day of Thanksgiving and Praise to our beneficent Father

who dwelleth in the heavens. And I recommend to them that, while offering up the ascriptions justly due to Him for such singular deliverances and blessing

they do also, with humble penitence for our national perverseness and disobe-

dience, commend to His tender care all those who have become widows, or-

phans, mourners, or sufferers, in the lamentable civil strife in which we are

unavoidably engaged, and fervently implore the interposition of the Almighty

hand to heal the wounds of the nation, and to restore it, as soon as may be con-

sistent with the Divine purposes, to the full enjoyment of peace, harmony, tranquillity, and union.

In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.

[L. S.] of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, and of the

Independence of the United States the eighty-eighth.

A PROCLAMATION.

Preamble.
Three hundred thousand men called for.
Volunteers to receive advance pay, bounty, &c.
to be credited to state.

Whe re as , the term of service of a part of the volunteer forces of the United States will expire during the coming year; and whereas, in addition to the men raised by the present draft, it is deemed expedient to call out three hundred thousand volunteers to serve for three years or the war, not however exceeding three years:
Now, therefore, I, Abr 4ha m Lin co ln , President of the United States and Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy thereof, and of the militia of the several states when called into actual service, do issue this my proclamation, calling upon the governors of the different states to raise and have enlisted into the United States service, for the various companies and regiments in the field from their respective states, their quotas of three hundred thousand men.
I further proclaim that all volunteers thus called out and duly enlisted shall
receive advance pay, premium, and bounty, as heretofore communicated to the governors of states by the War Department, through the provost-marshal »en eral's office, by special letters.
I further proclaim that all volunteers received under this call, as well as all others not heretofore credited, shall be duly credited on, and deducted from, the quotas established for the next draft.

APPENDIX.

I further proclaim that if any state shall fail to raise the quota assigned to it by the War Department under this call, then a draft for the deficiency in said quota shall be made on said state, or on the districts of said state, for their due proportion of said quota; and the said draft shall commence on the fifth day of
January, 1864. And I further proclaim that nothing in this proclamation shall interfere with
existing orders, or those which may be issued, for the present draft in the states
where it is now in progress, or where it has not yet commenced. The quotas of the states and districts will be assigned by the War Depart-
ment, through the provost-marshal general's office, due regard being had for the men heretofore furnished, whether by volunteering or drafting, and the re-
cruiting will be conducted in accordance with such instructions as have been or
may be issued by that department. In issuing this proclamation, I address myself not only to the governors of
the several states, but also to the good and loyal people thereof, invoking them
to lend their willing, cheerful, and effective aid to the measures thus adopted, with a view to reinforce our victorious armies now in the field, and bring our needful military operations to a prosperous end, thus closing forever the foun-
tains of sedition and civil war. In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of the
United States to be affixed. Done at the city of Washington this seventeenth day of October, in the

take and subscribe an oath, and thenceforward keep and maintain said oath invi-

Form of oath.

" I,------------------ , do solemnly swear, in presence of Almighty God, that I will henceforth faithfully support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States and the Union of the States thereunder; and that I will, in like manner, abide by and faithfully support all acts of congress passed during the existing rebellion with reference to slaves, so long and so far as not repealed,
modified, or held void by congress, or by decision of the supreme court; and that I will, in like manner, abide by and faithfully support all proclamations of the President made during the existing rebellion having reference to slaves, so long and so far as not modified or declared void by decision of the supreme court. So help me God."

Persons excepted from amnesty.
Reestablishment of state government in certain states.
Provision as to freed men.
Name, &c., of state to be retained.
Proclamation does not refer to certain loyal states, &c.

The persons excepted from the benefits of the foregoing provisions are all who are, or shall have been, civil or diplomatic officers or agents of the so-called Confederate government; all who have left judicial stations under the United States to aid the rebellion ; all who are, or shall have been, military or naval officers of said so-called Confederate government above the rank of colonel in the army or of lieutenant in the navy ; all who left seats in the United States con-
gress to aid the rebellion; all who resigned commissions in the army or navy of the United States and afterwards aided the rebellion; and all who have engaged in any way in treating colored persons, or white persons in charge of such, otherwise than lawfully as prisoners of war, and which persons may have been found in the United States service as soldiers, seamen, or in any other capacity.
And I do further proclaim, declare, and make known that whenever, in any of the States of Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, and North Carolina, a number of persons, not
less than one.tenth in number of the votes cast in such state at the presidential election of the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty, each having taken the oath aforesaid, and not having since violated it, and being a
qualified voter by the election law of the state existing immediately before the so-called act of secession, and excluding all others, shall reestablish a state government which shall be republican, and in nowise contravening said oath, such
shall be recognized as the true government of the state, and the state shall receive thereunder the benefits of the constitutional provision which declares that "the United States shall guaranty to every state in this Union a republican form of government, and shall protect each of them against invasion; and on application of the legislature, or the executive, (when the legislature cannot be
convened,) against domestic violence." And I do further proclaim, declare, and make known that any provision which
may be adopted by such state government in relation to the freed people of
such state, which shall recognize and declare their permanent freedom, provide for their education, and which may yet be consistent as a temporary arrangement with their present condition as a laboring, landless, and homeless class, will
not be objected to by the National Executive. And it is suggested as not improper that, in constructing a loyal state govern-
ment in any state, the name of the state, the boundary, the subdivisions, the constitution, and . the general code of laws, as before the rebellion, be maintained, subject only to the modifications made necessary by the conditions hereinbefore stated, and such others, if any, not contravening said conditions, and which may be deemed expedient by those framing the new state government.
To avoid misunderstanding, it may be proper to say that this proclamation, so far as it relates to state governments, has no reference to states wherein loyal state governments have all the while been maintained. And, for the same reason, it may be proper to further say, that whether members sent to congress from any state shall be admitted to seats constitutionally rests exclusively with the respective houses, and not to any extent with the Executive. And still further, that this proclamation is intended to present the people of the states wherein the national authority has been suspended, and loyal state governments
have been subverted, a mode in and by which the national authority and loyal state governments may be reestablished within said states, or in any of them; and, while the mode presented is the best the Executive can suggest, with his present impressions, it must not be understood that no other possible mode would be
acceptable. Given under my hand at the city of Washington the eighth day of De-

States, and to continue so long as the reciprocal exemption of vessels belonging to citizens of the United States, and their cargoes, as aforesaid, shall be continued, and no longer;
And whereas, satisfactory evidence has lately been received by me, through an official communication of Senor Don Luis Molina, Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of the Republic of Nicaragua, under date of the 28th of November, 1863, that no other or higher duties of tonnage and impost have been imposed or' levied since the second day of August, 1838, in the ports of Nicaragua, upon vessels wholly belonging to citizens of the United States, and upon the produce, manufactures, or merchandise imported in the same from the United States, and from any foreign country whatever, than are levied on Nicaraguan ships and their cargoes in the same ports under like circumstances :
Now, therefore, I, Abr aha m Linc oln , President of the United States of America, do hereby declare and proclaim, that so much of the several acts imposing discriminating duties of tonnage and impost within the United States are, and shall be, suspended and discontinued, so far as respects the vessels of Nicaragua, and the produce, manufactures, and merchandise imported into the United States in the same from the dominions of Nicaragua, and from any other foreign country whatever; the said suspension to take effect from the day above mentioned, and to continue thenceforward, so long as the reciprocal exemption of the vessels of the United States, and the produce, manufactures, and merchandise imported into the dominions of Nicaragua in the same, as aforesaid, shall be continued on the part of the government of Nicaragua.

reservation, and the same rights secured to citizens of the U. S. as to right of way upon the streams and over the roads which may run through said reservation, as are therein set forth.
But it is further provided, that the United States is the only competent authority to declare and establish such necessary roads and highways, and that no other right is intended to be hereby granted to citizens of the United States than the right of way upon or over such roads as may thus be legally established: Provided, however, That the roads now usually travelled shall, in the mean time, be taken and deemed as within the meaning of this article, until otherwise enacted by act of Congress, or by the authority of the Indian department.
