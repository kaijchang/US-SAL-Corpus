And to this end, the officer aforesaid is hereby authorized and required to employ so
many persons as he may deem necessary to overcome such force, and to retain them in his service so long as circumstances may require.

Whereupon the court shall cause a record to be made of the matters so proved, and also a general description of the person so escaping, with such convenient certainty as may be ; and a transcript of such record, authenticated by the attestation of the clerk and of the seal of the said court, being produced in any other State, Territory, or district in which the person so escaping may be found, and being exhibited to any judge, commissioner, or other officer authorized by the law of the United States to cause persons escaping from service or labor to be delivered up, shall be held and taken to be full and conclusive evidence of the fact of escape, and that the service or labor of the person escaping is due to the party in such record mentioned. And upon the production by the said party of other and further evidence if necessary, either oral or by affidavit, in addition to what is contained in the said record of the identity of the person escaping, he or she shall be delivered up to the claimant. And the said court, commissioner, judge, or other person authorized by this act to grant certificates to claimants of fugitives, shall, upon the production of the record and other evidences aforesaid, grant to such claimant a certificate of his right to take any such person identified and proved to be owing service or labor as aforesaid, which certificate shall authorize such claimant to seize or arrest and transport such person to the State or Territory from which he escaped: Provided, That nothing herein contained shall be construed as requiring the production of a transcript of such record as evidence as aforesaid. But in its absence the claim shall be heard and determined upon other satisfactory proofs, competent in law.

some of the Provinces of Mexico. The best information which the executive has been able to obtain, points to the Island of Cuba as the object of this expedition. It is the duty of this government to observe the faith of treaties, and to prevent any aggression by our citizens upon the territories of friendly nations. I have therefore thought it necessary and proper to issue this proclamation, to warn all citizens of the United States who shall connect themselves with an enterprise so grossly in violation of our laws and our treaty obligations, that they will thereby subject themselves to the heavy penalties denounced against them by our acts of Congress, and will forfeit their claim to the protection of their country. No such persons must expect the interference of this government, in any form, on their behalf, no matter to what extremities they may be reduced in consequence of their conduct. An enterprise to invade the territories of a friendly nation, set on foot and prosecuted within the limits of the United States, is in the highest degree criminal, as tending to endanger the peace, and compromit the honor, of this nation : -- and, therefore, I exhort all good citizens, as they regard our national reputation; as they respect their own laws, and the laws of nations; as they value the blessings of peace and the welfare of their country, to discountenance and prevent, by all lawful means, any such enterprise; and I call upon every officer of this government, civil or military, to use all efforts in his power to arrest, for trial and punishment, every such offender against the laws providing for the performance of our sacred obligations to friendly powers.
Given under my hand, the 11th day of August, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and forty-nine, and the seventy-fourth of the Independence of the United States.

States is authorized to establish such ports of delivery in the collection dis-

trict created by that act, not exceeding two in number, (one of which shall be located on Fuget's Sound,) as he may deem proper: --

TREATY WITH THE WYANDOT INDIANS.
Articles of a Convention concluded in the city of Washington, this first day of April, one thousand eight hundred and fifty, by and between Ardavan S. Loughery, Commissioner especially appointed by the President of the United States, and the undersigned, Head Chief and Deputies of the Wyandot Tribe of Indians, duly authorized and empowered to act for their tribe.

April 1, 1850. Consent of Senate Sept. 24, 1850.
Proclamation made Sept 30, 1850.

[Wher eas , the people composing the Wyandot tribe or nation of Indians have manifested an anxious desire to extinguish their tribal or national character and become citizens of the United States -- believing their condition will, thereby, not only be ameliorated, but their welfare and prosperity greatly promoted. They have arrived at this conviction in view of the fact that a new territory will, at no distant period, be organized by the government of the United States, which will embrace within its limits their present lands and possessions, and thus they will again be surrounded by citizens of the United States. After a full consultation with their people, and upon mature reflection, the undersigned, representatives of the Wyandot nation, entertain the belief, that the evil effects always to be apprehended from such a state of things will be avoided by their becoming citizens of the United States, and having the lands and other property accruing under treaty stipula-
tions, now held in common by their people, fairly and equally divided - among the individual owners, and secured to them in severalty :
And, whereas, by the first article of the treaty concluded between the United States and the Wyandot nation or tribe of Indians, on the 17th day of March, one thousand eight hundred and forty-two, the said nation ceded and relinquished to the United States all the lands and possessions owned or claimed by them, within the limits of the States of Ohio and Michigan--in consideration of which cession, the
United States, by the second article of the treaty aforesaid, stipulate and agree to " grant to the Wyandot nation a tract of land west of the
Mississippi River, to contain one hundred and forty-eight thousand acres, and to be located upon any lands owned by the United States, now set apart, or may in future set apart, for Indian use, and not already assigned to any other tribe or nation." And in further consideration of the aforesaid cession by the Wyandot nation, the United States, by the third and succeeding articles of said treaty, agree " to pay the Wyandot nation a perpetual annuity of seventeen thousand five hundred dollars ($17,500) in specie," beside making other provision for the benefit of said nation, as follows : Blacksmith and assistant, $750 -- iron and steel for shop, $270 -- and for education purposes, $500--all of which to be furnished and paid annually. It being expressly stipulated in the 3d article of the treaty before mentioned,
that the annuity of seventeen thousand five hundred dollars should include " allformer annuities."
And, whereas, the Wyandot tribe of Indians were not put in possession of the one hundred and forty-eight thousand acres of land, as stipulated in the second article of the treaty aforesaid ; and they aver that, in consequence of the United States having failed to comply with that stipulation, by not designating and conveying to them a country fit for farming purposes and suited to their wants, they were compelled to purchase a home, of which they were then destitute, from another tribe of Indians. Accordingly, on the fourteenth day of December, one

thousand eight hundred and forty-three, they entered into a contract with the Delaware nation of Indians, by which they purchased of the last-mentioned nation a tract of land containing thirty-six sections, (or twenty-three thousand and forty acres,) and had granted to them, as a donation, three sections, (or nineteen hundred and twenty acres,) in addition, as set forth in the 1st and 2d articles of said contract or treaty, wherein these two tracts or sections of land are described as follows : " Three sections of land, containing six hundred and forty acres each, lying and being situated at the point of the junction of the Missouri and Kansas Rivers" -- and the " thirty-six sections of land, each containing 640 acres, situated between the aforesaid Missouri and Kansas Rivers, and adjoining on the west the aforesaid three donated sections, making in all thirty-nine sections of land, bounded as follows, viz. : Commencing at the point at the junction of the aforesaid Missouri and Kansas Rivers, running west along the Kansas River sufficiently far to include the aforesaid thirty-nine sections; thence running north to the Missouri River; thence down the said river with its meanders
to the place of beginning; to be surveyed in as near a square form as the rivers and territory ceded will admit of."
And, whereas, this said contract or treaty was ratified and confirmed by the United States, by a joint resolution of Congress, approved July 1848. res. 19. 25, 1848; and which contains only the following proviso : " That the Wyandot Indian nation shall take no better right or interest in and to
said lands than is now vested in the Delaware nation of Indians.'' The representatives of the Wyandot nation, therefore, present a
claim against the United States for the price of one hundred and fortyeight thousand acres of land granted by the 2d article of the aforesaid treaty of March 17, 1842, -- fixing that price at one dollar and twentyfive cents per acre, -- and which claim, they conceive, is strengthened, if not rendered valid, by the recognition of their purchase from the Delaware Indians on the part of the United States, as shown by the resolution confirmatory thereof, above cited. And they now ask that
the sum of one hundred and eighty-five thousand dollars be allowed and paid to the Wyandot people in commutation of said claim.
And, whereas, the commissioner on behalf of the United States, having carefully and attentively examined the application presented to him on behalf of the Wyandot nation, both in regard to their desire to become citizens of the United States, and of their claim for payment, in money, for the lands granted to them by the treaty of 1842; and having, also, examined the public documents and other proofs having reference to the subject, he is induced to believe, first, that the Wyandot people have so far advanced in civilization as to be capable, generally, of managing their own affairs, and are qualified and calculated to become useful citizens, a large portion whereof being already engaged in agricultural pursuits; and, secondly,that they have an equitable claim on the United States for the value of the lands granted to them by the treaty of 1842, aforesaid, but of which lands they were not possessed, in compliance with the stipulations of said treaty. In arriving at this conclusion, however, it is expressly understood, that it is not to be considered as an admission by the United States of either the policy or expediency of commuting lands granted to Indian tribes under treaty stipulations, for money, or in fixing the value of such lands so as to serve as a precedent hereafter. But, under the peculiar circumstances of this case, and especially in view of the Wyandot tribe of Indians agreeing to extinguish their national existence, and become citizens of the United States, thereby relinquishing all claims now held, in their national or collective capacity, against the United States, the commissioner aforesaid has agreed with the Wyandot chief and deputies, parties hereto, to conclude the following articles, to wit:

TREATY WITH THE WYANDOTS. Apri l 1, 1850.

Arti cle I.
For and in consideration of the stipulations set forth in the following articles, the Wyandot tribe or nation of Indians hereby cede, relinquish, and forever quit claim to the United States all the right, title, and interest in the lands they now possess and occupy, or have ever possessed and held in common, either as original occupants of the soil, or acquired by virtue of treaty stipulations.

And in like manner do they relinquish all claims held by the Wyandot people, in their national or collective capacity, against the United States, either on account of annuities arising out of treaty stipulations, or of any other character or description whatsoever; and that, after the ratification of this treaty in the manner before mentioned, they will have no claim to be recognized by the government of the United States in their tribal or national capacity, except so far as it may be necessary to carry into effect the several stipulations of this treaty.

Nov. 1, 1850. Preamble. 1828, ch. 111.
Discriminating luties of tonnage and impost discontinued as respects ships and imports of Chile.

Where as , by an act of the Congress of the United States of the twentyfourth of May, one thousand eight hundred and twenty-eight, entitled " An Act in addition to an act, entitled ` An Act concerning discriminating duties of tonnage and impost,' and to equalize the duties on Prussian vessels and their cargoes," it is provided that upon satisfactory evidence being given to the President of the United States, by the government of any foreign nation, that no discriminating duties of tonnage or impost are imposed or levied in the ports of the said nation, upon vessels wholly belonging to citizens of the United States, or upon the produce, manufactures, or merchandise, imported in the same, from the United States or from any foreign country, the President is thereby authorized to issue his proclamation, declaring that the foreign discriminating duties of tonnage and impost, within the United States, are, and
shall be, suspended and discontinued, so far as respects the vessels of the said foreign nation, and the produce, manufactures, or merchandise, imported into the United States in the same from the said foreign nation, or from any other foreign country; the said suspension to take effect from the time of such notification being given to the President of the United States, and to continue so long as the reciprocal exemption of vessels belonging to citizens of the United States, and their cargoes, as aforesaid, shall be continued, and no longer:
And whereas satisfactory evidence has lately been received by me, from the government of the Republic of Chile, through an official communication of Sefior Don Manuel Carvallo, accredited to this government as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of that Republic, under date of the thirty-first of October, 1850, that no other or higher duties of tonnage and impost are imposed or levied in the ports of Chile, upon vessels wholly belonging to citizens of the United States, and upon the produce, manufactures, or merchandise imported in the same from the United States, and from any foreign country whatever, than are levied on Chilean ships and their cargoes, in the same ports, and under like circumstances:
Now, therefore, I, Millard Fillmore, President of the United States of America, do hereby declare and proclaim, that so much of the several acts imposing discriminating duties of tonnage and impost within the United States, are, and shall be, suspended and discontinued, so far as respects the vessels of Chile, and the produce, manufactures, and merchandise imported into^the United States in the same, from Chile and from any other foreign country whatever; the said suspension to take effect from the day above mentioned, and to continue thenceforward, so long as the reciprocal exemption of the vessels of the United States, and the produce, manufactures, and merchandise, imported into Chile in the same, as aforesaid, shall be continued on the part of the govern-
