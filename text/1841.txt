fa) See notes of the decisions of the courts of the United States on the bankrupt act of April 4, 1800, vol. 2, 19.
In the case of Nelson, a petitioner in bankruptcy, in the Kentucky district, and Carland, an opposing creditor, several points were adjourned by the district to the circuit court. Upon the hearing of the case in the circuit court, the district judge, as well as the justice of the Supreme Court, sat in the case ; and,

ruptcy, as follows: All persons whatsoever, residing in any State, District or Territory of the United States, owing debts, which shall not have been created in consequence of a defalcation as a public officer; or as executor, administrator, guardian or trustee, or while acting in any other fiduciary capacity, who shall, by petition, setting forth to the * est of his knowledge and belief, a list of his or their creditors, their i?spective places of residence, and the amount due to each, together with an accurate inventory of his or their property, rights, and credits, of every name, kind, and description, and the location and situation of each and every parcel and portion thereof, verified by oath, or, if con-
scientiously scrupulous of taking an oath, by solemn affirmation, apply to the proper court, as hereinafter mentioned, for the benefit of this act, and therein declare themselves to be unable to meet their debts and engagements, shall be deemed bankrupts within the purview of this act, and may be so declared accordingly by a decree of such court; all persons, being merchants, or using the trade of merchandise, all retailers of merchandise, and all bankers, factors, brokers, underwriters, or marine insurers, owing debts to the amount of not less than two thousand

being opposed in opinion upon questions adjourned from the district court, they were certified to the Supreme Court on the motion of the counsel of the petitioner. Held, that the district judge cannot sit as a member of the circuit court, under the "Act to establish a uniform system of bankruptcy throughout the United States." Consequently, the points adjourned could not be brought before the Supreme Court on a certificate of division. Nelson v. Carland, 17 Peters' Rep., 181; S. C., 1 Howard, 265.
An appeal or writ of error will not lie from the decision of the circuit court, in a case of bankruptcy, adjourned from the district court. The decision of the circuit court is conclusive on the district judge. Ibid.
Under the late bankrupt act of the United States, the existence of a fiduciary debt, contracted before the passage of the act, constitutes no objection to the discharge of the debtor from other debts. Chapman v. Forsyth, 2 Howard, 202.
A factor, who receives the money of his principal, is not a fiduciary, within the meaning of the act. Ibid.
A bankrupt is bound to state, upon his schedule, the nature of a debt if it be a fiduciary one. Should he omit to do so, he would be guilty of a fraud, and his discharge will not avail him ; but if a creditor, in such case, proves his debt and receives a dividend from the estate, he is estopped from afterwards saying that his debt was not within the law. Ibid.
But if the fiduciary creditor does not prove his debt, he may recover it afterwards from the discharged bankrupt, by showing that it was within the exceptions of the act. Ibid.
In Kentucky, the creditor obtains a lien upon the property of his debtor by the delivery of afi.fa. to the sheriff; and this lien is as absolute before the levy as it is afterwards. Savage's Assignee v. Best, 3 Howard, 111.
Therefore, a creditor is not deprived of this lien by an act of bankruptcy on the part of the debtor committed before the levy is made, but after the execution is in the hands of the sheriff. Ibid.
This court has no revising power over the decrees of the district court sitting in bankruptcy ; nor is it authorized to issue a writ of prohibition to it in any case, except where the district is proceeding as a court of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. Ex parte Christy, 3 Howard, 292.
The district court, when sitting in bankruptcy, has jurisdiction over liens and mortgages existing upon the property of a bankrupt, so as to inquire into their validity and extent, and grant the same relief which the state courts might or ought to grant. Ibid.
The control of the district court over proceedings in the state courts upon such liens, is exercised, not over the state courts themselves, but upon the parties, through an injunction or other appropriate proceeding in equity. Ibid.
The design of the bankrupt act was to secure a prompt and effectual administration of the estate of all bankrupts, worked out by the courts of the United States, without the assistance of state tribunals. Ibid.
The phrase in the 6th section, " any creditor or creditors who shall claim any debt or demand under the bankruptcy," does not mean only such creditors who come in and prove their debts, but all creditors who have a present subsisting claim upon the bankrupt's estate, whether they have a security or mortgage therefor, or not. Ibid.
Such creditors have a right to ask that the property mortgaged shall be sold, and the proceeds applied towards the payment of their debts; and the assignee, on the other hand, may contest their claims. Ibid.
In the case of a contested claim, the district court has jurisdiction, if resort be had to a formal bill in equity or other plenary proceeding ; and also jurisdiction to proceed summarily. Ibid.
The principles established in the case of Ex parte the City Bank of New Orleans in the matter of Christy, assignee of Walden, reviewed and confirmed. Ibid.
But this court does not decide whether or not the jurisdiction of the district court over all the property of a bankrupt, mortgaged or otherwise, is exclusive, so as to take it away from the state courts in such cases. Norton's Assignee v. Boyd, 3 Howard, 426.
Where the defendant below became a bankrupt, the Supreme Court will not award a supersedeas to stay an execution, because the assignee of the bankrupt has his remedy in the circuit court. Black Zacharie, 3 Howard, 483.

rupt, at the instance of a creditor, may, at his election, by petition to such court within ten days after its decree, be entitled to a trial by jury before such court, to ascertain the fact of such bankruptcy; or if such person shall reside at a great distance from the place of holding such court, the said judge, in his discretion, may direct such trial by jury to be had in the county of such person's residence, in such manner, and under such directions, as the said court may prescribe and give; and all such decrees passed by such court, and not so re-examined, shall be deemed final and conclusive as to the subject-matter thereof.
Sec . 2. And be it further enacted, That all future payments, securities, conveyances, or transfers of property, or agreements made or given by any bankrupt, in contemplation of bankruptcy, and for the purpose of giving any creditor, endorser, surety, or other person, any preference or priority over the general creditors of such bankrupts; and all other payments, securities, conveyances, or transfers of property, or agreements made or given by such bankrupt in contemplation of bankruptcy, to any person or persons whatever, not being a bona fide creditor or purchaser, for a valuable consideration, without notice, shall
be deemed utterly void, and a fraud upon this act; and the assignee under the bankruptcy shall be entitled to claim, sue for, recover, and receive the same as part of the assets of the bankruptcy; and the person making such unlawful preferences and payments shall receive no discharge under the provisions of this act: Provided, That all dealings and transactions by and with any bankrupt, bona fide made and entered into more than two months before the petition filed against him, or by him, shall not be invalidated or affected by this act: Provided, That the other party to any such dealings or transactions had no notice of a
prior act of bankruptcy, or of the intention of the bankrupt to take the benefit of this act. And in case it shall be made to appear to the court, in the course of the proceedings in bankruptcy, that the bankrupt, his application being voluntary, has, subsequent to the first day of January last, or at any other time, in contemplation of the passage of a bankrupt law, by assignments or otherwise, given or secured any preference to one creditor over another, he shall not receive a discharge unless the
same be assented to by a majority in interest of those of his creditors who have not been so preferred: And provided, also, That nothing in this act contained shall be construed to annul, destroy, or impair any lawful rights of married women, or minors, or any liens, mortgages, or other securities on property, real or personal, which may be valid by the laws of the States respectively, and which are not inconsistent with the provisions of the second and fifth sections of this act.

And such bankrupt shall at all times be subject to examination, orally, or upon written interrogatories, in and before such court, or any commission appointed by the court therefor, on oath, or, if conscientiously scrupulous of taking an oath, upon his solemn affirmation, in all matters relating to such bankruptcy, and his acts and doings, and his property and rights of property, which, in the judgment of such court, are necessary and proper for the purposes of justice; and if in any such examination, he shall wilfully and corruptly answer, or swear, or affirm, falsely, he shall be deemed guilty of perjury, and shall be punishable therefor, in like manner as the crime of perjury is now punishable by the laws of the United States; and such discharge and certificate, when duly granted, shall, in all courts
of justice, be deemed a full and complete discharge of all debts, contracts, and other engagements of such bankrupt, which are proveable under this act, and shall be and may be pleaded as a full and complete bar to all suits brought in any court of judicature whatever, and the same shall be conclusive evidence of itself in favor of such bankrupt, unless the same shall be impeached for some fraud or wilful concealment by him of his property or rights of property, as aforesaid, contrary to the provisions of this act, on prior reasonable notice specifying in writing such fraud or concealment; and if, in any case of bankruptcy,
a majority, in number and value, of the creditors who shall have proved their debts at the time of hearing of the petition of the bankrupt for a discharge as hereinbefore provided, shall at such hearing file their writ-
ten dissent to the allowance of a discharge and certificate to such bankrupt, or if, upon such hearing, a discharge shall not be decreed to him, the bankrupt may demand a trial by jury upon a proper issue to be directed by the court, at such time and place, and in such manner, as the court may order; or he may appeal from that decision, at any time within ten days thereafter, to the circuit court next to be held for the same district, by simply entering in the district court, or with the clerk thereof, upon record, his prayer for an appeal. The appeal shall be tried at the first term of the circuit court after it be taken, unless, for sufficient reason, a continuance be granted; and it may be heard and determined by said court summarily, or by a jury, at the option of the bankrupt; and the creditors may appear and object against a decree of discharge and the allowance of the certificate, as hereinbefore provided. And if, upon a full hearing of the parties, it shall appear to the satisfaction of the court, or the jury shall find that the bankrupt has made a full disclosure and surrender of all his estate, as by this act required, and has in all things conformed to the directions thereof, the
court shall make a decree of discharge, and grant a certificate, as pro-
vided in this act. Sec . 5. And be itfurther enacted, That all creditors coming in and
proving their debts under such bankruptcy, in the manner hereinafter prescribed, the same being bona fide debts, shall be entitled to share in the bankrupt's property and effects, pro rata, without any priority or preference whatsoever, except only for debts due by such bankrupt to the United States, and for all debts due by him to persons who, by the laws of the United States, have a preference, in consequence of having

paid moneys as his sureties, which shall be first paid out of the assets; and any person who shall have performed any labor as an operative in
the service of any bankrupt shall be entitled to receive the full amount of the wages due to him for such labor, not exceeding twenty-five dollars ; Provided, That such labor shall have been performed within six months next before the bankruptcy of his employer; and all creditors whose debts are not due and payable until a future day, all annuitants, holders of bottomry and respondentia bonds, holders of policies of insurances, sureties, endorsers, bail, or other persons, having uncertain or contingent demands against such bankrupt, shall be permitted to come in and prove such debts or claims under this act, and shall have a right, when their debts and claims become absolute, to have the same allowed them; and such annuitants and holders of debts payable in future may have the present value thereof ascertained, under the direc-
tion of such court, and allowed them accordingly, as debts in present!; and no creditor or other person, coming in and proving his debt or other claim, shall be allowed to maintain any suit at law or in equity therefor, but shall be deemed thereby to have waived all right of action and suit against such bankrupt; and all proceedings already commenced, and all unsatisfied judgments already obtained thereon, shall be deemed to
be surrendered thereby; and in all cases where there are mutual debts or mutual credits between the parties, the balance only shall be deemed the true debt or claim between them, and the residue shall be deemed adjusted by the set-off; all such proof of debts shall be made before the court decreeing the bankruptcy, or before some commissioner appointed
by the court for that purpose; but such court shall have full power to set aside and disallow any debt, upon proof that such debt is founded in fraud, imposition, illegality, or mistake; and corporations to whom any debts are due, may make proof thereof by their president, cashier, treasurer, or other officer, who may be specially appointed for that purpose ; and in appointing commissioners to receive proof of debts, and perform
other duties^ under the provisions of this act, the said court shall appoint such persons as have their residence in the county in which the
bankrupt lives. Sec . 6. And be it further enacted, That the district court in every
district shall have jurisdiction in all matters and proceedings in bankruptcy arising under this act, and any other act which may hereafter be passed on the subject of bankruptcy; the said jurisdiction to be exer-
cised summarily, in the nature of summary proceedings in equity; and for this purpose the said district court shall be deemed always open. And the district judge may adjourn any point or question arising in any case in bankruptcy into the circuit court for the district, in his discre-
tion, to be there heard and determined; and for this purpose the circuit court of such district shall also be deemed always open. And the jurisdiction hereby conferred on the district court shall extend to all cases and controversies in bankruptcy arising between the bankrupt and any
creditor or creditors who shall claim any debt or demand under the bankruptcy; to all cases and controversies between such creditor or creditors and the assignee of the estate, whether in office or removed; to all cases and controversies between such assignee and the bankrupt, and to all acts, matters, and things to be done under and in virtue of the bankruptcy, until the final distribution and settlement of the estate of the bankrupt, and the close of the proceedings in bankruptcy. And the said courts shall have full authority and jurisdiction to compel obedience to all orders and decrees passed by them in bankruptcy, by pro-
cess of contempt and other remedial process, to the same extent the circuit courts may now do in any suit pending therein in equity. And it shall be the duty of the district court in each district, from time to

And the said courts shall, from time to time, prescribe a tariff or table of fees and charges to be taxed by the officers of the court or other persons, for services under this act, or any other on the subject of bankruptcy; which fees shall be as low as practicable, with reference to the nature and character of such services.

paid the same amount, pro rata, out of the remaining dividends or distributions thereafter made, as the other creditors have already received,
before the latter shall be entitled to any portion thereof. Sec . 11. And be it further enacted, That the assignee shall have full

And such assignee shall also have authority, by and under the order and direction of the proper court in bankruptcy, to compound any debts, or other claims, or securities due or belonging to the estate of the bankrupt; but no such order or direction shall be made until notice of the application is given in some public newspaper in the district, to be designated by the court, ten days at least before the hearing, so that all creditors and other persons in interest may appear and show cause, if any they have, at the hearing, why the order or direction
should not be passed. Sec . 12. And be it further enacted, That if any person, who shall
have been discharged under this act, shall afterward become bankrupt, he shall not again be entitled to a discharge under this act, unless his estate shall produce (after all charges) sufficient to pay every creditor

who are partners in trade, become insolvent, an order may be made in the manner provided in this act, either on the petition of such partners, or any one of them, or on the petition of any creditor of the partners; upon which order all the joint stock and property of the company, and also all the separate estate of each of the partners, shall be taken, excepting such parts thereof as are herein exempted; and all the creditors of the company, and the separate creditors of each partner, shall be allowed to prove their respective debts; and the assignees shall also keep separate accounts of the joint stock or property of the company, and of the separate estate of each member thereof; and after deducting out of the whole amount received by such assignees the whole of the expenses and disbursements paid by them, the nett proceeds of the joint stock shall be appropriated to pay the creditors of the company, and the
nett proceeds of the separate estate of each partner shall be appropriated to pay his separate creditors; and if there shall be any balance of the separate estate of any partner, after the payment of his separate debts, such balance shall be added to the joint stock, for the payment of the joint creditors; and if there shall be any balance of the joint stock, after payment of the joint debts, such balance shall be divided and appropriated to and among the separate estates of the several partners, according to their respective rights and interests therein, and as it would have been if the partnership had been dissolved without any bankruptcy; and the sum so appropriated to the separate estate of each partner shall be applied to the payment of his separate debts; and the certificate of discharge shall be granted or refused to each partner, as the same would or ought to be if the proceedings had been against him alone under this act; and in all other respects the proceedings against partners shall be conducted in the like manner as if they had been commenced and prosecuted against one person alone.

CONVENTION WITH PERU. March 17, 1841.

817

Note .-- The foregoing treaty is published in Foreign Treaties, Vol. I. p. 570. The reason for publishing it again, appears in the following extract from the proclamation of the President, of January 8, 1847: --

" And whereas the seventh article of the said Convention required that the ratifications of the contracting parties should be exchanged within two years from its date, which provision was not observed by
the said parties, owing to delays in the ratification rendering such exchange impracticable within the time stipulated; and whereas it appears that the duly constituted authorities of the Republic of Peru did, on the 21st of October, 1845, by law, approve in all respects the said Convention, with the condition, however, that the first annual
instalment of thirty thousand dollars on account of the principal of the debt recognized thereby, and to which the second article relates,
should begin from the 1st of January, 1846, and the interest on this annual sum, according to Article III., should be calculated and paid from the 1st of January, 1842; and whereas the said Convention, and the aforesaid modification thereof, have been duly ratified, and the respective ratifications of the same were exchanged in the city of Lima on the 31st day of October last, by Albert G. Jewett on the part of the United States, and Manuel del Rio on the part of the
Republic of Peru: " Now, therefore, be it known, that I, Jame s K. Polk , President
of the United States of America, have caused the said Convention, and the modification thereof, to be made public, to the end that the
same, and every article and clause thereof, may be observed and fulfilled with good faith by the United States and the citizens thereof."]

Ratifications not having been exchanged within the time prescribed by the 7th article, the constituted authorities of Peru did, on 21st October, 1845, approve ofsaid convention with certain conditions.
Ratifications exchanged 31st October, 1846.
Proclaimed 8th January, 1847.
