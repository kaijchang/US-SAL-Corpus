"5. The purpose of rehabilitation is to restore employability lost by virtue of a handicap due to service- incurred disability. The Administrator shall have the power and duty to cooperate with and employ the facilities of other governmental and State employment agencies for the purpose of placing in gainful employment persons trained under the provisions of this part.
"6. The Administrator is hereby authorized to make such rules and regulations as may be deemed necessary in order to promote good conduct and cooperation on the part of persons who are following courses of vocational rehabilitation provided by this part. Penalties for the breach of such rules and regulations may, with the approval of the Administrator, extend to a forfeiture by the offender for a period of three months of such portion of the pension herein provided as will leave him not less than the amount of the monthly pension or retirement pay to which such person is entitled for service -connected disability, and such penalties may also extend to permanent discontinuance of all further benefits of this part.
"7. The Administrator is hereby authorized to make such rules and regulations as may be deemed necessary for the granting of leaves of absence to those following courses of vocational rehabilitation provided by this part where in his opinion such leaves do not materially interfere with the pursuit of such courses.

" (4 ) In any case in which the period , or the time described in paragraph (3 ) , in respect of any wages is less than one week, the Commissioner, under regulations prescribed by him with the approval of the Secretary , may authorize an employer to determine the amount to be deducted and withheld under the tables
applicable in the case of a weekly payroll period, in which case the aggregate of the wages paid to the employee during the calendar week shall be considered the weekly wages.

"(5 ) If the wages exceed the highest wage bracket, in determining the amount to be deducted and withheld under this sub-
section, the wages may, at the election of the employer, be computed to the nearest dollar.

" (d) TAX PAID BY RECIPIENT.- If the employer, in violation of the provisions of this subchapter, fails to deduct and withhold the tax under this subchapter, and thereafter the tax against which such tax may be credited is paid, the tax so required to be deducted and withheld shall not be collected from the employer ; but this subsection shall in no case relieve the employer from liability for any penalties. or additions to the tax otherwise applicable in respect of such failure to deduct and withhold .

Ante, p. 129.

"(1 ) If furnished after the date of commencement of employment with the employer by reason of a change of status , shall take effect with respect to the first payment of wages made on or after the first status determination date which occurs at least
thirty days from the date on which such certificate is furnished to the employer, except that at the election of the employer such certificate may be made effective with respect to any previous payment of wages made on or after the date of the furnishing of such certificate. For the purposes of this paragraph the term 'status determination date' means January 1 and July 1 of each year.
"(2) If furnished otherwise than by reason of a change of status, shall take effect as of the beginning of the first payroll period ending, or the first payment of wages made without regard to a payroll period, on or after the date on which such certificate is furnished to the employer.
A certificate which takes effect under this subsection shall continue in
effect with respect to the employer until another such certificate furnished by the employee takes effect under this subsection . If no certificate is in effect under this subsection with respect to an employee, such employee shall be treated, for the purposes of the withholding exemption, or in case the employer exercises his election under section 1622 ( c ) (relating to wage bracket withholding ) , for the purpose of computing the amount to be deducted and withheld under such subsection, as a married person claiming none of the personal exemption for withholding and having no dependents.
"(i) OVERLAPPING PAY PERIODS , AND SO FORTH.-- If a payment of wages is made to an employee by an employer-
" (1 ) with respect to a payroll period or other period , any part of which is included in a payroll period or other period with respect to which wages are also paid to such employee by such employer, or
"( 2 ) without regard to any payroll period or other period , but on or prior to the expiration of a payroll period or other period with respect to which wages are also paid to such employee by such employer, or
" (3 ) with respect to a period beginning in one and ending in another calendar year, or

Quarterly estimates.

"(4 ) through an agent, fiduciary, or other person who also has the control, receipt, custody, or disposal of, or pays, the wages payable by another employer to such employee, the manner of withholding and the amount to be deducted and withheld under this subchapter shall be determined in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Commissioner with the approval of the Secretary under which the withholding exemption allowed to the employee in any calendar year shall approximate the withholding exemption allowable with respect to an annual payroll period. "(j) WITHHOLDING ON BASIS OF AVERAGE WAGES. -The Commissioner may, under regulations prescribed by him with the approval of the Secretary, authorize employers ( 1 ) to estimate the wages which

57 STAT. ]

78TH CONG. , 1ST SESS.-CH, 120-JUNE 9, 1943

137

will be paid to any employee in any quarter of the calendar year, ( 2 ) to determine the amount to be deducted and withheld upon each payment of wages to such employee during such quarter as if the appropriate average of the wages so estimated constituted the actual wages paid, and (3 ) to deduct and withhold upon any payment of wages to such employee during such quarter such amount as may be necessary to adjust the amount actually deducted and withheld upon the wages of such employee during such quarter to the amount required to be deducted and withheld during such quarter without regard to this subsection.

"SEC. 1623. LIABILITY FOR TAX.
"The employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax required to be deducted and withheld under this subchapter, and shall not be liable to any person for the amount of any such payment.

"SEC. 1624. RETURN AND PAYMENT BY GOVERNMENTAL EMPLOYER.
