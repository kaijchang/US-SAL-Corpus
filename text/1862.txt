August six, eighteen hundred and sixty-one.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the act entitled " An act to create a Metropolitan police district of the District of Columbia, and to establish a police therefor," approved August six, eighteen hundred and sixty-one, be, and the same is hereby, amended as follows :
Sec . 1. And be it further enacted, That all property, or money alleged or supposed to have been feloniously obtained, or which shall be lost or abandoned, and which shall be thereafter taken into the custody of any member of the Metropolitan police force, or criminal court of the District of Columbia, or which shall come into custody of any justice of the peace, shall be, by such member or justice, or by order of said court, given into the custody of and kept by an officer, who shall be appointed and may be removed by the Board of Police, known as "property clerk" of the Metropolitan police district, and all such property and money shall be particularly registered by said property clerk in a book kept for that purpose, which shall contain also a record of the names of the persons from whom such property or money was taken, the names of all claimants thereto, the time of the seizure, and any final disposition of such property and money. Whenever property or money shall be taken from persons arrested, and shall be alleged to have been feloniously obtained, or to be the proceeds of crime, and whenever so brought with such claimant and the person arrested before some magistrate for adjudication, and the magistrate shall be then and there satisfied from evidence that the person arrested is innocent of the offence alleged, and that the property rightfully belongs to him, then said magistrate may thereupon, in writing, order such property or money to be returned, and the property clerk, if he have it, to deliver such property or money to the accused person himself, and not to any attorney, agent, or clerk of such accused person. If any claim to the ownership of such property or money shall be made on oath before the magistrate, by or in behalf of any other persons than the persons arrested, and the said accused person shall be held for trial or examination, such property or money shall remain in the custody of the property clerk until the discharge or conviction of the persons accused. All property or money taken on suspicion of having been feloniously obtained, or of being the proceeds of crime, and for which there is no other claimant than the person from whom such property was taken, and all lost property coming into the possession of any member of the said Metropolitan police force, and all property and money taken from pawnbrokers as the proceeds of crime, or by any such member from persons supposed to be insane, intoxicated, or otherwise incapable of taking care of themselves, shall be transmitted as soon as practicable to the property clerk of the Metropolitan police district, to be duly registered and advertised for the benefit of all persons and parties interested, and for the information of the public as to the amount and disposition of the property so taken into custody by the police. All property and money that shall remain in the custody of the property clerk for the period of six months without any lawful claimant thereto, after having been three times advertised in public newspapers, shall be sold at public auction, and the proceeds of such sale shall be paid into the policemen's fund: Provided, That horses and other animals taken by the police and remaining

unclaimed for twenty days may be advertised and sold upon ten days' public notice, and all perishable property to be sold at once. If any property or money placed in the custody of the property clerk shall be desired as evidence in any police or other criminal court, such property shall be delivered to any officer who shall present an order to that effect from such court; such property, however, shall not be retained in said court, but shall be returned to said property clerk, to be disposed of according to the previous provisions of this act. And the annual compensation of said property clerk, as also the clerk (who shall hereafter be known as secretary of the
board of police) shall be twelve hundred dollars each, payable monthly. Sec . 2. And be it further enacted, That it shall be the duty of the
Board of Metropolitan Police to set apart a sanitary police company, to consist of not exceeding ten persons, who shall be selected from among the police, and to assign to said company such especial duties, by the

The Metropolitan sanitary company is hereby empowered, under such distribution of power and duty as may be made by the rules and regulations, to visit and make
inspection of all ferry-boats, manufactories, slaughter-houses, tenementhouses, and edifices suspected of, or charged with, being unsafe, and to attend to such other matters relating to health as are complained of and entered upon the complaint-book kept by order of the board, and to take all necessary legal measures for promoting the security of life or health generally, and upon or in said boats, manufactories, houses, and edifices, and to make report of inspection and action in the premises to the Board of Metropolitan Police. Whenever said board shall be satisfied, by such report, that any ferry-boat, manufactory, slaughter-house, tenement-house, or edifice is maintained,or that any other act is being about to be committed, in a manner prejudicial to the lives or health of the public, it shall, after due entry upon its minutes of the circumstances, cause complaint to be made, founded upon such report and circumstances, before any magistrate of the Metropolitan police district, who shall, in a summary way, upon such complaint made under oath, issue his proper warrant, reciting therein the name of the member or members of the Metropolitan sanitary police company, for the arrest of the person in charge of said ferry-boat, manufactory, slaughter-house, tenement-house, and edifice, or otherwise committing any act that may be derogatory to the public health, to the end that he may be brought before such magistrate, and the complaint of insecurity of the life or health of the public so made be duly investigated according to the law of examination into misdemeanors. If said magistrate shall be satisfied, on a summary hearing thereof, that such charge of insecurity of the lives or health of the public is founded on reasonable and probable cause, he may, by his order in writing, command any such ferry-boat to cease running, or any business in such manufactory or slaughter-house to cease, or impose such fine as by law may be attached to such offence upon the person so offending, until the cause of complaint aforesaid shall be removed to the satisfaction of the Board of Metropolitan Police.
Sec . 3. And be it further enacted, That if any member of the Metropolitan police force, or if any two or more house-holders shall report in writing, under his or their signature, to the superintendent of the Metropolitan police force that there are good grounds (and stating the same) for believing any house, room, or premises within the said Metropolitan
police district to be kept or used as a common gaming house, common gaming room, or common gaming premises, for therein playing for wagers of money at any game of chance, or to be kept or used as a bawdy house, or for lewd and obscene public amusement or entertainment, or as a house

Treaty of Commerce and Navigation between the United States and the Ottoman Empire. Concluded at Constantinople, February 25, 1862. Ratifications exchanged at Constantinople, June 5, 1862. Proclaimed by the President of the United States, July 2, 1862.
BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: Feb. 25, 1862.

A PROCLAMATION.
Whereas a treaty of commerce and navigation between the United States of America and the Ottoman Empire was concluded and signed by their respective plenipotentiaries at Constantinople on the twenty-fifth day of February last, which treaty, in the English language, is word for word as follows:

Preamble.

Treaty of Commerce and Navigation between the United States of America and the Ottoman Empire.

The United States of America on the one part, and' His Imperial Majesty the Sultan of the Ottoman empire on the other part, being equally animated by the desire of extending the commercial relations between
their respective countries, have agreed, for this purpose, to conclude a treaty of commerce and navigation, and have named as their respective plenipotentiaries, that is to say : The President of the United States of America, Edward Joy Morris, minister resident at the Sublime Porte; and His Imperial Majesty the Sultan of the Ottoman empire, his highness Mehemed Emin Aali Pacha, minister of foreign affairs, decorated with the imperial orders of the Ottomanich in Brilliants, Majidich, and order of Merit of the First Class, and the grand crosses of several foreign orders ; who, after having communicated to each other their respective full powers, found in good and due form, have agreed upon the following articles:
Art ic le I. All rights, privileges, and immunities, which have been conferred on the citizens or vessels of the United States of America by the treaty already existing between the United States of America and the Ottoman empire, are confirmed, now and forever, with the exception of those clauses of the said treaty which it is the object of the present treaty to modify; and it is, moreover, expressly stipulated that all rights, privileges, or immunities, which the Sublime Porte now grants, or may hereafter grant to, or suffer to be enjoyed by the subjects, ships, commerce, or navigation of any other foreign power, shall be equally granted to and exercised and enjoyed by the citizens, vessels, commerce, and navigation of the United States of America.
Art ic le II. The citizens of the United States of America, or their agents, shall be permitted to purchase, at all places in the Ottoman empire and its possessions, (whether for the purposes of internal trade or of exportation,) all articles, without any exception whatsoever, the produce
or manufacture of the said empire and possessions ; and the Sublime Porte having, in virtue of the second article of the convention of commerce, of the 16th of August, 1838, with Great Britain, formally engaged to abolish all monopolies of agricultural produce, or of every other articles whatsoever, as well as all " permits " (tezkerehs) from the local governors, either for the purchase of any article, or for its removal from one place to another when purchased, any attempt to compel the citizens of

Contracting parties.
Plenipotentiaries.
Rights under former treaties confirmed, except, &c.
Privileges of most favored nation to be granted to the United States.
Citizens ot United States may purchase a 6 articles, &c.
Permits from local governors no longer allowed.

1214 TREATY WITH THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE. Feb ru ar y 25, 1862.

Internal duties in Turkey.
Export duties from Turkey.
Prohibitions to be same as, &c.
Eight per cent, export duty may be charged.
To be reduced. Transport luties and prohibitions.
Import duties not to exceed eight per cent.

the United States of America to receive such " permits " from the local governors shall be considered as an infraction of this treaty, and the Sublime Porte shall immediately punish with severity any viziers, or other officers, who shall have been guilty of such misconduct, and shall render full justice to citizens of the United States of America for all losses or injuries which they may duly prove themselves to have suffered thereby.
Art ic le III. If any articles of Ottoman produce or manufacture be purchased by citizens of the United States of America, or their agents, for the purpose of selling the same for internal consumption in Turkey, the said citizens, or their agents, shall pay at the purchase and sale of such articles, and in any manner of trade therein, the same duties that are paid in similar circumstances by the most favored class of Ottoman subjects, or of foreigners in the internal trade of the Ottoman empire.
Art ic le IV. No other or higher duties or charges shall be imposed in the dominions and possessions of either of the contracting parties, on the exportation of any article to the dominions and possessions of the other, than such as are or may be payable on the exportation of the like article to any other foreign country ; nor shall any prohibition be imposed on the exportation of any article from the dominions and possessions of either of the two contracting powers to the dominions and possessions of the other, which shall not equally extend to the exportation of the like article to any other country.
No charge or duty whatsoever will be demanded on any article of Ottoman produce or manufacture purchased by citizens of the United States of America, or their agents, either at the place where such article is purchased or in its transit from that place to the place whence it is exported, at which it will be subject to an export duty not exceeding eight per cent., calculated on the value at the place of shipment, and payable on exportation ; and all articles which shall once have paid this duty shall not again
be liable to the same duty, however they may have changed hands within any part of the Ottoman empire.
It is furthermore agreed, that the duty of eight per cent, above mentioned will be annually reduced by one per cent, until it shall be, in this manner, finally reduced to a fixed duty of one per cent, ad valorem, destined to cover the general expenses of administration and control.
Arti cle V. No other or higher duties shall be imposed on the importation into the United States of America of any article the produce or manufacture of the dominions and possessions of His Imperial Majesty the Sultan, from whatever place arriving, whether by sea or by land; and no other or higher duties shall be imposed on the importation into the dominions and possessions of His Imperial Majesty, of any article the produce or manufacture of the United States of America, from whatever place arriving, than are or may be payable on the like article the produce or manufacture of any other foreign country ; nor shall any prohibition be
maintained or imposed on the importation of any article, the produce or manufacture of the dominions and possessions of either of the contracting parties, into the dominions and possessions of the other, which shall not equally extend to the importation of the like articles, being the produce or manufacture of any other country.
His Imperial Majesty further engages that, save as hereinafter excepted, he will not prohibit the importation into his dominions and possessions of any article the produce and manufacture of the United States of America, from whatever place arriving; and that the duties to be imposed on every article the produce or manufacture of the United States of America imported into the empire and possessions of His Imperial Majesty the Sultan, shall in no case exceed one fixed rate of eight per cent, ad valorem, or a specific duty, fixed by common consent, equivalent thereto. Such rate shall be calculated upon the value of such articles

TREATY WITH THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE. Feb ru ar y 25, 1862. 1215

at the wharf, and shall be payable at the time of their being landed, if brought by sea, or at the first custom-house they may reach, if brought
by land. If these articles, after having paid the import duty of eight per cent.,
are sold either at the place of their arrival or in the interior of the country, neither the buyer nor the seller shall be charged with any further duty in respect to them; and if such articles should not be sold for consumption in the Ottoman empire, but should be reexported within the space of six months, the same shall be considered as merchandise in transit by land, and be treated as is stated hereinafter in Article XII. of this treaty; the administration of the customs being bound to restore, at the time of their reexportation, to the merchant, who shall be required to furnish proof that the goods in question have paid the import duty of eight per cent., the difference between that duty and the duty levied on goods in transit by land, as set forth in the article above cited.
Art ic le VI. It is understood that any article the produce or manufacture of a foreign country intended for importation into the United Principalities of Moldo-Wallachia, or into the principality of Servia, which shall pass through any other part of the Ottoman empire, will not be liable to the payment of customs duty until it reaches those principalities ; and, on the other band, that any article of foreign produce or manufacture passing through those principalities, but destined for some other part of the Ottoman empire, will not be liable to the payment of customs duty until such article reaches the first custom-house under the direct adminis-
tration of the Sublime Porte. The same course shall be followed with respect to any article the
produce or manufacture of those principalities, as well as with respect to any article the produce or manufacture of any other portion of the Ottoman empire, intended for exportation; such articles will be liable to the payment of customs duties -- the former to the custom-house of the aforesaid principalities, and the latter to the Ottoman custom-house; the object being that neither import nor export duties shall in any case be payable more than once.
Art ic le VII. The subjects and citizens of the contracting parties shall enjoy, in the dominions and possessions of the other, equality of treatment with native subjects or citizens in regard to warehousing, and also in regard to bounties, facilities, and drawbacks.
Art ic le VIII. All articles which are, or may be, legally importable into the United States of America, in vessels of the United States, may likewise be imported in Ottoman vessels without being liable to any other or higher duties or charges, of whatever denomination, than if such articles were imported in vessels of the United States ; and, reciprocally, all articles which are or may be legally importable into the dominions and possessions of His Imperial Majesty the Sultan in Ottoman vessels, may likewise be imported in vessels of the United States without being liable to any other or higher duties or charges, of whatever denomination, than if such articles were imported in Ottoman vessels. Such reciprocal equality of treatment shall take effect without distinction, whether such articles come directly from the place of origin or from any other country. In the same manner there shall be perfect equality of treatment in regard to exportation, so that the same export duties shall be paid, and the same bounties and drawbacks allowed in the dominions and possessions of either of the contracting parties on the exportation of any article which is, or may be, legally exportable therefrom, whether such exportation shall take place in Ottoman or in vessels of the United States, and whatever may be the place of destination, whether a port of either of the contracting parties, or of any third power.
Art ic le IX. No duties of tonnage, harbor, pilotage, light-house, quarantine, or other similar or corresponding duties of whatever nature, or

Imports for prin cipauties.
Citizens of each country to enjoy equal privileges as to warehousing, &c.

under whatever denomination, levied in the name or for the profit of government, public functionaries, private individuals, corporations, or es tablishments of any kind, shall be imposed in the ports of the dominions and possessions of either country upon the vessels of the other country which shall not equally, and under the same conditions, be imposed in the like cases on national vessels in general.
Such equality of treatment shall apply reciprocally to the respective vessels, from whatever port or place they may arrive and whatever may be their place of destination.
Art ic le X. All vessels, which, according to the laws of the United States, are to be deemed vessels of the United States, and all vessels which, according to Ottoman laws, are to be deemed Ottoman vessels, shall, for the purposes of this treaty, be deemed vessels of the United States and Ottoman vessels, respectively.
Arti cle XI. No charge whatsoever shall be made upon goods of the United States, being the produce or manufacture of the United States of America, whether in vessels of the United States, or other vessels, nor upon any goods the produce or manufacture of any other foreign country carried in vessels of the United States, when the same shall pass through the Straits of the Dardanelles, or of the Bosphorus, whether such goods shall pass through those straits in the vessels that brought them, or shall have been transhipped to other vessels; or whether, after having been sold for exportation, they shall, for a certain limited time, be landed in order to be placed in other vessels for the continuance of their voyage. In the latter case, the goods in question shall be deposited at Constantinople, in the magazines of the custom-house, called transit magazines; and in any other places where there is no entrepot, they shall be placed under the charge of the administration of the customs.
Arti cle XII. The Sublime Porte, desiring to grant, by means of gradual concessions, all facilities in its power to transit by land, it is stipulated and agreed that the duty of three per cent, levied up to this time on articles imported into the Ottoman empire, in their passage through the Ottoman empire to other countries, shall be reduced to two per cent, payable as the duty of three per cent, has been paid hitherto, on arriving in the Ottoman dominions; and at the end of eight years, to be reckoned from the day of the exchange of the ratifications of the present treaty, to a fixed and definite tax of one per cent., which shall be levied, as is to be the case with respect to Ottoman produce exported, to defray the expense of registration.
The Sublime Porte, at the same time, declares that it reserves to itself the right to establish, by a special enactment, the measures to be adopted
for the prevention of fraud. Art ic le XIII. Citizens of the United States of America, or their
agents, trading in goods the produce or manufacture of foreign countries, shall be subject to the same taxes, and enjoy the same rights, privileges, and immunities, as foreign subjects dealing in goods the produce or manufacture of their own country.
Arti cle XIV. An exception to the stipulations laid down in the Vth Article shall be made in regard to tobacco in any shape whatsoever, and also in regard to salt, which two articles shall cease to be included among those which the citizens of the United States of America are
permitted to import into the Ottoman dominions. Citizens of the United States, however, or their agents, buying or
selling tobacco or salt for consumption in the Ottoman empire, shall be subject to the same regulations and shall pay the same duties as the most favored Ottoman subjects trading in the two articles aforesaid; and furthermore, as a compensation for the prohibition of the two articles above mentioned, no duty whatsoever shall in future be levied on those articles when exported from the Ottoman empire by citizens oi
the United States.

TREATY WITH THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE. Feb ru ar y 25, 1862. 1217

Citizens of the United States shall, nevertheless, be bound to declare

the quantity of tobacco and salt thus exported to the proper custom-house

authorities, who shall, as heretofore, have the right to watch over the

export of these articles, without thereby being entitled to levy any tax

thereon on any pretence whatsoever.

Arti cle XV. It is understood between the two contracting parties Importation of that the Sublime Porte reserves to itself the faculty and right of issuing gunpowder, &c.,
may be prohibit-
a general prohibition against the importation into the Ottoman empire ed.

of gunpowder, cannon, arms of war, or military stores, but such prohibition

will not come into operation until it shall have been officially notified,

and will apply only to the articles mentioned in the decree enacting

the prohibition. Any of these articles which have not been so specifically

prohibited shall, on being imported into the Ottoman empire, be subject

to the local regulations, unless the legation of the United States of

America shall think fit to apply for a special license, which will in

that case be granted, provided no valid objection thereto can be alleged.

of the exchange of the ratifications; and each of the two contracting

parties being, however, at liberty to give to the other, at the end of

14 [fourteen] years, (that time being fixed, as the provisions of this treaty

will then have come into full force,) notice for its revision, or for its

determination at the expiration of a year from the date of that notice, and

so again at the end of 21 [twenty-one] years.

The present treaty shall receive its execution in all and every one

of the provinces of the Ottoman empire; that is to say, in all the

possessions of His Imperial Majesty the Sultan, situated in Europe or

in Asia, in Egypt, and in the other parts of Africa belonging to the

Sublime Porte, in Servia, and in the united principalities of Moldavia

and Wallachia.

Arti cle XXI. It is always understood that the government of

the United States of America does not pretend', by any article in the

present treaty, to stipulate for more than the plain and fair construction

of the terms employed, nor to preclude in any manner the Ottoman

government from the exercise of its rights of internal administration

where the exercise of these rights does not evidently infringe upon

the privileges accorded by ancient treaties or by the present treaty to

citizens of the United States or their merchandise.

Art ic le XXII. The high contracting parties have agreed to appoint,

jointly, commissioners for the settlement of a tariff of custom-house duties,

to be levied in conformity with the stipulations of the present treaty, as

well upon merchandise of every description, being the produce or manu-

facture of the United States of America, imported into the Ottoman

empire, as upon articles of every description the produce or manufacture

of the Ottoman empire and its possessions, which citizens of the United

States or their agents are free to purchase in any part of the Ottoman

empire for exportation to the United States or to any other country. The

new tariff, to be so concluded, shall remain in force during seven years,

dating from the date of the exchange of the ratifications.

Each of the contracting parties shall have the right, a year before the

expiration of that term, to demand the revision of the tariff. But if, dur-

ing the seventh year, neither the one nor the other of the contracting

parties shall avail itself of this right the tariff then existing shall continue

to have the force of law for seven years more, dating from the day of the

expiration of the seven preceding years ; and the same shall be the case

with respect to every successive period of seven years.

Art ic le XXIII. The present treaty shall be ratified and the ratifi-

cations shall be exchanged at Constantinople in three calendar months, or

sooner, if possible, and shall be carried into execution when ratified.

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:
A PROCLAMATION.

April 7, 1862. Ante, p. 531.

Whe re as a treaty between the United States of America and her Majesty the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland was concluded and signed by their respective Plenipotentiaries, at the city of Washington, on the seventh day of April last, which treaty is, word for word, as follows :

Preamble.

Treaty between the United States of America and her Majesty the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, for the suppression of the African slave trade.

The United States of America and her Majesty the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, being desirous to render more effectual the means hitherto adopted for the suppression of the slave trade carried on upon the coast of Africa, have deemed it expedient to conclude a treaty for that purpose, and have named as their Plenipotentiaries, that is to say :
The President of the United States of America, William H. Seward, Secretary of State ;
And her Majesty the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the right honorable Richard Bickerton Pemell, Lord Lyons, a peer of her United Kingdom, a knight grand cross of her most honorable Order of the Bath, and her Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the United States of America ;
Who, after having communicated to each other their respective full
powers, found in good and due form, have agreed upon and concluded the following articles:
Art ic le I. The two high contracting parties mutually consent that those ships of their respective navies which shall be provided with special instructions for that purpose, as hereinafter mentioned, may visit such merchant vessels of the two nations as may, upon reasonable grounds, be suspected of being engaged in the African slave trade, or of having been fitted out for that purpose ; or of having, during the voyage on which they are met by the said cruisers, been engaged in the African slave trade, contrary to the provisions of this treaty; and that such cruisers may detain, and send or carry away, such vessels, in order that they may be brought to trial in the manner hereinafter agreed upon.
In order to fix the reciprocal right of search in such a manner as shall be adapted to the attainment of the object of this treaty, and at the same time avoid doubts, disputes, and complaints, the said right of search shall be understood in the manner and according to the rules following:
First. It shall never be exercised except by vessels of war, authorized
expressly for that object, according to the stipulations of this treaty. Secondly. The right of search shall in no case be exercised with re-
spect to a vessel of the ravy of either of the two Powers, but shall be exercised only as regards merchant-vessels; and it shall not be exercised by a vessel of war of either contracting party within the limits

Mode of search Thirdly. Whenever a merchant-vessel is searched by a ship of war,

the commander of the merchant-vessel the special instructions by which

he is duly authorized to search ; and shall deliver to such commander a

certificate, signed by himself, stating his rank in the naval service of his

country, and the name of the vessel he commands, and also declaring that

the only object of the search is to ascertain whether the vessel is em-

ployed in the African slave trade, or is fitted up for the said trade.

When the search is made by an officer of the cruiser who is not the com-

mander, such officer shall exhibit to the captain of the merchant-vessel a

copy of the before-mentioned special instructions, signed by the com-

mander of the cruiser; and he shall in like manner deliver a certificate

signed by himself, stating his rank in the navy, the name of the com-

mander by whose orders he proceeds to make the search, that of the

cruiser in which he sails, and the object of the search, as above described.

If it appears from the search that the papers of the vessel are in regular

order, and that it is employed on lawful objects, the officer shall enter in

the log-book of the vessel that the search has been made in pursuance of

the aforesaid special instructions ; and the vessel shall be left at liberty to

pursue its voyage. The rank of the officer who makes the search must

not be less than that of lieutenant in the navy, unless the command, either

by reason of death or other cause, is at the time held by an officer of

inferior rank. Fourthly. The reciprocal right of search and detention shall be exer-
cised only within the distance of two hundred miles from the coast of Africa, and to the southward of the thirty-second parallel of north lati-

tude, and within thirty leagues from the coast of the Island of Cuba.

Art ic le II. In order to regulate the mode of carrying the provisions

of the preceding article into execution, it is agreed -- Ships of war tc' First. That all the ships of the navies of the two nations which shall

porary absence, be sufficient to authorize the officer on whom the command

of the vessel has devolved to make the search, although such officer may

not hold the aforesaid rank in the service.

suspicions to the commander of the convoy, who, accompanied by the

commander of the cruiser, shall proceed to the search of the suspected

vessel; and in case the suspicions appear well founded, according to the

tenor of this treaty, then the said vessel shall be conducted or sent to one

of the places where the mixed courts of justice are stationed, in order

that it may there be adjudicated upon.

TREATY WITH GREAT BRITAIN. Apri l 7, 1862.

1227

Fourthly. It is further mutually agreed that the commanders of the ships of the two navies, respectively, who shall be employed on this service, shall adhere strictly to the exact tenor of the aforesaid instructions.
Art ic le III. As the two preceding articles are entirely reciprocal, the two high contracting parties engage mutually to make good any losses which their respective subjects or citizens may incur by an arbitrary and illegal detention of their vessels ; it being understood that this indemnity shall be borne by the Government whose cruiser shall have been guilty of such arbitrary and illegal detention ; and that the search and detention of vessels specified in the first article of this treaty shall be effected only by ships which may form part of the two navies, respectively, and by such of those ships only as are provided with the special instructions annexed to the present treaty, in pursuance of the provisions thereof. The indemnification for the damages of which this article treats shall be paid within the term of one year, reckoning from the day in which the mixed court of justice pronounces its sentence.
Art ic le IV. In order to bring to adjudication with as little delay and inconvenience as possible, the vessels which may be detained according to the tenor of the first article of this treaty, there shall be established, as soon as may be practicable, three mixed courts of justice, formed by an equal number of individuals of the two nations, named for this purpose by their respective Governments. These courts shall reside, one at Sierra Leone, one at the Cape of Good Hope, and one at New York.
But each of the two high contracting parties reserves to itself the right
of changing, at its pleasure, the place of residence of the court or courts held within its own territories.
These courts shall judge the causes submitted to them according to the provisions of the present treaty, and according to the regulations and instructions which are annexed to the present treaty, and which are considered an integral part thereof; and there shall be no appeal from their decision.
Art ic le V. In case the commanding officer of any of the ships of the navies of either country, duly commissioned according to the provisions of the first article of this treaty, shall deviate in any respect from the stipulations of the said treaty, or from the instructions annexed to it, the Government which shall conceive itself to be wronged thereby shall be entitled to demand reparation ; and in such case the Government to which such commanding officer may belong binds itself to cause inquiry to be made into the subject of the complaint, and to inflict upon the said officer a punishment proportioned to any wilful transgression which he may be proved to have committed.
Art ic le VI. It is hereby further mutually agreed, that every American or British merchant-vessel which shall be searched by virtue of the present treaty may lawfully be detained, and sent or brought before the mixed courts of justice established in pursuance of the provisions thereof, if, in her equipment, there shall be found any of the things hereinafter mentioned, namely:
First. Hatches with open gratings, instead of the close hatches, which are usual in- merchant vessels.
Second. Divisions or bulk-heads in the hold or on deck, in greater number than are necessary for vessels engaged in lawful trade.
Third. Spare plank fitted for laying down as a second or slave deck. Fourth. Shackles, bolts, or handcuffs. Fifth- A larger quantity of water in casks or in tanks than is requisite for the consumption of the crew of the vessel as a merchant-vessel. Sixth. An extraordinary number of water casks, or of other vessels for holding liquid; unless the master shall produce a certificate from the custom-house at the place from which he cleared outwards, stating that a sufficient security had been given by the owners of such vessel that vo l . xti.

brought before that one of the two mixed courts of justice to be established at the Cape of Good Hope and at Sierra Leone, which may be nearest to the place of detention, or which the captor, on his own responsibility, may think can be soonest reached from such place.
If the vessel shall be detained on the coast of the Island of Cuba, she shall be brought before the mixed court of justice at New York.
Art ic le II. Whenever a ship of either of the two navies, duly authorized as aforesaid, shall meet a merchant-vessel liable to be searched under the provisions of the said treaty, the search shall be conducted with the courtesy and consideration which ought to be observed between allied and friendly nations; and the search shall, in all cases, be made by an officer holding a rank not lower than that of a lieutenant in the navy; or by the officer who at the time shall be second in command of the ship by which such search is made.
Art ic le III. The commander of any ship of the two navies, duly authorized as aforesaid, who may detain any merchant-vessel, in pursuance of the tenor of the present instructions, shall leave on board the vessel so detained, the master, the mate or boatswain, and two or three, at least, of the crew, the whole of the negroes, if any, and all the cargo. The captor shall, at the time of detention, draw up, in writing, a declaration', which shall exhibit the state in which he found the detained vessel; such declaration shall be signed by himself, and shall be given in or sent, together with the captured vessel, to the mixed court of justice before which such vessel shall be carried or sent for adjudication. He shall deliver to the master of the detained vessel a signed and certified list of the
papers found on board the same, as well as a certificate of the number of negroes found on board at the moment of detention.
In the declaration which the captor is hereby required to make, as well as in the certified list of the papers seized, and in the certificate of the number of negroes found on board the detained vessel, he shall insert his own name and surname, the name of the capturing ship, and the latitude and longitude of the place where the detention shall have been made.
The officer in charge of the detained vessel shall, at the time of bringing the vessel's papers into the mixed court of justice, deliver into the court a certificate signed by himself, and verified on oath, stating any changes which may have taken place in respect to the vessel, her crew, the negroes if any, and her cargo, between the period of her detention and the time of delivering in such paper.
Arti cle IV. If urgent reasons, arising from the length of the voyage the state of health of the negroes, or any other cause, should require that either the whole or a portion of such negroes should be disembarked before the vessel can arrive at the place at which one of the mixed courts of justice is established, the commander of the capturing ship may take upon himself the responsibility of so disembarking the negroes, provided the necessity of the disembarkation, and the causes thereof, be stated in a certificate in proper form. Such certificate shall be drawn up and entered at the time on the log-book of the detained vessel.
Art ic le V. In case any merchant-vegsel, detained in pursuance of the present instructions, should prove to be unseaworthy, or in such a condition as not to be taken to one of the three ports where the mixed courts of justice are to be established in pursuance of the treaty of this date, the commander of the detaining cruiser may take upon hirrf^elf the responsibility of abandoning or destroying her, provided the exact causes which made such a step imperatively necessary be stated in a certificate verified on oath. Such certificate shall be drawn up and formally executed in duplicate at the time.
In case of the abandonment or destruction of a detained vessel, the master and crew, together with the negroes and papers found on board,
and one copy of the sworn certificate mentioned in the preceding para-

And whereas the same is producing some excitement and misunderstanding, therefore,
I, ABRAHAM LINCOLN, President of the United States, proclaim and declare, that the Government of the United States had no knowledge, information, or belief, of an intention on the part of General Hunter to issue such a proclamation; nor has it yet any authentic information that the document is genuine. And further, that neither General Hunter, nor any other commander, or person, has been authorized by the Government of the United States to make proclamations declaring the slaves of any State free; and that the supposed proclamation, now in question, whether genuine or false, is altogether void, so far as respects such declaration.
I further make known that whether it be competent for me, as Commanderin-Chief of the Army and Navy, to declare the slaves of any State or States free, and whether, at any time, in any case, it shall have become a necessity indispensable to the maintenance of the Government, to exercise such supposed power, are questions which, under my responsibility, I reserve to myself, and which I cannot feel justified in leaving to the decision of commanders in the field. These are totally different questions from those of police regulations in armies and camps.
On the sixth day of March last, by a special message, I recommended to Congress the adoption of a joint resolution to be substantially as follows:

Proclamation void in part.
Appeal for the gradual abolishment of slavery.

Resolved, That the United States ought to cooperate with any State which may adopt a gradual abolishment of slavery, giving to such State pecuniary aid, to be used by such State in its discretion, to compensate for the inconveniences, public and private, produced by such change of system.

The resolution, in the language above quoted, was adopted by large majorities in both branches of Congress, and now stands an authentic, definite, and solemn proposal of the nation to the States and people most immediately interested in the subject matter. To the people of those States I now earnestly appeal -- I do not argue -- I beseech you to make the arguments for yourselves -- You cannot, if you would, be blind to the signs of the times -- I beg of you a calm and enlarged consideration of them, ranging, if it may be, far above personal and partisan politics. This proposal makes common cause for a common object, casting no reproaches upon any. It acts not the Pharisee. The change it contemplates would come gently as the dews of heaven, not rending or wrecking anything. Will you not embrace it? So much good has not been done, by one effort, in all past time, as, in the providence of God, it is now your high privilege to do. May the vast future not have to lament that you have neglected it.
In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.

Transit duty to be reduced.
Frauds may be prevented.

The Sublime Porte, desiring to grant, by means of gradual concessions, all facilities in its power to transit by land, it is stipulated and agreed that the duty of three per cent., levied up to this time on articles imported into the Ottoman Empire, in their passage through the Ottoman Empire to other countries, shall be reduced to two per cent., payable as the duty of three per cent, has been paid hitherto, on arriving in the Ottoman dominions ; and at the end of eight years, to be reckoned from the day of the exchange of the ratifications of the present treaty, to a fixed and definite tax of one per cent., which shall be levied, as is to be the case with respect to Ottoman produce exported, to defray the expense of registration.
The Sublime Porte, at the same time, declares that it reserves to itself the right to establish, by a special enactment, the measures to be adopted for the prevention of fraud.

La Sublime Porte desirant accorder, au moyen de -concessions graduelles, toutes les facilites en son pouvoir au Transit par terre, il a ete stipule et convenu que le Droit de trois pour cent, prelve jusqu' a ce jour sur les marchandises importees dans 1'Empire Ottoman pour en etre expedites dans d'autres pays, sera reduit a Deux pour cent., payable (comme le droit de Trois pour cent, a ete paye jusqu'ici) a leur arrive e dans les Etats Ottomans, et au bout de huit-ans, a compter du jour oil les Ratifications du present Traite auront ete echangees, a une taxe fixe, et definie, d'un pour cent., qui sera preleve (comme ce sera egalement le-cas pour 1'exportation des produits Ottomans) pour couvrir les frais d'enregistrement.

July 4,1862. Regulations under the Treaty, and Rates of Postage between the United States and Mexico.

Pos t -Offic e Depar tmen t , July 4, 1862.

By the recent postal convention with Mexico, proclaimed by the Presi-

dent on the 20th of June, 1862, the following rates of postage are

established, of which postmasters will take notice : --

Rates of post- 1st. The single letter rate (inland three cents and sea seven cents) is

age.

ten cents per half-ounce; and for each fraction over, an additional rate;

and prepayment is required. This applies to all letters sent to Mexico

from the United States by sea.

2d. On all letters received from Mexico by sea the United States

domestic rate of postage is to be charged, rating them at the first United

States post-office at which they are mailed to their destination, either three

or ten cents per single rate. This is to be collected on delivery.

3d. On all letters sent to or received from Mexico, when not conveyed

by sea, the United States domestic postage only, of three or ten cents the

single rate, is to be charged. This must be prepaid at the mailing office

on letters sent, and collected at the office of delivery on letters received.

4th. The sea rate on printed matter sent to Mexico is one cent for each

newspaper and one cent per ounce (or fraction of an ounce) on all maga-

zines, periodical publications, and other printed matter; and this is to be

added, when sent by sea, to our usual inland rate of postage; and this

combined rate must be prepaid at the mailing-office in the United States.

When sent by land the United States inland rate of postage only is to be

charged and prepaid at the mailing office.

5th. On all such printed matter received from Mexico only our usual

inland postage is be collected, and this must be paid in all cases on deliv-

ery at the office of address.

6th. These regulations must be strictly observed, as no accounts are

kept with the Mexican Postal Department.
