Death of Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

To the People of the United States : It has pleased God in His infinite wisdom to take from us the im-
mortal spirit of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the 32nd President of the United States.

The leader of his people in a great war, he lived to see the assurance of the victory but not to share it. He lived to see the first foundations of the free and peaceful world to which his life was dedicated , but not to enter on that world himself.

His fellow countrymen will sorely miss his fortitude and faith and courage in the time to come.

The peoples of the earth who love the ways of freedom and of hope will mourn for him.

But though his voice is silent , his courage is not spent, his faith is

not extinguished. The courage of great men outlives them to become the courage of their people and the peoples of the world . It lives

beyond them and upholds their purposes and brings their hopes to
pass . Now, therefore, I, Harry S. Truman, President of the United Day of mourning and prayer, April 14,
States of America, do appoint Saturday next, April 14th, the day of 1945.
the funeral service for the dead President, as a day of mourning and prayer throughout the United States . I earnestly recommend
the people to assemble on that day in their respective places of divine worship, there to bow down in submission to the will of Almighty God, and to pay out of full hearts their homage of love and reverence to the memory of the great and good man whose death they mourn.

NATIONAL REHABILITATION WEEK BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
A PROCLAMATION

With the attention of the Nation rightly focused on the welfare of men and women returning from service in the armed forces and the

emphasis placed on benefits provided for them through Congressional

action, we must not let our interest flag in discharging our obligations to the increasing thousands among our civilian population who through accident, disease, or congenital conditions are unable to hold a place in the ranks of the American working force. Even in the midst of war their condition calls to us for renewed effort to bring about their

41 Stat. 735. 29 U.S.C.. §§ 31-38, 41-44. 57 Stat. 374.

restoration that they , too , may maintain their self-respect through self-supporting work.
On June 2 , our Nation-wide program for the vocational rehabilitation of such disabled men and women will have been in operation a quarter of a century. Less than two years ago, the Congress expanded this program by amending the Vocational Rehabilitation Act
of 1920. The new law-the Barden-LaFollette Act, passed in 1943makes it possible for the Federal and State Governments, working as a team, to bring to the mentally disabled and the blind and all other

groups of the disabled , the many services necessary to make them employable, including physical restoration, vocational training and placement in suitable employment .
Over the past twenty-five years it has been demonstrated that this

program for the restoration of disabled men and women is paying dividends, not only in humanitarian terms but in dollars and cents.

Thousands of men and women annually apply to the rehabilitation service for help . Because of disabilities they are able to contribute little to the national income. Many of them are forced to accept public aid. Refitted for work, they begin to pay their own way. No

longer then are they tax consumers ; they are taxpayers .

That we may not fail to discharge our obligation to help every man and woman who needs vocational rehabilitation services in order to

become self-supporting, it appears appropriate at this time that I should urge the able-bodied citizenry of the United States to unite in a concerted effort to bring about wider knowledge and use of the services for physical and mental restoration of the handicapped provided under the Barden-LaFollette Act, which applies to all civilian disabled .
NOW, THEREFORE , I , HARRY S. TRUMAN , President of the United States of America, do hereby declare the week beginning June 2 , 1945 , as National Rehabilitation Week.

And I urge all churches , educational institutions, health and wel-

fare services, civic organizations , chambers of commerce, boards of

trade, industry, labor, public-spirited citizens, and the radio and press throughout the United States to observe National Rehabilita-

tion Week, to the end that handicapped men and women throughout our Nation may be located and advised of the benefits to which they may be entitled.

Surrender by GerThe Allied armies, through sacrifice and devotion and with God's many. help, have wrung from Germany a final and unconditional surrender.
The western world has been freed of the evil forces which for five
years and longer have imprisoned the bodies and broken the lives of

millions upon millions of free-born men. They have violated their churches, destroyed their homes, corrupted their children, and murdered their loved ones . Our Armies of Liberation have restored

freedom to these suffering peoples, whose spirit and will the oppressors could never enslave.

Much remains to be done. The victory won in the West must now be won in the East. The whole world must be cleansed of the evil from which half the world has been freed . United , the peace-loving nations have demonstrated in the West that their arms are stronger by

far than the might of dictators or the tyranny of military cliques that once called us soft and weak. The power of our peoples to defend themselves against all enemies will be proved in the Pacific war as it has been proved in Europe.

For the triumph of spirit and of arms which we have won, and for its promise to peoples everywhere who join us in the love of freedom,

it is fitting that we, as a nation, give thanks to Almighty God , who has strengthened us and given us the victory.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, HARRY S. TRUMAN , President of the
United States of America, do hereby appoint Sunday, May 13 , 1945, to be a day of prayer.

Appointment of Sunday, May 13, 1945, as a day of prayer.

I call upon the people of the United States, whatever their faith , to unite in offering joyful thanks to God for the victory we have won and to pray that He will support us to the end of our present struggle and guide us into the way of peace.

I also call upon my countrymen to dedicate this day of prayer to the memory of those who have given their lives to make possible our victory .

FLAG DAY, 1945 BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

May 28, 1945 [No. 2654]

It is our custom each year to set aside a day on which to render special honor to our Flag.

We celebrate Flag Day this year with a fresh sense of our strength as a nation. Solemnly, we accept the responsibilities placed upon us by our power.
We honor the men and women in the armed services and in the

factories and homes who, with God's help, have given us our victories .

We face the battle ahead with solemn gratitude for the triumphs of the past.

Our Flag has accompanied our fighting men on a hundred battle-

fields . It flies beyond the seas over the friendly lands our arms have freed, and over the hostile countries our arms have conquered. Our Flag will be planted in the heart of the empire of our last remaining enemy .
As we press forward to final victory, we are strengthened with the knowledge that for millions of people in other lands as well as in our own our Flag is a living token of human integrity and freedom.

Let us observe this Flag Day by raising our Flag and beside it the

flags of the United Nations. It is especially fitting that we thus honor our Allies at a time when we are working with them to lay a firm foundation for world peace. Let this display of the flags of the United Nations symbolize our unity with our Allies both upon the battlefields of war and under the skies of peace. Let us again dedicate ourselves and our Republic, under God, to the united cause of peace

and justice and the brotherhood of all men everywhere. NOW, THEREFORE , I, HARRY S. TRUMAN, President of the
United States of America, do hereby designate June 14 , 1945 , as Flag Day, and ask that the people of our nation on that day do especially honor our Flag, and the men and women of the armed services who have served under it, and that they also pay honor to our Allies of the United Nations .

Surrender by Japan. The war lords of Japan and the Japanese armed forces have surrendered . They have surrendered unconditionally. Three months after victory in Europe victory has come in the East. The cruel war of aggression which Japan started eight years ago to spread the forces of evil over the Pacific has resulted in her total defeat. This is the end of the grandiose schemes of the dictators to enslave the peoples of the world , destroy their civilization , and institute a new era of darkness and degradation. This day is a new beginning in the history of freedom on this earth. Our global victory has come from the courage and stamina and spirit of free men and women united in determination to fight. It has come from the massive strength of arms and materials created by peace-loving peoples who knew that unless they won decency in the world would end.
It has come from millions of peaceful citizens all over the world-- turned soldiers almost overnight-who showed a ruthless enemy that they were not afraid to fight and to die, and that they knew how to win .
It has come with the help of God, Who was with us in the early days of adversity and disaster, and Who has now brought us to this glorious day of triumph.
Let us give thanks to Him, and remember that we have now dedicated ourselves to follow in His ways to a lasting and just peace and to a better world. Appointment ofSun- NOW, THEREFORE , I , HARRY S. TRUMAN, President of the dasaya,dAauyguofstpr1ay9,er1.945, United States of America, do hereby appoint Sunday, August 19, 1945 , to be a day of prayer.

I also call upon my countrymen to dedicate this day of prayer to the memory of those who have given their lives to make possible our victory .

that the exercise of jurisdiction over the natural resources of the subsoil and sea bed of the continental shelf by the contiguous nation is reasonable and just, since the effectiveness of measures to utilize or conserve these resources would be contingent upon cooperation and protection from the shore, since the continental shelf may be regarded as an extension of the land-mass of the coastal nation and thus natu-

NOW, THEREFORE , I , HARRY S. TRUMAN , President of the United States of America , do hereby proclaim the following policy of the United States of America with respect to the natural resources of the subsoil and sea bed of the continental shelf.

Having concern for the urgency of conserving and prudently utilizing its natural resources, the Government of the United States regards the natural resources of the subsoil and sea bed of the continental shelf beneath the high seas but contiguous to the coasts of the United States as appertaining to the United States , subject to its jurisdiction and control. In cases where the continental shelf extends to the shores of another State, or is shared with an adjacent State, the boundary shall be determined by the United States and the State concerned in accordance with equitable principles.

POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES WITH RESPECT TO COASTAL FISHERIES IN CERTAIN AREAS OF THE HIGH SEAS

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA A PROCLAMATION

September 28, 1945 [No. 2668]

WHEREAS for some years the Government of the United States of America has viewed with concern the inadequacy of present ar-
rangements for the protection and perpetuation of the fishery resources contiguous to its coasts , and in view of the potentially disturbing effect of this situation, has carefully studied the possibility of improving the jurisdictional basis for conservation measures and international cooperation in this field ; and
WHEREAS such fishery resources have a special importance to coastal communities as a source of livelihood and to the nation as a food and industrial resource ; and

WHEREAS the progressive development of new methods and

techniques contributes to intensified fishing over wide sea areas and

in certain cases seriously threatens fisheries with depletion ; and WHEREAS there is an urgent need to protect coastal fishery

resources from destructive exploitation, having due regard to condi-

tions peculiar to each region and situation and to the special rights

and equities of the coastal State and of any other State which may have established a legitimate interest therein ;
NOW, THEREFORE , I, HARRY S. TRUMAN , President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the following policy

Policy with respect to coastal fisheries.

of the United States of America with respect to coastal fisheries in

certain areas of the high seas :

In view of the pressing need for conservation and protection of

fishery resources, the Government of the United States regards it as

proper to establish conservation zones in those areas of the high seas

contiguous to the coasts of the United States wherein fishing activities

have been or in the future may be developed and maintained on a substantial scale . Where such activities have been or shall hereafter

be developed and maintained by its nationals alone, the United States regards it as proper to establish explicitly bounded conservation zones in which fishing activities shall be subject to the regulation and control of the United States . Where such activities have been or shall here-

after be legitimately developed and maintained jointly by nationals of the United States and nationals of other States, explicitly bounded conservation zones may be established under agreements between the United States and such other States ; and all fishing activities in such

886

zones shall be subject to regulation and control as provided in such agreements . The right of any State to establish conservation zones off its shores in accordance with the above principles is conceded , provided that corresponding recognition is given to any fishing interests of nationals of the United States which may exist in such areas . The character as high seas of the areas in which such conservation zones are established and the right to their free and unimpeded navigation are in no way thus affected.

PROCLAMATIONS- Nov. 12 , 1945 Dec. 7, 1945

on this day of our abundance, strength, and achievement ; let us give thanks to Almighty Providence for these exceeding blessings .
We have won them with the courage and the blood of our soldiers, sailors, and airmen . We have won them by the sweat and ingenuity of our workers , farmers , engineers , and industrialists . We have won them with the devotion of our women and children . We have bought them with the treasure of our rich land . But above all we have won

them because we cherish freedom beyond riches and even more than life itself.

We give thanks with the humility of free men, each knowing it was the might of no one arm but of all together by which we were saved.
Liberty knows no race, creed, or class in our country or in the world. In unity we found our first weapon, for without it, both here and abroad, we were doomed . None have known this better than our
very gallant dead , none better than their comrade , Franklin Delano
Roosevelt. Our thanksgiving has the humility of our deep mourning for them, our vast gratitude to them.
Triumph over the enemy has not dispelled every difficulty. Many vital and far-reaching decisions await us as we strive for a just and enduring peace . We will not fail if we preserve , in our own land and throughout the world, that same devotion to the essential freedoms
and rights of mankind which sustained us throughout the war and brought us final victory.

[59 STAT.

Considering that the present situation of the sugar market renders it both possible and necessary for the Governments concerned to collaborate to this end;
Bearing in mind the principle laid down by the above-mentioned Conference that any international agreement for the regulation of production and marketing should be equitable both to producers and consumers ;
Have agreed as follows :-
Chapter I.-Definitions.
ARTICLE 1 .
For the purposes of the present Agreement-
(1) " Ton" means a metric ton of 1,000 kilograms . "Long ton" means a ton of 2,240 lbs . avoirdupois. "Short ton" means a ton of 2,000 lbs. avoirdupois.
(2) "Quota year" means the period from the 1st September to the 31st August.
(3) " Sugar" shall be deemed to include sugar in any of its commercial forms , except the product sold as final molasses , and also except the so-called " Goela Mangkok" sugar produced by primitive methods by natives of Java for their own account to which sugar the Government of the Netherlands East Indies does not extend its legislative measures .
The sugar equivalent of exports of the product known as "fancy molasses" from Barbados shall, however, be charged to the export quota of the British Colonial Empire.
The respective export quotas of sugar referred to in this Agreement shall, in the case of cane sugar producing countries, mean and refer to the nature and the types of sugar heretofore exported by such countries ; and, in the case of beet sugar producing countries , shall mean raw sugar tel quel, white sugars of the latter countries to be converted to a raw basis at the rate of nine parts white to ten parts raw. Such quantities shall, in all cases, mean net weight excluding the container.
(4) "Net imports" means total imports after deducting total exports .
(5) " Net exports" means total exports after deducting total imports.
(6) " Exports to the free market" shall include all net exports from the countries to which export quotas for the free market are or may be allotted under Article 19 , with the exception of-
(a) exports from the Republic of Cuba to the United States of America under any import quota allotted by the United States of America to Cuba ; provided that such sugar is not re-exported from the United States of America to any country except Cuba, and further provided that any sugar exported from Cuba to the United States of America under a quota allotted under paragraph (a) of Article 9 shall be included in the exports of Cuba to the free market ;

59 STAT. ] MULTILATERAL- SUGAR-- July 22, May 6, 1937 1942 ; Aug. 31 , 1944

Chapter II. -General Undertakings.

ARTICLE 2 .
The Contracting Governments agree that it is their policy so to direct the arrangements made under the present Agreement as always to assure consumers of an adequate supply of sugar on the world market at a reasonable price not to exceed the cost of production, including a reasonable profit, of efficient producers.
ARTICLE 3.
The Contracting Governments shall take all the legislative or administrative measures necessary for the execution of the present Agreement. The texts of such measures shall be communicated to the Secretariat of the Council .

Policy. Execution.

ARTICLE 4 .
Avoidance of excesWhile recognising that all Government measures relating to sive production. agrarian policy and to state assistance to the sugar industry are governed by the internal conditions of each country and in many
cases require the approval of Parliament, the Contracting Governments agree that it is desirable that-

(a) If and when prices on the free market rise, all necessary steps should be taken to prevent the rise in world prices from leading on the one hand to an increase of internal prices for consumers such as would be likely to check consumption, and on the other hand to a rise of wholesale prices (beyond the level required to secure a fair return for growers and producers) to such a point as to stimulate excess production not justified by the requirements of the market, thus defeating the object of the present Agreement ;
(b) In sugar exporting countries whose internal prices are not directly affected by a rise in the world price of sugar, all necessary steps should be taken to prevent the increase in the returns received from sugar production for export from causing the same difficulty by stimulating excessive and unjustified production.

tion.

favourable consideration should be given to all proposals having for

their object :-

For this purpose export quotas shall be deemed to be the basic quotas after deducting any part of such quotas released under Article 24 (a) or adding any special allocations made under Article 24 (b) for the years in question.
(b) In subsequent years, it shall be open to the Council to recommend at any time whether, and to what extent, a reduction would be desirable, but such reduction shall come into force only if all the members of the Council representing countries entitled to basic quotas or to participation in the reserve, consent to it.

ARTICLE 22.

Adherence to quotas.

Each Contracting Government to which an export quota has been

or may be allotted undertakes to ensure that net exports from its

territories to the free market for any given quota year shall not

exceed the export quota in force for it in that year under the provisions

of the present Agreement. ARTICLE 23 .

Deficiency in quota. If in any year of the Agreement a Contracting Government should

not export its quota or any part of it, it shall not thereby acquire any right to an increase of its quota in the following year.

Nevertheless, if the Government of Czechoslovakia proves to the satisfaction of the Executive Committee that, owing to a low or high

water level or the presence of ice on the Elbe, Czechoslovakia has

been unable to export her full quota in any quota year, the Czecho-

slovak Government may be permitted to export the deficiency during

the first three months of the next quota year, in addition to her

quota for that year.

ARTICLE 24 .

Redistribution.

(a) Each Contracting Government shall notify the Council, as soon as possible, if it does not propose to make use of its export quota, or any part of it, in any quota year, so that the quantities which will

not be used may be redistributed (i) among the other Contracting

Governments which notify the Council that they are in a position to

use them and (ii) to the reserve quota. Subject to paragraph (b)

below, this redistribution shall be made pro rata according to the

basic quotas.

Cases of special

hardship .

(b) The Council shall in any given quota year have power to use

up to 25 per cent. of the quotas available for redistribution or up to

50,000 metric tons of such quotas, whichever shall be the larger

amount , to meet proved cases of special hardship . Nevertheless , if in a particular year the amount available for redistribution should be

less than 30,000 tons, the Council shall have power, should a proved case of special hardship arise, to allot to meet the necessities of that

case an amount up to 30,000 tons . The excess of this amount over the amount available for redistribution shall constitute an increase of

the supplies to the free market and the quotas of other Contracting Governments shall not be affected.

(c) The Governments of the following countries have given notice

that during the quota year beginning on the 1st September, 1937 ,

they will not make use of the parts of their export quotas herein indicated :--

Neither the basic quotas nor the export quotas for a particular year nor any additional quotas may be ceded by one Contracting Government to another.

Chapter V. - Stocks. ARTICLE 26.

(a) While the Contracting Governments fully realise that due regard must be had to the necessity of maintaining adequate reserve supplies to meet unexpected demands, they agree that it is undesirable that excessive stocks of sugar which would weigh on the market should be accumulated in their respective countries.
(b) Those Contracting Governments to which export quotas have been or may be allotted under the present Agreement, undertake so to regulate their production that the stocks in their respective countries shall not exceed, for each country, on a fixed date in each year to be agreed with the Council, an amount equal to 25 per cent. of its annual production .
(c) Nevertheless , the Council may if it considers that such action is justified by special circumstances allot to any country a stock in excess of 25 per cent. of its production .
(d) On account of its special situation in connection with exports to the United States and the requirements of Contract No. 4 on the New York Sugar Exchange, the Republic of Cuba may have at the end of each calendar year as stocks ( 1 ) for the United States an amount not to exceed 30 per cent. of its export quota to that country, (2) for the free market, an amount not to exceed 300,000 metric tons, provided that a system of control is maintained by the Government of the Republic of Cuba, by means of identity certificates or otherwise, which ensures that such stocks are used for those purposes .
(e) Having regard to the special conditions of production in the Netherlands East Indies, that territory shall be permitted to have a stock not exceeding 500,000 tons on the 1st April in each year.
Hungary shall be permitted to have a stock of 30 per cent. of its annual production .
ARTICLE 27.
Those Contracting Governments to which free market export quotas have been allotted agree in respect of their cane producing territories to regulate sugar production in those territories, unless prevented from doing so by drought, flood or other adverse conditions , so that stocks shall equal, on a fixed date in each year to be agreed with the Council, an amount not less than 10 per cent . of their respective export quotas for such year, provided nothing in this Article shall be construed as requiring any country to produce in excess of its basic export quota specified in Article 19 during either of the years 1937-38 or 1938-39 .

PROTOCOL ANNEXED TO THE AGREEMENT.

1. At the moment of signing the Agreement regarding the Regulation of the Production and Marketing of Sugar of to -day's date, the signatory Governments agree that the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland shall take between this date and the assumption of its duties by the Provisional Council referred to below any steps necessary as transitional measures , including the convening of the first session of the said Provisional Council, which shall be held in London as soon as possible , the preparation of the agenda for that session , and the making of all necessary arrangements.
2. The said Governments agree to appoint, as soon as possible, representatives who shall constitute a Provisional Council, which shall exercise all the functions of the International Sugar Council to be set up under that Agreement, and which shall be subject in all respects to the provisions of Chapter VI of the said Agreement, provided that no decisions of such a Provisional Council shall be binding on the signatory Governments prior to the coming into force of the Agreement .

September, 1937, the signatory Governments agree to accept pro-

visionally as equivalent to ratification for the purposes of bringing

the Agreement into force on that date a declaration by that Govern-

ment that it will provisionally accept the obligations of the Agreement

as from that date and will ratify it as soon as possible. Should the

ratification of such Government not be deposited before the 1st Janu-

ary, 1938 , the Contracting Governments shall have the right to decide

whether or not the Agreement is to be maintained in force.

5. Each signatory Government undertakes to ensure that so far

as its territories are concerned the situation as regards production,

export and import of sugar shall not be modified in a manner contrary

to the aims of the Agreement during the period between the date of

its signature and the date of entry into force of the Agreement. Any

Position of Canadian Government.

infringement of this undertaking shall be equivalent to a violation of the Agreement.
6. The signatory Governments take note of the following declaration, which was made to the Conference by the delegate of the Government of Canada :-

"I desire to make a brief statement regarding the position of the Government of Canada. After an examination of the Convention ,

necessarily hurried , the Government of Canada regret that they have not found it possible to authorise signature at the present time. They are, of course, sympathetic with the aim of the Conference of averting uneconomic production , but the position of Canada at this Conference as an importer and consumer of sugar is so different from that of almost all the other countries represented that they desire a further period of time to study the effect of the specific proposals of the Convention on that position ; and in the light of that study to decide whether it would be possible to accede later . At the same time, the Government of Canada reiterate the assurance already given that they do not propose to stimulate the production of sugar in Canada during the term of this agreement by subsidy, increased protection , special remission of taxes , or by any other similar measures. "

ACTION EN CAS DE MENACE CONTRE LE PAIX, DE RUPTURE DE LA PAIX ET D'ACTE D'AGRESSION
Article 39 Le Conseil de Sécurité constate l'existence d'une menace contre la paix, d'une rupture de la paix ou d'un acte d'agression et fait des recommandations ou décide quelles mesures seront

prises conformément aux articles 41 et 42 pour maintenir ou rétablir la paix et la sécurité internationales.
Article 40
Afin d'empêcher la situation de s'aggraver, le Conseil de Sécurité, avant de faire les recommandations ou de décider des mesures à prendre conformément à l'article 39, peut inviter les parties intéressées à se conformer aux mesures provisoires qu'il juge nécessaires ou souhaitables. Ces mesures provisoires ne préjugent en rien les droits, les prétentions ou la position des parties intéressées. En cas de non execution de ces mesures provisoires, le Conseil de Sécurité tient dûment compte de cette défaillance.
Article 41
Le Conseil de Sécurité peut décider quelles mesures n'impliquant pas l'emploi de la force armée doivent être prises pour donner effet à ses décisions, et peut inviter les Membres des Nations Unies à appliquer ces mesures. Celles-ci peuvent comprendre l'interruption complète ou partielle des relations économiques et des communications ferroviaires, maritimes, aériennes, postales, télégraphiques, radio-électriques et des autres moyens de communication, ainsi que la rupture des relations diplomatiques.
Article 42
Si le Conseil de Sécurité estime que les mesures prevues à l'article 41 seraient inadéquates ou qu'elles se sont révélées telles, il peut entreprendre, au moyen de forces aériennes, navales ou terrestres, toute action qu'il juge nécessaire au maintien ou au rétablissement de la paix et de la sécurité internationales. Cette action peut com. prendre des démonstrations, des mesures de blocus et d'autres opérations exécutées par des forces aériennes, navales ou terrestres de Membres des Nations Unies.

Aucune disposition de la présente Charte ne porte atteinte au droit naturel de légitime défense, individuelle ou collective, dans le cas où un Membre des Nations Unies est l'objet d'une agression armée, jusqu'à ce que le Conseil de Sécurité ait pris les mesures nécessaires pour maintenir la paix et la sécurité internationales. Les mesures prises par des Membres dans l'exercice de ce droit de légitime défense sont immédiatement portées à la connaissance du Conseil de Sécurité et n'affectent en rien le pouvoir et le devoir qu'a le Conseil , en vertu de la présente Charte, d'agir à tout mo ment de la manière qu'il juge nécessaire pour maintenir ou rétablir la paix et la sécurité internationales.

CAPITULO I
PROPOSITOS Y PRINCIPIOS
Artículo 1 Los Propósitos de las Naciones Unidas son : 1. Mantener la paz y la seguridad internacionales, y con tal fin : tomar medidas colectivas eficaces para prevenir y eliminar amenazas a la paz, y para suprimir actos de agresión u otros quebrantamientos de la paz ; y lograr por medios pacíficos, y de conformidad con los principios de la justicia y del derecho internacional, el ajuste o arreglo de controversias o situaciones internacionales susceptibles de conducir a quebrantamientos de la paz; 2. Fomentar entre las naciones relaciones de amistad basadas en el respeto al principio de la igualdad de derechos y al de la libre determinación de los pueblos, y tomar otras medidas adecuadas para fortalecer la paz universal ; 3. Realizar la cooperación internacional en la solución de problemas internacionales de carácter económico, social, cultural o humanitario, y en el desarrollo y estímulo del respeto a los derechos humanos y a las libertades fundamentales de todos, sin hacer distinción por motivos de raza, sexo, idioma o religión ; y 4. Servir de centro que armonice los esfuerzos de las naciones por alcanzar estos propósitos comunes.
Artículo 2
Para la realización de los Propósitos consignados en el Artículo 1 , la Organización y sus Miembros procederán de acuerdo con los siguientes Principios :
1. La Organización está basada en el principio de la igualdad soberana de todos sus Miembros.

6. La Organización hará que los Estados que no son Miembros de las Naciones Unidas se conduzcan de acuerdo con estos Principios en la medida que sea necesaria para mantener la paz y la seguridad internacionales.
7. Ninguna disposición de esta Carta autorizará a las Naciones Unidas a intervenir en los asuntos que son esencialmente de la jurisdicción interna de los Estados, ni obligará a los Miembros a someter dichos asuntos a procedimientos de arreglo conforme a la presente Carta ; pero este principio no se opone a la aplicación de las medidas coercitivas prescritas en el Capítulo VII.

I have the honor to refer to Your Excellency's courteous Note of

July 15, 1944 (No. 9175) in which Your Excellency was so good as to indicate the desire of the Government of Guatemala to enter into a

cooperative educational program to be undertaken jointly between the Government of Guatemala and an Agency of the Government of the United States in the Republic of Guatemala.
The Government of the United States of America is prepared to assist the Government of Guatemala with such a program by contributing the sum of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($ 100,000) with the understanding that the Republic of Guatemala will contribute Fifty Thousand Quetzales (Q50,000) for the same program . The assistance of the Government of the United States of America will be

rendered through its agency, the Inter-American Educational Foundation, Incorporated , a corporation of the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs, to which it is hoped Your Excellency's Government would extend all the rights and privileges in Guatemala to which the Foundation would be entitled as an agency of the United States Government or which would facilitate its part in the cooperative educational program.

It is my understanding that the Government of Guatemala would be disposed to include among those rights and privileges the entry, free of customs duties and other taxes and charges, of the official supplies and equipment for the Inter-American Educational Foundation, Incorporated, as well as the personal effects and supplies of the employees of the Foundation who are citizens of the United States receiving compensation from any Government ; and that the Foundation would be accorded every feasible facility of free communication and transportation within the limits of Guatemala and that it and its employees would be free of internal taxation.

Agreement between the United States of America and Panama respecting general relations. Effected by exchange of notes signed at Washington May 18, 1942.

May 18, 1942 [E. A. S. 452]

The Secretary of State to the Panamanian Ambassador

EXCELLENCY :

DEPARTMENT OF STATE WASHINGTON May 18, 1942

I have the honor to refer to the memorandum which the Ambassador

of Panama left with the President of the United States on February

18, 1941 [1] and to the Department's memoranda of July 8, July 18 , and December 2, 1941 [ ¹ ] in reply thereto, regarding twelve points in the relations between Panama and the United States with respect to which

positive action by this Government was requested .

Subsequent negotiations have happily led to agreement between

our two Governments on all these points, I understand , in the form

set forth below :

1

1. The Waterworks at Colón and Panamá.

When the authority of the Congress of the United States shall have been obtained therefor, the Government of the United States will transfer to the Government of the Republic of Panama free of cost all of its rights, title and interest in the system of sewers and waterworks in the cities of Panamá and Colón.

At that time the United States will renounce the right which it obtained in the first paragraph of Article VII of the Convention between the United States and the Republic of Panama signed at Washington, November 18, 1903, as modified by Article VI of the Treaty between the United States and Panama signed at Washington March 2, 1936, to acquire lands, buildings, water rights or other properties necessary for purposes of sanitation such as the collectio.n or disposal of sewage and the distribution of water in the cities of

Panamá and Colón. The United States, likewise, will renounce the authority contained in Article VII of the above-mentioned convention of 1903 to impose and collect water rates and sewerage rates in those cities which shall be sufficient to provide for the payment of

interest and amortization of the principal of the cost of said works. It is understood that there will be no refund to Panama of amortiza-

tion and interest payments or charges of any kind based on the Convention of 1903 and on the contracts of September 30, 1910.
If the Panamanian Government so desires, the cities of Panamá and Colón may continue to receive supplies of water from the Canal Zone

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [ 59 STAT.
at the outlets now provided at the Canal Zone boundary at a reasonable rate to be agreed upon by both Governments.
Likewise, if the Panamanian Government so desires, the cities of Panamá and Colón may continue to use, to the extent prevailing at present and with the facilities now available, the sewage disposal services of the Canal Zone. The water rate to be agreed upon will include the cost of these services.
If at any time the Government of the Republic of Panama should desire to renounce the use in part of the water supply and sewerage facilities of the Canal Zone referred to above, the two Governments would agree upon the charges payable by the Republic of Panama for the use of such facilities as it may desire to retain.
It is understood that employees of the Panama Canal and the Panama Railroad Company residing in the Republic of Panama shall not be charged higher water rates than those charged other residents of Panamá and Colón , respectively, for similar services.
It should be pointed out that the turning over to the Government of the Republic of Panama of the physical properties of the water works and sewerage systems and the administration thereof, including the collection of the water rates does not in any way modify the existing arrangement for the responsibility of the public health services of the cities of Panamá and Colón as specified in the second paragraph of Article VII of the Convention between the United States of America and Panama, signed at Washington , November 18, 1903. Thus, the Republic of Panama will continue to pay only those costs of sanitary measures for which it has been responsible in the past.
This Government in continuing to maintain the health services in the cities of Panamá and Colón is confident that the Government of the Republic of Panama will fully cooperate with the appropriate Canal Zone officials in carrying out the agreement regarding increased participation of Panamanian personnel in sanitation activities in those cities as set forth in the exchange of notes accompanying the General Treaty of March 2 , 1936, which in turn refer to the earlier proposal of October 1931.
2. Railroad Lots in Panamá and Colón. The President will seek the authority of the Congress of the United States to transfer to the Republic of Panama free of cost all of its rights, title and interest to the lands belonging to or of which the Panama Railroad Company now has usufruct in the cities of Panamá and Colón which are not currently or prospectively needed for the maintenance, operation, sanitation and protection of the Panama Canal, or of its auxiliary works , or for the operation of the Panama railroad. The Panama Railroad Company will convey to the Republic of Panama those lands which it possesses within that portion of Manzanillo Island lying within the area bounded by a line described as follows : ( See copy of map M 5036-3 transmitted with the Department's memorandum of July 8, 1941.)

3. The commissaries and post exchanges. The Government of the United States and the Government of the Republic of Panama, in accordance with the exchange of notes accompanying the Treaty between them signed at Washington on March 2 , 1936, "will continue to cooperate in all proper ways .. to prevent smuggling into territory under the jurisdiction of the Republic of goods imported into the Canal Zone" and for that purpose it is agreed that the Governor of the Panama Canal will appoint a representative to meet with a representative appointed by the Government of the Republic in order that regular and continuing opportunity may be afforded for mutual conference and helpful exchange of views bearing on this question. 4. The construction of a tunnel or bridge to allow transit under or over the Canal at Balboa. The Government of the United States is well aware of the importance to the Government and the people of Panama of constant and rapid communication across the Panama Canal at Balboa and is willing to agree to the construction of a tunnel under or a bridge over the Canal at that point, when the present emergency has ended. Pending the carrying out of this project, the Government of the United States will give urgent attention, consistent with the exigencies of the present emergency, to improving the present ferry service. 5. Jurisdiction over roads and highways in Panamanian Territory. The United States shall complete the construction at its own expense of the highways described below, under the conditions and with the materials specified : Highway A-3. ( Shall extend from Piña on the Atlantic side of the Isthmus to the Canal Zone boundary at the Rio Providencia. It shall be at least ten feet in width and constructed of macadam. ) Extension of the Trans-Isthmian Highway following the line of the P-8 road. ( Specifications shall be the same as for the TransIsthmian Highway. The extension shall start at Madrinal, by-passing Madden Dam by a bridge over the Chagres River below the Dam to connect with the P-8 road at Roque and shall extend the P-8 road from Pueblo Nuevo into Panama City. It is understood that the pavement of the bridge over the Chagres River will be located above the elevation established as the Canal Zone boundary. ) Upon the completion of these highways, the Government of the United States will assume the responsibility for any necessary post construction operations, that is, the performance of work necessary to perfect the original construction until such time as the roads become stabilized .
The Government of Panama guarantees that all roads under its jurisdiction used periodically or frequently by the armed forces of

59 STAT. ] PANAMA-GENERAL RELATIONS-MAY 18, 1942
the United States will be well and properly maintained at all times. The Government of Panama will ask for the cooperation of the Government of the United States in the performance of repair and maintenance work on the said roads whenever it deems necessary such cooperation in order to fulfill the aforesaid guarantee such as, for example, in the case of emergencies or situations which require prompt action.
The Government of the United States will bear one-third of the total annual maintenance cost of all Panamanian roads used periodically or frequently by the armed forces of the United States, such cost to cover the expense of any wear or damage to roads caused by movements related to defense activities. The amount payable by the United States will be based upon accounts presented annually by the Republic of Panama giving in detail the total annual expenditures made by it on each highway used periodically or frequently by the armed forces of the United States and upon accounts similarly presented by the Government of the United States giving in similar detail the expenditures made by that Government in response to requests from the Government of Panama as set forth above. In the event that the Government of the United States has rendered cooperation in the maintenance of the said roads , the expenses incurred by that Government in so doing will be credited toward the share of the United States in the total maintenance of the roads under the jurisdiction of Panama.
In consideration of the above obligations and responsibilities of the United States, the Government of the Republic of Panama grants the right of transit for the routine movement of the members of the armed forces of the United States, the civilian members of such forces and their families, as well as animals, animal-drawn and motor vehicles employed by the armed forces or by contractors employed by them for construction work or others whose activities are in any way related to the defense program, on roads constructed by the United States in territory under the jurisdiction of the Republic of Panama and on the other national highways which place the Canal Zone in communication with the defense areas and of the latter with each other. It should be understood that the United States will take at all times the precautions necessary to avoid, if possible , interruptions of transit in the Republic of Panama.
All roads constructed by the United States in the territory under the jurisdiction of the Republic of Panama shall be under the jurisdiction of Panama. As to those secondary roads constructed by the United States for the purpose of giving access to any defense site , Panama grants to the military authorities of the United States the right to restrict or prohibit public travel on such roads within a reasonable distance from such sites if such restriction or prohibition is necessary to the military protection of such sites. It is understood that such restriction or prohibition is without prejudice to the free access of the inhabitants established within the restricted areas to their respective properties. It is also understood that such restriction

1293

1294

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [ 59 Stat.
or prohibition is not to be exercised on any part of any main highway. 6. Labor for the Canal Zone. The Government of the United States is aware of the immigration
policies of the Republic of Panama as stated in Article XXIII of the Constitution of that Republic, promulgated on January 2, 1941 and , although jurisdiction over immigration into the Canal Zone rests solely with the Government of the United States, that Government will cooperate to the extent feasible under present circumstances in meeting the expressed policy of Panama in this matter. Specifically, the Government of the United States will endeavor so far as practical to fill the needs for labor in the Canal Zone with classes of persons
whose immigration is permitted by the Republic of Panama and will forbid the entry into the territory of the Republic, except as may be necessary on brief routine official business, of those persons whom Canal Zone authorities have found or may find it necessary to introduce into the Canal Zone but whose immigration into the Republic is prohibited by the Republic of Panama. Such persons will be repatriated when their services are no longer required.
7. Desire of the Panamanian Government that our military and Zone police be armed only with billies while in the territory of Panama.
The Government of the United States agrees that only the commissioned officers of the military police and the commissioned officers of the shore patrols of the United States when on duty in the cities of Panamá and Colón may carry side arms. It agrees that members of the Canal Zone municipal police may not carry side arms of any sort while in the Republic of Panama , and similarly, the Government of the Republic of Panama will agree that members of the police of the Republic of Panama shall not carry side arms while in the Canal Zone, except when the latter pass through the Zone in transit to other territory of the Republic.
8. Provision of electrical current from the Alhajuela Dam for use in the Republic.
The Government of the United States agrees that electrical energy, whenever an excess beyond the needs of the United States is available in commercial quantities at the generating station of the Panama Canal at Madden Dam, will be furnished upon request of the Panamanian Government , to the cities of Panamá and Colón at a price and at points to be agreed upon between the two Governments.
9. The assumption by the United States of the entire cost of the Rio Hato Highway.
The Government of the United States will, after the necessary funds have been obtained by appropriation from the Congress, liquidate the credit of $2,500,000 made available to the Republic of Panama by the Export-Import Bank for the construction of Panama's share of the Chorrera- Rio Hato road.
10. The moving of the railroad station at Panamá. The Government of the United States agrees to comply with the wishes of the Republic of Panama regarding the removal from their present site of the terminal facilities of the Panama Railroad in

59 STAT.] PANAMA-GENERAL RELATIONS- MAY 18, 1942

Panamá including the station , yards and other appurtenances. This agreement, however, is subject to the making available without cost to the Government of the United States by the Republic of Panama of a new site deemed suitable for the purpose by the two Governments.
11. Desire of the Panamanian Government for an indemnity in case traffic is interrupted on account of our troop movements.
The Government of the United States is not prepared at this time to enter into any formal agreement regarding indemnities for the interruption of traffic on the highways of the Republic of Panama. If, however, serious interruptions of traffic should occur, the Government of the United States will be pleased to examine in a friendly spirit any claims advanced by the Government of the Republic of Panama.

12. The desire of the Panamanian Government for three gasoline or oil tanks at Balboa.

The Government of the United States will make available to the

Republic of Panama a right-of-way beginning in the port of Balboa and ending at the Canal Zone-City of Panama boundary at a point to be agreed upon by the two Governments for the construction of a

petroleum pipeline. It will also agree that the facilities of the Panama Canal for discharging bulk petroleum products from ships berthed at Balboa and for the direction of such products into the pipeline above-mentioned would be made available in regular turn to the Republic of Panama at a reasonable cost. It should be understood that the Republic of Panama would bear the cost of the construction of the pipeline as well as pay for any damage which might accrue to the property of the United States as the result of the construction or maintenance thereof. The cost of pumping such petroleum products

from Balboa to the Canal Zone- City of Panama boundary would be borne by the Republic of Panama which would install and maintain the necessary pumping facilities for the purpose.
I should appreciate it if Your Excellency would confirm my understanding of the agreement reached as set forth above.
Accept, Excellency, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration .

que ha dividido en dos el Istmo panameño.

Este documento constituye un elocuente y noble ejemplo al mundo de que nuestros dos Gobiernos marchan por el sendero de la vida democrática en estrecha e íntima hermandad satisfaciendo así los

deseos de una verdadera unión Panamericana expresada por la colosal

figura de Simón Bolívar hace más de cien años y reiterada, en esta época, tan elocuente y brillantemente por la eminente personalidad de Franklin Delano Roosevelt por medio de su doctrina del Buen Vecino.

MR. SECRETARY :

With the greatest and most honored pleasure I acknowledge receipt of Your Excellency's note dated today, May 18, 1942, with reference to the memorandum which the then Ambassador of Panama near

Your Excellency's enlightened Government left with His Excellency the President of the United States on February 18, 1941 and to the memorandums of the Department of State dated July 8 , July 18 and December 2, 1941 , which concern the twelve points covering certain Panamanian aspirations regarding which positive action was requested of the Government of the United States.

59 STAT. ] PANAMA- GENERAL RELATIONS-MAY 18, 1942
It gives me the greatest honor to inform Your Excellency that after subsequent negotiations a mutual agreement has happily been reached between our two Governments respecting the twelve points as they were set forth in Your Excellency's note which becomes a most important document for us and for future generations since it embodies the acceptance by the Government of the United States of the equitable and just aspirations of the Government of my country and, at the same time, makes it obvious that the Government of Panama is prepared at any time to give complete and full cooperation to the Government of the United States in the defense of the interocean route which has divided the Panamanian isthmus in two.
This document constitutes an eloquent and noble example to the world that our Governments walk by the path of the democratic life in close and intimate brotherhood, thus satisfying the desires of a real Pan American union expressed by the colossal figure of Simón Bolívar more than one hundred years ago and so eloquently and brilliantly renewed in this era by the eminent personality of Franklin Delano Roosevelt through his Good Neighbor policy.

Your Excellency will recall that the United States Government, in contributing $350,000 toward this program and subsequently making available an additional $ 150,000 , to be used for the anti-yaws aspect of it, was acting in accordance with Resolution XXX regarding health and sanitary conditions, adopted by the Third Meeting of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the American Republics at Rio in 1942.

The Government of the United States will continue to furnish such experts as are considered necessary in order to collaborate with Your

Excellency's Government in extending the health and sanitation program .
All projects and property acquired in connection with the program shall be the property of the Government of Haiti.

SIR :

November 3, 1942.

I have the honor to refer to my note dated February 21 , 1942 [ ¹ ]

and to your note dated April 13, 1942 [¹ ] in reply with regard to

changes under consideration by my Government concerning vessels taken as prizes by United States Naval forces in foreign waters far from a United States port.

The changes in prize court procedure proposed by my Government are contained in Public Law 704-77th Congress, an Act to facilitate the disposition of prizes captured by the United States during the present war, and for other purposes, which was approved on August 18, 1942. [ 2 ] A copy of the Act is enclosed.

Section 3 of the Act provides that the authority contained in the Act shall not be exercised over prizes brought into the territorial waters of a cobelligerent , and that prizes shall not be taken or appropriated within such territorial waters for the use of the United States unless the government having jurisdiction over such territorial waters consents thereto .

Section 5 of the Act provides for the exercise abroad by special prize commissioners of the duties prescribed for such commissioners and such additional duties as the district courts of the United States

may deem necessary or proper for carrying out the purposes of the Act. The duties of prize commissioners are set out in Title 34, U.S.C. , Section 1138 , which reads as follows :

56 Stat. 746.

" 1138. Duties of prize commissioners. The prize commissioners, or one of them, shall receive from the prize master the documents and papers, and inventory thereof, and shall take the affidavit of the prize master required by section 1134 of this title, and shall forthwith take the testimony of the witnesses sent in, separate from each other, on interrogatories prescribed by the Court, in the manner usual in prize courts ; and the witnesses

[ See also proclamation of April 1 , 1943 ( 57 Stat. 736 ) . ]

1302 56 Stat. 747.

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [ 59 Stat.

shall not be permitted to see the interrogatories, documents, or papers, or to consult with counsel, or with any persons interested without special authority from the court ; and witnesses who have the rights of neutrals shall be discharged as soon as practicable. The prize commissioners shall also take depositions de bene esse of the prize crew and others, at the request of the district attorney , on interrogatories prescribed by the court. They shall also, as soon as any prize property comes within the district for adjudication, examine the same, and make an inventory thereof, founded on an actual examination , and report to the court whether any part of it is in a condition requiring immediate sale for the interests of all parties, and notify the district attorney thereof ; and if it be necessary to the examination or making of the inventory that the cargo be unladen , they shall apply to the court for an order to the marshal to unlade the same , and shall, from time to time, report to the court anything relating to the condition of the property, or its custody or disposal, which may require any action by the court, but the custody of the property shall be in the marshal only. They shall also seasonably return into court, sealed and secured from inspection, the documents and papers which shall come to their hands, duly scheduled and numbered, and the other preparatory evidence, and the evidence taken de bene esse, and their own inventory of the prize property ; and
if the captured vessel, or any of its cargo or stores, are such as in their judgment may be useful to the United States in war, they shall report the same to the Secretary of the Navy."

I have been instructed by my Government to request the Government of New Zealand , in view of the above provisions of law, to give its consent to the exercise within its jurisdiction of the authority contained in the Act. Upon the receipt of such consent, appropriate measures will be taken by my Government in accordance with Section 7 of the Act to accord reciprocal privileges in prize matters to the Government of New Zealand. I would therefore be grateful to have the reply of the Government of New Zealand in this matter at as early a moment as possible for communication to my Government.

SIR :

WASHINGTON, February 28, 1945.

In the United Nations' declaration of January 1, 1942, the contracting governments pledged themselves to employ their full resources, military or economic, against those nations with which they are at war ; and in the Preliminary Agreement of February 28, 1945 between the Government of the United States and the Provisional Government of France on the principles applying to mutual aid, each contracting government undertakes to provide the other with such articles, services, facilities, or information useful in the prosecution of their common war effort as it might be in a position to supply. It is the understanding of the Provisional Government of France that the general principle to be followed in providing mutual aid as set forth

55 Stat. 1600. Ante, p. 1304.

1314 Ante, p. 1304.

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [ 59 STAT.
in the said Agreement of February 28, 1945 is that the war production and the war resources of both Nations should be used by each in ways which most effectively utilize the available materials, manpower, production facilities, shipping space, and other resources.
With a view, therefore, to supplementing the said Agreement of February 28, 1945 and the Memorandum relating to Lend-Lease and Reciprocal Aid and the Minutes attached thereto, agreed and exchanged by the United States and French representatives on August 25, 1944, [ ¹ ] we have the honor to set forth below the understanding of the Provisional Government of France of the principles and procedures applicable to the provision of aid by the Provisional Government of France to the armed forces of the United States and the manner in which such aid will be correlated with the maintenance of those forces by the United States Government.
1. The Provisional Government of France, retaining the right of final decision, in the light of its own potentialities and responsibilities, will provide the United States or its armed forces with the following types of assistance as reciprocal aid , when and to the extent that it is found that they can most effectively be procured in continental France.
(A ) Military equipment, munitions, and military and naval stores ;
(B) Other supplies, materials, facilities , services, or information for United States forces, except for the pay, allowances, and other emoluments of such forces and the administrative expenses of American Missions ;
(C) Supplies, materials, facilities, services, or information except for the wages and salaries of United States citizens, needed in the construction of military projects, tasks, and similar capital works required in the common war effort ;
(D) Settlement and payment of appropriate civil claims arising in French territory against the United States and its armed forces, employees, and officers ;
( E) Ship ballast , in order to assist in obtaining maximum efficiency in the use of shipping ; provided , however, that any net proceeds resulting from the sale of such ballast shall be paid to the Provisional Government of France ;
( F ) Such other supplies, materials, facilities or services as may be agreed upon as necessary in the prosecution of the war, including materials for war production, requested by the United States to be exported from continental France to the United States of America.
2. The practical application of the principles formulated in this note, including the procedure by which requests for aid by either Government are made and acted upon, shall be worked out as occasion may require by agreement between the two Governments, acting when possible through their appropriate military or civilian administrative authorities. Requests by the United States Government for such aid will be presented by duly authorized authorities of the United States
1 [Not printed .]

59 STAT. ]

FRANCE- MUTUAL AID- FEB. 28, 1945

1315

to official agencies of the Provisional Government of France which will

be designated or established at convenient locations for the purpose of

facilitating the provision of reciprocal aid. 3. It is the understanding of the Provisional Government of France

that all such aid, as well as other aid , including information, received under Article VI of the Preliminary Agreement of February 28, 1945, accepted by the President of the United States or his authorized

Ante, p. 1306.

representatives from the Provisional Government of France will be received as a benefit to the United States under the Act of March 11 , 1941. Insofar as circumstances will permit, appropriate record of aid received under this arrangement will be kept by each Government.

military operation and until such time as the official agencies of the Provisional Government of France are able to provide such reciprocal aid in the manner contemplated in Section 2, the Provisional Govern-

ment of France agrees to make available to designated officers of the United States Government such French currency or credits as may be

needed for the purpose. The necessary arrangements will be made by the appropriate authorities of the Government of the United States and the Provisional Government of France.

If the Government of the United States concurs in the foregoing,

we would suggest that the present note and your reply to that effect be regarded as placing on record the understanding of our two Governments in this matter and that for clarity and convenience of administration this understanding be considered to be effective as from June 6, 1944.

Accept, Sir, the renewed assurances of our highest consideration.

Provisional Government of the French Republic to the proposed agreement under Section 3 ( c ) of the Lend-Lease Act and in particular to Article V thereof. Under Article V this Government will review, from time to time, and particularly at the conclusion of hostilities in Europe, as determined by the President, articles and services set forth in Schedule 1 and Schedule 2 of the Agreement in order to de-

termine whether the delivery of such articles or services should be withheld in the national interest of the United States. The reserva-

tion made by this Government in Article V to withhold delivery of articles and services "whenever the President determines that such

action is in the national interest" constitutes a broad power to cancel

or revoke procurement programs or contracts. It is not possible to predict with precision what occasions or circumstances may arise in the future which may require this Government to withhold delivery. Actual delivery will always be subject to the development of the military situation , and the changing demands of strategy, as well as to economic and financial factors which affect the national interest of this Government.

The Government of the United States expects that all articles and services transferred to the Provisional Government of the French

Republic, pursuant to the Crowley-Monnet exchange of notes of September 4, 5 and 19, 1944, [1 ] prior to the signing of this Agreement

will be paid for in dollars, and any articles and services requisitioned in accordance with the provisions of these notes but transferred following the signing of this Agreement will be regarded , if appropriate, as deliveries under the relevant schedules of the Agreement.

It is further understood that as long as supplies are furnished under the so-called Plan "A", the Provisional Government of the

1 ¹ [Not printed. ]

MY DEAR MR. SECRETARY,

I have just returned from France. As the American Ambassador in

Paris has been advised by our Minister of Foreign Affairs, my Govern-

ment is now prepared to sign the draft agreements sent to me by Mr.

Clayton on February 8th, 1945.

In its concurrence, my Government has taken full cognizance of your Memorandum accompanying the draft agreements.

Before my departure for Paris I agreed with Mr. Clayton the text of

a Statement, attached hereto, which clarifies certain points and draws

the attention of your Government to certain policies which we shall follow in the execution of the various agreements.

Yours sincerely,

JEAN MONNET.

The Honorable JOSEPH C. GREW, Acting Secretary of State, Department of State, Washington, D. C.

STATEMENT 28 FEBRUARY 1945.
I. We understand that the Master Agreement covers munitions now being or to be supplied hereafter on a straight Lend-Lease basis.
2. ARTICLE 5. We understand that in general it is not the intention of the United States Government to exercise its right to recapture any articles for which the French Government pays ; if the recap-' ture clause should be exercised in respect to any such articles, appropriate arrangements will be made for repayment to the French Government.
3. ARTICLES 6 AND 7. We understand that "benefits provided to the United States by the Provisional Government of France" includes

1317

1318

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [ 59 STAT.

benefits provided by the Comite National, the Haut Commandement en Chef, and the C.F.L.N. and that in the conversations referred to in Article VII full cognizance will be taken of all such benefits as well as of all aid extended under the various operating agreements and the Master Agreement.

" Continental France."
"Net losses."

B. 3(c) Agreement
I. ARTICLE I. We understand that the phrase "Continental France" includes Corsica.
2. ARTICLE V. We understand that the phrase "net losses" refers to out-of-pocket expenses , such as contract cancellation , transportation and storage expenses, incurred with respect to articles covered by a requisition or other formal request filed by the French Government .
C. Reciprocal Aid Agreement

The franc account provision appears unnecessarily broad. We understand that you are prepared to substitute for it a provision which will be consistent with mutually agreeable working arrangements now in effect in France.

II.

The purchase price clauses set forth in Section B of Schedule I of the 3 (c) agreement are complex. There is some doubt in our minds

that their precise operative effect can be accurately predicted now. On the other hand, we recognize that they have been drafted with the purpose of establishing a pricing method that will be fair to both

parties. Accordingly we ask for no revision at the present time. If

the pricing operations under these formulae appear unsatisfactory

in practice, we will feel free to propose an alternative method . The adoption of such an alternative by mutal agreement would not, of course, be retroactive, unless the propriety of such retroactive action

were also mutually agreed .

III .

Statement of policy. I wish also to direct your attention to certain policies we shall follow in the execution of these various arrangements.
I. In relation to reciprocal aid, it is our intention to put forth our maximum effort. The extent of reciprocal aid which it will be possible to render will , however, necessarily depend in large measure on such factors as the availability of labor, power, and the flow of imported supplies.
2. In relation to the 3 (c ) agreement, it is our general intention to request and receive the articles and services in Schedules I and
2 up to the full amount of the financial limits provided for therein. However, we note our reserved right to have the programs or contracts cancelled upon paying the United States its out-of- pocket expenses ; and it is our intention to review the articles and services

59 STAT. ]

in the schedules from time to time and particularly at the conclusion of hostilities in Europe in order to make such adjustments in our requests and acceptances as we deem necessary in the light of the changing situation.

EXCELLENCY :

I have the honor to refer to an agreement for cooperative planta-

tion rubber investigations which was effected by the signing of a letter dated January 24 , 1941 , by the Chief of the Bureau of Plant

Industry, United States Department of Agriculture, and the Secretary

of State for Agriculture and Labor of the Republic of Haiti , the text of which letter reads in full as follows :

Object of investigations.

"MONSIEUR SECRETAIRE : "In recognition of the common interest of the Haitian Govern-
ment and the Government of the United States in the development of rubber production in Latin America and the desirability that Haiti participate in this development, both for the purpose of developing new export crops and for developing new sources of national income, it seems possible to provide for mutually advantageous cooperation .
"Discussions between representatives of the Bureau of Plant Industry and representatives of the Haitian Government have developed a basis of understanding, which is presented in the following paragraphs for your consideration . If the statement of the project and provision for carrying out the work meet with your approval, please endorse this letter in the space provided and return it to me. A photostat copy will then be sent to you for your records.
"The object of these cooperative investigations is to develop and propagate high-yielding clones of rubber resistant to the South American leaf disease. Seed , budwood , and other plant materials

"The Bureau of Plant Industry agrees to test the performance of seedlings derived from seeds from Haiti, to furnish the Haitian Government selected and tested budwood from time to time, to give advice and information and to furnish the services of a scientist for planning, conducting and interpreting the results of the work performed under the terms of this agreement.

As a result of practical considerations which have arisen in connection with the operation of the regional field station for rubber experimentation in accordance with the agreement mentioned above, it has been found by the authorities of the United States Department of Agriculture to be desirable that an agreement supplementary to the agreement of January 24 , 1941 be entered into for the purpose of defining more clearly certain procedures affecting the sale of products grown on the lands used by the said station and in order to facilitate the continued development of rubber investigations and demonstration plantings in Haiti.
The supplementary agreement as proposed by the United States Department of Agriculture is in terms as follows :
ARTICLE I
In the sale of products , surplus to the needs of the cooperative research and recognized as the property of the Government of the Republic of Haiti, which have been grown and are now on, or which are or may be developed or cultivated as a result of rubber investigations and demonstration plantings on, the lands owned by the Government of the Republic of Haiti and provided by the Government of the Republic of Haiti for the establishment and operation by the Department of Agriculture of the United States of America of a rubber experiment station, in accordance with the letter agreement for cooperative rubber investigations in Haiti, between appropriate authorities of the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of Haiti , dated January 24,

59 STAT.] HAITI- RUBBER INVESTIGATIONS- Dec. 29, 1944 Jan. 8, 1945

1941 , the following procedures shall be followed with respect to such sales and with respect to accounting and disbursements :
(a) Any such sale shall be made by the Secretary of State for Agriculture and Labor of the Republic of Haiti and the proceeds from any such sale shall be placed in a special account with the understanding that such proceeds shall be used for the improvement and development of the rubber experiment station , the demonstration plantings, and the lands aforesaid.
(b) The system of accounting for farm receipts and disbursements will be formulated and approved by the Secretary of State for Agriculture and Labor of the Republic of Haiti and the local representatives in charge of rubber investigations for the Department of Agriculture of the United States of America.
ARTICLE II

This supplementary agreement shall remain in force as though it were an integral part of the aforesaid letter agreement dated January 24 , 1941 .

This note , together with a reply from Your Excellency indicating the approval of the Government of the Republic of Haiti , will be considered as constituting an agreement between our two Governments on the subject, it being understood that the letter agreement of January 24, 1941 became effective, in accordance with its own terms, on the date of its endorsement , and that the supplementary agreement as indicated above shall be effective as of the date of Your Excellency's reply note.
Accept, Excellency, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration.

As a result of practical considerations which have arisen in connection with the operation of the regional field station for rubber experimentation in accordance with the agreement mentioned above, it has been found by the authorities of the United States Department of Agriculture to be desirable that an agreement supplementary to the agreement of January 24 , 1941 be entered into for the purpose of defining more clearly certain procedures affecting the sale of products grown on the lands used by the said station and in order to facilitate the continued development of rubber investigations and demonstration plantings in Haiti .
The supplementary agreement as proposed by the United States Department of Agriculture is in terms as follows:

EXCELLENCY :

Ankara, February 23, 1945.

Confirming the Aide Memoire which I handed to Your Excellency

on October 21 , 1944 , I have the honor to inform Your Excellency as follows:

" 1. Since the Government of the United States cannot foresee

55 Stat. 31. 22 U. S. C., Supp .
IV, §§ 411-419. Ante, p. 52.

its own future needs for material which it has transferred to other Governments under the provisions of the Lend-Lease Act, it would not want to bind itself at this time to relinquishing the right to request the return of such materials as it might find desirable to

Ante, p. 1477.

have returned to the United States for the reasons set forth in Article V. However, the Government of the United States would,

at a mutually convenient time after the signing of the agreement,

provide the Turkish Government every opportunity to discuss with the Government of the United States the retention of such

Ante, p. 1477.

materials as the Turkish Government might desire to purchase. "2. In Article VII , the signatories agree to collaborate with all

other countries of like mind for the economic objectives described

in that article. Since it is recognized, for example, that the reduction of trade barriers is a matter for action by each country in

accordance with its own constitutional procedures, provision is

made for conversations to determine the best means of attaining

the stated objectives of each Government by their own ' agreed' action .

"3. With respect to the inquiry of the Turkish Government as to whether the signature of the agreement would be availed of by Washington to terminate Lend-Lease aid to Turkey, the response is made that it is not the intention of the Government of the United

States to use the signing of the agreement as a basis for terminating Lend-Lease aid to Turkey . The amount of aid in the future will naturally depend on the material available and upon the course of the war."

Accept, Excellency, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration .

En confirmation de l'Aide-Mémoire que j'ai remis à Votre Excellence, le 21 octobre 1944 , j'ai l'honneur de porter à la connaissance de Votre Excellence ce qui suit:
"1. Puisque le Gouvernement des Etats-Unis ne peut pas prévoir ses besoins futurs de matériel qu'il a transféré à d'autres Gouvernements selon les termes de la Loi Prêt-et-Bail , il ne désirerait pas s'engager à présent à renoncer au droit de demander le retour de

ces matériaux dont le renvoi aux Etats-Unis pourrait être avantageux pour les raisons exposées dans l'Article V. Cependant, le Gouvernement des Etats-Unis offrirait au Gouvernement Turc, à une date qui conviendrait, après la signature de l'accord , toutes les facilités pour délibérer avec le Gouvernement des Etats-Unis dans

le but de garder les matériaux que le Gouvernement Turc désirerait acheter.

"2. Par l'Article VII, les signataires s'engagent à collaborer avec tous les autres pays qui sont d'accord pour poursuivre les buts économiques exposés dans cet Article. Puisqu'il est reconnu, par exemple, que la réduction d'obstacles au commerce est une question

1. In general, foodstuffs and other supplies for the civilian population of Iraq shall continue to be furnished through regular commer-

be provided for the civilian population of Iraq under the Lend-Lease Act shall be furnished on the basis of current payment by the Iraqi

Government, and other goods and services may be furnished on that

basis by agreement from time to time. In the absence of special

agreement, such payment shall be in United States dollars ; however,

by agreement between the two Governments prior to delivery pay-

ment may be made in Iraqi dinars or in goods or services. Articles

obtained by the Iraqi Government in accordance with the provisions

2. Such payments as may be made in Iraqi dinars shall be deposited to the credit of the Government of the United States of America in a

depositary in Iraq to be selected by the United States Government.

These deposits may be freely drawn upon and used by the Government

of the United States of America . The Government of Iraq will permit the exportation to any destination desired by the United States of

America of any materials and products purchased by the United States of America with such deposits . In any transactions envisaged

it is agreed that if substantial amounts of materials or assistance furnished or to be furnished under the Lend-Lease Act or otherwise, by any Agency of the United States Government without current

payment by the Government of Iraq have been or shall be employed

by either of our two Governments, during the present war, in the

construction of any installations on Iraqi territory , the disposition of

such installations remaining on Iraqi territory after the present war

shall be governed by an agreement or agreements to which both our

Governments shall be parties . Such agreement or agreements shall

make appropriate provision for the future ownership and operation of the installation or installations in question, and for the payments

ultimately be borne by such other Government. (3) Each contracting Government agrees to waive all claims

EXCELLENCY : I have the honor to refer to the communications between the Acting
Secretary of State of the United States of America and the MinisterCounselor of the Ecuadoran Embassy in Washington , D.C. , dated February 24, 1942, relating to the initiation of the cooperative program of public health and sanitation in Ecuador. Your Excellency will recall that the United States Government, subsequent to the exchange of these communications, has allocated the sum of two million seven hundred and fifty thousand five hundred dollars ( $2,750,500.00 U.S. ) to be used in carrying out the cooperative health and sanitation program in accordance with resolution XXX approved at the Third Meeting of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the American Republics, held at Rio de Janeiro in January, 1942 .
I have the honor to state that my Government is prepared , if Your Excellency's Government so desires , to make available , through the Institute of Inter-American Affairs an additional sum of two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000.00 U.S. ) for the purpose of cooperating with the Government of Ecuador in prolonging the aforementioned program of health and sanitation on the understanding that the Government of Ecuador for its part will contribute the sum of two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000.00 U.S.) , both at an agreed rate of exchange. The extension of the program would terminate December 31 , 1947, insofar as the funds contributed by the United States are concerned .

The type of work and specific projects to be undertaken and the cost thereof and the methods and procedures to be employed in conducting
the program would be mutually agreed to by the appropriate official of the Government of Ecuador and an appropriate official of the Institute of Inter-American Affairs.
The Government of the United States of America would continue to furnish such experts as would be considered necessary in order to collaborate with Your Excellency's Government in continuing the health and sanitation program.

I would be glad if Your Excellency would be so good as to confirm to me your approval of this general proposal with the understanding that the program would be a subject of further discussion and agreement as provided for herein.

PERUVIAN EMBASSY WASHINGTON 6, D.C.

YOUR EXCELLENCY :

DECEMBER 21, 1944.

With reference to informal conversations which have been held by officers of the Department of State with Dr. Eduardo Garland , Minister-Counsellor of the Peruvian Embassy, regarding a Second Peruvian-United States Cooperative Fellowship Program, and in view of the excellent results reached by the accomplishment of the

understanding outlined in the Department of State Memorandum dated July 30 , 1942 [ 1 ] and the Embassy's note of August 4, 1942 for a special technical training granted in educational institutions of the United States for advance students of Peru, I have been instructed by the Peruvian Government to inform Your Excellency that the Peruvian Government will be glad to agree to a program of this nature to be undertaken as follows :

The program will cover fifteen ( 15 ) fellowships at the graduate level for study in the United States, expenses and responsibilities of which will be taken care of as follows :

The Peruvian Government will attend to travel expenses from stu-
dent's residence in Peru to the place of study in the United States and return, tuition expenses during orientation and tuition expenses if necessary to place a student in a field of study specified by the Peruvian Government for which no fellowship is available.
The United States Government will handle maintenance expenses for twelve ( 12 ) months at place of study, including orientation period, in standard amounts now paid in the different localities and not exceeding $135.00 per month.
The Institute of International Education will take care of the
acquisition of tuition fellowship for each candidate at principal place of study, in so far as possible, placement of candidates at appropriate institutions of higher learning in the United States and supervision of students, including periodical reports on their progress.
To achieve the best possible results the Peruvian Government considers that the following procedure be adopted for the program :

[Not printed .]

59 STAT. ] PERU-COOPERATIVE FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM- Dec. 21 , 1944 Jan. 4, 1945
1. Fields of study. The Peruvian Government will decide on the fields of study in which technical instruction is to be given and on the number of persons to be appointed to each field. This information will be submitted as soon as possible to the Department of State in order that the Institute of International Education may earmark the necessary fellowships for as many fields as possible and send information to Peru regarding the general requirements for study in each field for the guidance of the selection authorities.
2. Selection of candidates. Candidates would submit their applications on forms of the Institute of International Education which
would be filed with the Peruvian-North American Fellowship and Scholarship Committee in Lima. For the purpose of this program , the Peruvian Government would, should it so desire, appoint two representatives to sit with the Committee and have a voice in its proceedings. If possible, two candidates will be submitted for each
fellowship . 3. Standards of eligibility. The awards will be made to persons
with university or superior normal school degrees who have had at least one year of practical experience in the respective fields in which they wish to pursue graduate studies ; who demonstrate that they possess a working knowledge of the English language ; who have better than average academic records ; who have satisfactory personality and potential adaptability to living abroad ; and who are in good health .
4. Present location of candidates. The awards will be made to persons now in Peru who have not previously received fellowship assistance from the United States Government.
5. Orientation course. For the purpose of adequately preparing the Peruvian students to undertake the advanced courses most effectively, the students will be given orientation courses in the language and customs of the United States upon their arrival. This course will be given at the place agreed upon by the Department of State, the Peruvian Embassy in Washington , and the Institute of International Education, and the tuition charges therefor will be borne by the Peruvian Government.
6. Announcement of program. Public announcement of the program will be made simultaneously in Peru and in the United States at a mutually agreeable time.
7. Time schedule. It is suggested that the following schedule be adopted :
Public Announcement shall be arranged for upon receipt of a reply from the Department of State to this note.
December 20, 1944-February 1, 1945-Receipt of applications by Selection Committee.

9. Other conditions. Candidates must obligate themselves to return to Peru on the conclusion of their studies.

DEPARTMENT OF STATE WASHINGTON

EXCELLENCY :

April 2, 1945

I have the honor to refer to the verbal indication made on March

23, 1945, by an officer of the Ecuadoran Embassy to an officer of the Department of State that Your Excellency's Government desires to conclude an agreement with this Government with respect to the

application of the United States Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, as amended , to Ecuadoran nationals residing in the United States.
As you are aware, the Act provides that with certain exceptions every male citizen of the United States and every other male person between

the ages of eighteen and sixty-five residing in the United States shall

register. The Act further provides that, with certain exceptions,

registrants within specified age limits are liable for active military service in the United States armed forces.

Nationals of cobelligerent countries.

This Government recognizes that from the standpoint of morale of

the individuals concerned and the over-all military effort of the coun-

tries at war with the Axis Powers, it is desirable to permit certain

nationals of cobelligerent countries who have registered or who may

register under the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 , as

amended, to enlist in the armed forces of their own country, should

they desire to do so. It will be recalled that during the World War this Government signed conventions with certain associated powers

on this subject. The United States Government believes , however, that under existing circumstances the same ends may now be accomplished through administrative action , thus obviating the delays incident to the signing and ratification of conventions. Induction procedure This Government has , therefore , initiated a procedure permitting aliens who have registered under the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, as amended , who are nationals of certain cobelligerent countries and who have not declared their intention of becoming American citizens to elect to serve in the forces of their respective countries, in lieu of service in the armed forces of the United States, at any time prior to their induction into the armed forces of this country. This Government is also affording to such nationals , who may already be serving in the armed forces of the United States, an

59 STAT. ] ECUADOR- MILITARY SERVICE-APR. 2, 5, 1945

opportunity of electing to transfer to the armed forces of their own

country. The details of the procedure are arranged directly between

the War Department and the Selective Service System on the part of

the United States Government and the appropriate authorities of the cobelligerent government concerned . It should be understood , how-

ever, that in all cases a person exercising an option under the procedure must actually be accepted by the military authorities of the

country of his allegiance before his departure from the United States. Before the above-mentioned procedure is made effective with respect
to a cobelligerent country, this Department wishes to receive from the

Stipulations to be agreed to by cobellig-
erent country.

diplomatic representative in Washington of that country a note stating

that his government desires to avail itself of the procedure and in so doing agrees that :

(a ) No threat or compulsion of any nature will be exercised by his government to induce any person in the United States to enlist in the forces of his or any foreign government ;
(b) Reciprocal treatment will be granted to American citizens by his government ; that is, prior to induction in the armed forces of his government they will be granted the opportunity of electing to serve in the armed forces of the United States in substantially the same manner as outlined above. Furthermore, his government shall agree to inform all American citizens serving in its armed forces or former American citizens who may have lost their citizenship as a result of having taken an oath of allegiance on enlistment in such armed forces and who are now serving in those forces that they may transfer to the armed forces of the United States provided they desire to do so and provided they are acceptable to the armed forces of the United States. The arrangements for effecting such transfers are to be worked out by the appropriate representatives of the armed forces of the respective governments ;
(c) No enlistments will be accepted in the United States by his government of American citizens subject to registration or of aliens of any nationality who have declared their intention of becoming American citizens and are subject to registration.

This Government is prepared to make the proposed regime effective immediately with respect to Ecuador upon the receipt from you of a note stating that your Government desires to participate in it and agrees to the stipulations set forth in lettered paragraphs ( a) , ( b) , and ( c) above.
Accept, Excellency, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration .

Tengo a honra llevar a conocimiento de Vuestra Excelencia que he recibido instrucciones de mi Gobierno para aceptar el arreglo administrativo sobre la aplicación a ciudadanos venezolanos que se encuentran en este país de la Ley de Entrenamiento y Servicio Selectivo de los Estados Unidos, de 1940, arreglo que ha sido propuesto en la nota que Vuestra Excelencia me ha dirigido con fecha 10 del mes en curso.
El Gobierno de Venezuela conviene, en condiciones de reciprocidad, en la opción propuesta a favor de los ciudadanos venezolanos que se han registrado bajo la citada ley, o que se encuentran ya al servicio del ejército de los Estados Unidos, para solicitar su transferencia al ejército de Venezuela. A este respecto mi Gobierno acepta también las garantías señaladas en los parágrafos a) , b) y c) de la nota arriba citada .
Considero oportuno señalar que, de acuerdo con la Ley del Servicio Militar Obligatorio de Venezuela , los ciudadanos venezolanos en el extranjero que hayan alcanzado la edad correspondiente, están obligados a inscribirse en las oficinas consulares respectivas de la República para servir militarmente en las fuerzas armadas de Venezuela, y que el no cumplimiento de esta obligación trae aparejada la correspondiente sanción penal.
Mi Gobierno espera que el cumplimiento de esta obligación legal por parte de un venezolano, no sea considerada como una infracción a la garantía estipulada en el parágrafo a ) de la nota que contesto, desde el momento que no implica ninguna presión individual aislada y ad hoc.
El Gobierno venezolano se dispone a dar vigencia inmediata al convenio de que me ocupo, y a examinar los detalles de su aplicación con las autoridades del Gobierno de los Estados Unidos.

The Government of Venezuela agrees , on reciprocal terms , to the

option proposed on behalf of the Venezuelan citizens who have registered under the said Act, or who have already entered the service of

the United States Army, to apply for transfer to the Venezuelan Army. In this respect, my Government likewise accepts the guarantees indicated in paragraphs a ) , b ) , and c ) of the aforementioned note.

Ante, p. 1603.

I deem opportune to point out that, in keeping with the compulsory Military Service Law of Venezuela , Venezuelan citizens abroad who

have attained the corresponding age are obliged to register in the

respective consular offices of the Republic, in order to serve in the

armed forces of Venezuela , and that failure to comply with this obliga-

tion involves, without further process, the corresponding penal sanction.

My Government hopes that compliance with this legal obligation by a Venezuelan citizen will not be interpreted as an infraction of the guarantee stipulated in paragraph a ) of the note I am now answering, since it implies no ad hoc pressure on any single individual.
The Venezuelan Government is ready to enforce at once the agreement in question, and to go over the details for its application with the authorities of the United States Government.
I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the assurances of my highest consideration.

No. 266

WASHINGTON, D. C., July 21, 1944.

SIR, I have the honour to refer to the Convention between Canada and

the United States for the Protection, Preservation and Extension of the Sockeye Salmon Fisheries in the Fraser River System , signed at Washington on May 26 , 1930.
2. Under Article 111 of the Convention, the International Pacific

Salmon Fisheries Commission is required to "make a thorough investigation into the natural history of the Fraser River sockeye salmon, into hatchery methods , spawning ground conditions and other related matters " . The Commission may also recommend to the two Governments "removing or otherwise overcoming obstructions to the ascent of sockeye salmon, that may now exist or may from time to time occur, in any of the waters covered by this Convention, where investigation may show such removal of or other action to overcome obstructions to be desirable".

3. As a result of extensive investigation the Commission recommended to the two Governments on January 11 , 1944 , remedial

measures for overcoming obstructions to the ascent of the salmon in Hell's Gate Canyon and further investigation and remedial measures for overcoming obstructions to the ascent of the salmon elsewhere in the Fraser River watershed. It was estimated that the costs of the

works recommended would be $2,000,000 , which, in accordance with

Article 111 , paragraph 2 , of the Convention, would be shared equally between the two Governments . One copy of the letter and memorandum from the Commission under date of January 11 , signed by the chairman and secretary are attached hereto as appendix A. Also attached as appendix B is one copy of a list of the remedial works recommended by the Commission.

4. The Canadian Government has approved of these recommendations of the Commission as set forth in its letter and report of January

11. A vote of $ 1,000,000 to provide for Canada's share of the costs. of these works has been recommended to Parliament. The Commis-

sion has also been authorized by Order in Council P. C. 5002 of June 30, 1944 , to let contracts for the remedial works recommended . One

copy of Order in Council P. C. 5002 , marked appendix C , is attached hereto .

59 STAT. ] CANADA- SOCKEYE SALMON FISHERIES- July 21, 1944 Aug. 5, 1944
5. The regular procedure for the payment of expenses properly incurred by the Commission is that such expenses are paid by the Canadian Government, one-half being recoverable later by Canada from the United States . This procedure was agreed to by the United States by your note of December 10, 1937. [ '] It is acceptable to the Canadian Government that this procedure should be followed with respect to expenditures incurred by the Commission for the proposed remedial works .
6. It would appear desirable that the recommendations of the Commission as set forth in its letter and report of January 11 , 1944 and the arrangements proposed for implementing these recommendations should be formally approved by Exchange of Notes between the two Governments .
7. If these proposals are acceptable to the Government of the United States , this note and your reply thereto accepting the proposals shall be regarded as placing on record the agreement of the two governments concerning this matter.

APPENDIX "A"

January 11th, 1944.
SIR, In the Pacific Northwest a particularly valuable species of salmon,
known as Sockeye, was once so abundant that in 1913 it produced a pack of almost a quarter of a billion one pound cans which, at present prices, would be worth over forty million dollars. Now, one-eighth of that amount is considered a good pack .
The blasting of rocks during railroad construction in a narrow gorge of the Fraser River known as Hell's Gate Canyon, is charged with causing this huge decline by obstructing passage of the fish to their up-river spawning grounds. It is now believed , however, that great numbers of fish were fatally retarded at this canyon even under natural conditions.
Canada and the United States created this Commission to rehabili-
tate this once enormous food supply of the two nations-for though the spawning all takes place in Canada, United States fishermen get first chance to catch the fish as they pass through Puget Sound to approach the Fraser River mouth .
After intensive investigation it has been conclusively shown that the terrific rush and surge of water at Hell's Gate Canyon is largely responsible for failure of the salmon run to recover its former magnitude . Furthermore, the Commission finds that construction of socalled fish-ladders at this point will largely eliminate the difficulty. Some lesser obstructions also should be eliminated.
The Treaty requires the Commission to recommend to the two Governments the removal of obstructions. Accordingly the Commission herewith submits a biological report showing the necessity for action, an engineering report showing the action required , and a request for two million dollars with which to accomplish the desired result.
Respectfully submitted , INTERNATIONAL PACIFIC SALMON FISHERIES COMMISSION

1617

RECOMMENDATION OF INTERNATIONAL PACIFIC SALMON FISHERIES COMMISSION FOR OVERCOMING OBSTRUCTIONS TO THE ASCENT OF SOCKEYE SALMON, PURSUANT TO TERMS OF A TREATY BETWEEN CANADA AND THE UNITED STATES
The International Pacific Salmon Fisheries Commission was created for the purpose of rehabilitating a Pacific Coast salmon run known as the sockeye salmon of the Fraser River. In its largest year this run produced almost a quarter of a billion pounds of finest quality canned salmon which at present prices would have a value of more than forty million dollars . An eighth of that amount is now considered a good pack.
Among causes suggested for this great decline were need for international regulation and damage to the runs by blasting of rocks and by rock slides during railroad construction in the narrow gorge of the Fraser River, up which the fish must ascend to reach their spawning grounds. The first function of the Commission was to determine what were the actual causes, next to suggest remedies, and after eight years to regulate the catch .
Sockeye salmon normally spawn in late summer or fall in gravel beds in streams which are near lakes , or in the lakes themselves in the upper Fraser River drainage area, some 90,000 square miles in extent. The eggs hatch in early spring, and the young usually spend a year in lakes , then go down to sea and when four years old return to the very stream in which they were born, then in turn to spawn and die. The production of each stream therefore depends upon the run to that stream four years before . In a big river system like the Fraser with its numerous feeder streams there are therefore many separate runs each year. These may occur at different times during a season, though in fact there is much overlapping of such runs.
If the salmon had to keep on their way upstream or die and a run lasted only 30 days and there was a period of 30 days right at the time of such run when the fish could not pass up the river, the conclusion would be natural that such run would not reproduce itself. The problem is not that simple. However, the Commission did find that salmon could only stand a limited delay and that if the delay exceeded such limit they dropped downstream and were lost for reproductive purposes .
The Commission further found that there were specific levels of the river during which the salmon were unable to get up through the terrific rush of water at Hell's Gate Canyon and that these impassable levels occurred during the salmon season, but varied greatly in time, length, and seriousness from year to year. In some years practically all the runs which had survived to that year got through. In other years the entire season was nearly impassable (in 1941 it is estimated that one

1618

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [59 STAT.
million fish were unable to ascend the Canyon, dropped down below and died) . In some years certain runs were affected ; others were not .
It was also found that , although Hell's Gate Canyon was by far the most serious obstruction of this character, there were other places in the river system, each of which took its toll. Some forty such obstructions were specifically noted, of greatly varying importance, but a much more thorough survey of the seriousness of each , and of conditions at other points where difficulty may exist than the Commission has thus far been able to make , is essential. Moreover, the Commission found large areas apparently suitable to salmon spawning which never had been utilized because of some natural obstruction , and that it was probable that an adequate survey and proper remedial action would be the means of opening up such areas, thereby increasing the productivity of the system beyond what it had ever been.
A most important consideration is that a depleted run of sockeye salmon if given a reasonable opportunity recuperates rapidly. There are, however, great areas to which the runs of certain years have been completely destroyed . Such areas require distinctive treatment . Moreover, any measure of redress , in order to be effective , will require the aid of regulation of the catch.
Viewing the entire field, the Commission found that it would be uneconomical and unsound, if not wholly futile , to attempt to resort to any recuperative or regulatory measure if the same might in any year be rendered fruitless by reason of the restored runs being again depleted by being obstructed in their attempted passage up Hell's Gate Canyon or other points of difficulty.
Accordingly, it is essential that as a first step in an orderly rehabilitation of the sockeye salmon of the Fraser River system as a whole that this continuous threat of destruction at Hell's Gate Canyon be removed. After that, many runs will promptly proceed to restore themselves and this natural process can be going on while the Commission effectuates its plan to bring back lost runs as well as those so close to extinction as to require artificial stimulation, and to produce runs into new areas. Gradual removal of minor obstructions can also
be carried on concurrently, as biological and engineering studies indicate the corrective action necessary.
These facts and conclusions are the result of six years of intensive investigation of every available source of information from official and commercial records and from one of the largest fish tagging experiments ever conducted , many thousands of fish having been tagged in salt water and at different parts of the river with observable celluloid tags these then having been collected by means of rewards and otherwise, also by the use of trained observers systematically stationed throughout the area.
Submitted herewith is a biological report from the Commission's scientific staff which presents a remarkable record of investigation and analysis. Dr. W. F. Thompson, until he came to this Commission, had been Scientific Director of the International Fisheries Commission
(Halibut) and was largely responsible for the accomplishments of

59 STAT. ] CANADA- SOCKEYE SALMON FISHERIES-July 21, 1944 Aug. 5, 1944

that Commission which have justly won world-wide recognition. He is now the Scientific Consultant for this Commission.
When the Commission became convinced that a basic difficulty in rehabilitating the Fraser sockeye salmon run lay at Hell's Gate Canyon, it not only concentrated its biological work to bear upon that point but also engaged the most experienced fishery engineers available. Milo Bell, the Commission's chief engineer, is the only active engineer in either nation who has specialized in fishery conservation devices directly related to Pacific salmon. And he in turn has had the assistance of Professor Charles W. Harris, an outstanding hydraulic engineer, as consultant.
So-called fish-ladders have been in use for many years as a means of enabling fish to ascend rivers blocked by dams and natural obstructions . The greatest installation heretofore made was at the Bonneville Dam on the lower Columbia River. The fishery devices at the Bonneville are said to have cost approximately $7,000,000.00 . Nevertheless , these fully justified the expenditure for they have successfully demonstrated their effectiveness in passing the well known Chinook salmon up the Columbia . The practical use of fishladders is therefore well recognized in the engineering field .
In the engineering report submitted herewith, the use of fish-ladders to obviate the Hell's Gate Canyon obstruction is presented . But although the Fraser salmon run substantially exceeds that of the Columbia both in quantity and value, the cost of the proposed fishladders at Hell's Gate Canyon, together with the estimated cost of investigating and overcoming other obstructions and incidental remedial proposals, all together is less than one-third of the cost of the work at Bonneville.
The Commission therefore requests a total appropriation of $2,000,000, one-half from Canada , one-half from the United States, for the purposes above outlined . One good year's run restored should produce a catch ten times the entire proposed investment. And under continued and adequate regulation and protection , this enormous food resource should become recurrent year after year in perpetuity.
Respectfully submitted, INTERNATIONAL PACIFIC SALMON FISHERIES COMMISSION

As you point out the estimated cost of the works recommended, which was two million dollars , would in accordance with Article III , paragraph 2 of the Convention, be shared equally between the two governments .
The Government of the United States has approved the recommendation of the Commission as set forth in its letter and report of January 11 , 1944, and the accompanying documents including the "General Engineering Report Covering Fraser River Fisheries Projects" and the first Deficiency Appropriation Act, 1944 , approved April 1 , 1944 (Public Law 279 , 78th Congress) , contained the following appropriation: "INTERNATIONAL PACIFIC SALMON FISHERIES COMMISSION

MEMORANDUM
The Government of the United States of America directs the attention of the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands to the proposed agreement under Section 3 (c) of the Lend-Lease Act and in particular to Article IV thereof. Under Article IV this Government will review, from time to time, and particularly at the conclusion of hostilities in Europe, as determined by the President, articles and services set forth in the Schedule annexed to the Agreement in order to determine whether the delivery of such articles or services should be withheld in the national interest of the United States. The reservation made by this Government in Article IV to withhold delivery of articles and services "whenever the President determines that such action is in the national interest" constitutes a broad power to cancel or revoke procurement programs or contracts. It is not possible to predict with precision what occasions or circumstances may arise in the future which may require this Government to withhold delivery. Actual delivery will always be subject to the development of the military situation, and the changing demands of strategy, as well as to economic and financial factors which affect the national interest of this Government .
It is further understood that the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands will be obligated to pay currently for civilian supplies furnished by the combined military authorities under "Plan A" or "Plan A" as modified . Payment will be made in accordance with the arrangements to be made with the governments which have furnished the supplies, and in United States dollars to the extent determined under such arrangements.
It is , of course, understood that in the implementation of the provisions of any lend-lease agreement with the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Government of the United States of America will act in accordance with its Constitutional procedures.

The Netherlands Minister to the Acting Secretary of State NETHERLANDS EMBASSY WASHINGTON, D. C.

MY DEAR MR. SECRETARY:

WASHINGTON, April 30th , 1945.

Several questions of interpretation have arisen with respect to the language of the Agreement between our two Governments under Section 3 (c ) of the Lend-Lease Act. I believe it will be helpful to indicate the understanding which my Government now has with respect to these questions and I would appreciate an expression from you as to whether or not these understandings are correct .
1. It is the understanding of my Government that the Agreement does not apply to arms and munitions , and that arms and munitions now or hereafter provided to my Government will be supplied , on a straight lend-lease basis , under the Agreement of July 8, 1942 between 56 Stat. 1554. our two Governments on the principles applying to mutual aid .
2. We understand that in general it is not the intention of the United States Government to exercise its right under Article V of the 56 Stat. 1555. Agreement between our two Governments dated July 8, 1942 to recapture any articles for which the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands has paid or is to pay the United States Government. If, however, the United States Government should exercise this right with respect to any such articles, appropriate arrangements will be made for repayment to the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands .
3. With reference to the last paragraph of Article III of the Agree- Ante, p. 1628.

ment under Section 3 (c ) of the Lend-Lease Act, it is the understanding of my Government that no articles or services will be transferred or rendered to my Government under that Article unless they have been requisitioned by my Government.

4. In the first paragraph of Article IV of the Agreement under Section 3 (c) of the Lend-Lease Act, it is stated that changes may be made from time to time in the items set forth in the Schedule annexed thereto, by mutual agreement between the United States of America and the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It is our understanding that this language means that not only the items but also the values expressed for each item in the Schedule and the total value expressed for the whole Schedule , may be modified by mutual agreement taking into consideration among other things the supply situation in the United States and the established needs of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.

5. With regard generally to the provisions of the Agreement under Section 3 (c ) of the Lend-Lease Act with reference to risk of loss and transfer, as expressed in Section A of the Schedule annexed to the

Agreement, it is my understanding that a suitable opportunity will be given to representatives of my Government, in accordance with the general procedure of your Government, to inspect articles proposed to be transferred before their transfer.

6. With reference to the provision of the Schedule annexed to the Agreement under Section 3 (c) of the Lend-Lease Act that risk of

1634

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [ 59 STAT.

loss shall pass in accordance with the customary practice of the United

55 Stat. 31. 22 U. S. C., Supp. IV, 88 411-419. Ante, p. 52.

States Government with respect to transfers under the Act of Congress of March 11 , 1941 , it is the understanding of my Government that under the practice referred to risk of loss usually passes when the articles leave the possession of the supplier or are withdrawn from the United States Government stock.

7. With reference to the provision of Section A of the Schedule

annexed to the Agreement under Section 3 (c ) of the Lend-Lease Act

that "those articles which, prior to the end of the periods authorized

by law, shall have been contracted for by the United States Government and shall not have been transferred to the Government of the

Kingdom of the Netherlands as above set forth, shall be deemed to be transferred to the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands

upon the last day of such periods " , it is the understanding of my Government that the term "periods" refers to the period as now pro-

vided for by the last clause of Section 3 ( c) of the Lend-Lease Act, or as such period may hereafter be extended by amendment of that

Act, during which the powers conferred by or pursuant to Section 3

(a) of that Act may be exercised to the extent necessary to carry out a contract or agreement made under Section 3 (c) of that Act.

The Netherlands Minister to the Acting Secretary of State
NETHERLANDS EMBASSY WASHINGTON, D. C.

SIR,

WASHINGTON, April 30th, 1945.

In the United Nations declaration of January 1 , 1942, the contract-

ing governments pledged themselves to employ their full resources, military and economic, against those nations with which they are at war ; and in the Agreement of July 8 , 1942 between the Government of the United States and the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands on the Principles Applying to Mutual Aid in the Prosecution of the War Against Aggression each contracting government undertook to provide the other with such articles , services , facilities or information useful in the prosecution of their common war undertaking as it might be in a position to supply. It is the understanding of the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands that the general principle to be followed in providing mutual aid as set forth in the said Agreement of July 8, 1942 is that the war production and the war resources of both nations should be used by each in ways which most effectively utilize the available materials, manpower, production facilities and shipping

space.

With a view, therefore , to supplementing the Agreement of July

8, 1942 , I have the honor to set forth below the understanding of the

Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands of the principles and procedures applicable to the provision of aid by the Government of

the Kingdom of the Netherlands to the armed forces of the United States and in the manner in which such aid will be correlated with the

maintenance of such forces by the United States Government .

1. The Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, retaining

the right of final decision in each case in the light of its own potential-

ities and responsibilities , will provide the United States or its armed

forces with the following types of assistance as reciprocal aid when and

to the extent that it is found that they can most effectively be procured in the territory of the Kingdom of the Netherlands :

55 Stat. 1600. 56 Stat. 1554.
56 Stat. 1554.

(a) Military equipment, munitions and military and naval stores ; (b) Other supplies, materials , facilities, services and information for the United States forces including payment of those civil claims against the United States and its armed forces, employees and officers that shall be mutually agreed upon by the two Governments as a proper charge against the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, but not including the pay and allowances of United States forces, the wages and salaries of civilian officials of the United
States Government and the administrative expenses of United States missions ;
(c) Supplies, materials , facilities , services and information needed in the construction of military projects, tasks and similar capital works required for the common war effort in the territory of the Kingdom of the Netherlands , except for the wages and salaries of United States citizens ;

1636

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [ 59 STAT.

(d) Supplies , materials , facilities , services and information needed in the construction of such military projects tasks and capital works in territory other than territory of the Kingdom of the Netherlands or territory of the United States to the extent that territory of the Kingdom of the Netherlands is a more practicable source of supply than the United States or another of the United Nations ;
(e) Such other supplies, materials, facilities, services and information as may be agreed upon as necessary in the prosecution of the war.

2. The practical application of the principles formulated in this note, including the procedure by which requests for aid are made and acted upon, shall be worked out as occasion may require by agreement between the two governments, acting when possible through their appropriate military or civilian administrative authorities . Requests by the United States Government for such aid will be presented by duly authorized authorities of the United States to official agencies of the Government of the Netherlands which will be designated or established by the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands for the purpose of facilitating the provision of reciprocal aid.

56 Stat. 1555.

3. It is the understanding of the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands that all such aid, as well as other aid , including information. received under Article VI of the Agreement of July 8 , 1942 ,

accepted by the President of the United States or his authorized

representatives from the Government of the Kingdom of the Nether-

55 Stat. 31. 22 U. S. C., Supp. IV, §§ 411-419. Ante, p. 52.

lands will be received as a benefit to the United States under the Act of March 11 , 1941. In so far as circumstances will permit, appropriate record of aid received under this arrangement will be kept by each Government.

57 Stat. 991.

4. In order to facilitate the procurement in the territory of the Kingdom of the Netherlands of supplies , materials , facilities, information and services described in Section 1 , by permitting their direct purchase rather than their procurement by the methods contemplated in Section 2 , during the period of military operations and until such time as the official agencies of the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands are able to provide such reciprocal aid in the manner contemplated in Section 2 , the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands agrees to make available to designated officers of the United States Government such Netherlands currency or credits as may be needed for the purpose. The necessary arrangements will be made by the appropriate authorities of the two governments.
If the Government of the United States concurs in the foregoing, I would suggest that the present note and your reply to that effect be regarded as placing on record the understanding of our two Governments in this matter and as superseding the exchange of notes of June 14 , 1943 on this subject, and that for clarity and convenience of administration the present note and your reply be made retroactive

MY DEAR MR. MINISTER:

April 30, 1945

By the Agreement under Section 3 (c) of the Lend-Lease Act signed today between the Government of the United States of America and

1638 Ante, p. 1627.

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [ 59 STAT.

the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Government of the United States has undertaken, on the terms and subject to the conditions therein stated , to make aid available under the Lend- Lease

Act to the Kingdom of the Netherlands . By the Reciprocal Aid Agreement also entered into today between our two Governments , your Government has undertaken to render reciprocal aid from the territory of the Kingdom of the Netherlands , including the Netherlands East Indies . It is the understanding of both Governments that this

reciprocal aid will include mutually agreed upon quantities of raw materials from the Netherlands East Indies for the use of the United

States military or naval forces or for war production in the United States.

The articles and services now specifically covered by the Agreement under Section 3 (c) of the Lend-Lease Act are those listed in the Schedule annexed to the Agreement. These are for Metropolitan Netherlands only. Article IV of the Agreement, however, provides that changes may be made in that Schedule by mutual agreement between the two Governments, and my Government is prepared in the light of the military situation and its developments to consider changes under that Article with a view to providing essential supplies, of the general type of those listed in the Schedule, necessary for the prosecution of the combined war effort in the Pacific. Any articles and services agreed upon between our two Governments as aid to be so furnished for the Netherlands East Indies under the Agreement will, when so agreed upon, become additions to the Schedule and will be transferred by the Government of the United States of America and accepted by the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands for the Netherlands East Indies, subject to the terms of the Agreement.
It is not the intention of this Government to provide to the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands under the 3 (c) Agreement articles having a long production cycle and a long life.
Sincerely yours, JOSEPH C. GREW

MY DEAR MR. SECRETARY :

WASHINGTON, April 30th, 1945.

Some questions of interpretation have arisen with respect to the language of my note to you dated April 30, 1945 , setting forth the understanding of the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands of the principles and procedures applicable to the provision of aid by the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands to the armed forces of the United States. I am, therefore, giving you the interpretation placed by my Government on those questions, and I would appreciate an expression from you whether or not you agree to these interpretations :
1. The Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, taking into consideration its own potentialities and responsibilities, retains the final decision as to the scope, extent and duration of its provision of aid to the armed forces of the United States .

2. As regards services and supplies procured by the armed forces of the United States either by direct requisition or by use of the funds

or credits made available under the terms of Section 4 of my note, the

Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands retains the right of

deciding whether or not they can be provided as reverse lend -lease.

Finally, I want to state that although the Government of the King-

dom of the Netherlands is fully prepared to give reciprocal aid up to

the limits of its possibilities, the extent of reciprocal aid will necessarily depend on the economic situation of the Kingdom of the Netherlands

after its liberation from enemy occupation, on the flow of imported

supplies and on the development of its foreign exchange position. Sincerely yours, W. v. BOETZELAER.

DEPARTMENT OF STATE WASHINGTON

MY DEAR MR. MINISTER:

April 30, 1945

You will recall that on June 14, 1943 , Dean Acheson, Assistant

Secretary of State, addressed a letter to the Ambassador of the

Kingdom of the Netherlands with respect to the receipt by this Govern-

ment as reciprocal aid of articles previously purchased abroad and

imported into territories of the Kingdom of the Netherlands . In this letter Mr. Acheson stated that this Government does not expect the

Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands or the authorities in its territories to furnish such articles to American forces as reciprocal

aid and that, if such articles were furnished as reciprocal aid in

emergency situations, this Government would be entirely agreeable

to the principle that they should be replaced from the United States as soon as possible. Mr. Acheson further stated that American forces

would not request or accept as reciprocal aid any such articles, the

replacement of which was regarded by the Government of the King-

dom of the Netherlands as desirable, without specific authorization in each case from the War Department.

The exigencies of war has made strict compliance with this procedure

impractical, and your Government has furnished such articles to this Government and its armed forces without compliance with this pro-

cedure. The quantity and value of the articles so furnished are not

yet known and it is anticipated that considerable time may be required before mutual agreement can be reached as to the exact value of the

articles to be replaced under the terms of Mr. Acheson's letter . At the time of Mr. Acheson's letter no non-military supplies were

being provided by my Government to your Government as straight lend-lease. Now, however, our two Governments have concluded an agreement under Section 3 (c) of the Lend-Lease Act, under which this Government will furnish non-military supplies as straight lend-lease aid to your Government to the extent provided therein.

59 STAT. ] NETHERLANDS - MUTUAL AID-APR. 30, 1945

1641

I should therefore like to propose that the obligation in Mr. Ache-

son's letter to replace articles provided as reciprocal aid which have previously been purchased abroad and imported into territories of the

Kingdom of the Netherlands should not apply to articles hereafter made available to this Government as reciprocal aid.

With respect to such articles transferred as reciprocal aid by the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands to the United States

or its armed forces prior to the date of the signing of the Agreement under Section 3 (c) of the Lend-Lease Act, I should like to propose

that final action with respect to replacement be deferred until the

final determination of the terms and conditions upon which mutual

aid has been provided and received by the two Governments in ac-

cordance with the terms of the Agreement of July 8, 1942 , with respect to the principles applying to mutual aid . At the time such a final determination is reached , and the full extent of the aid furnished by the United States and the reciprocal aid furnished by the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands becomes known, the United States

will make such replacement in accordance with the principles ex-

pressed in Mr. Acheson's letter to any extent then mutually agreed

upon between the two Governments as just and equitable.

MEMORANDUM OF INTERPRETATION

with respect to the AGREEMENT between the United States of America and Belgium under
Section 3 (c ) of the Lend-Lease Act
The Government of the United States of America directs the attention of the Government of Belgium to the proposed agreement under Section 3 (c ) of the Lend -Lease Act and in particular to Article IV thereof. Under Article IV this Government will review, from time to time, and particularly at the conclusion of hostilities in Europe, as determined by the President, articles and services set forth in the Schedule annexed to the Agreement in order to determine whether the delivery of such articles or services should be withheld in the national interest of the United States. The reservation made by this Government in Article IV to withhold delivery of articles and services "whenever the President determines that such action is in the national interest " constitutes a broad power to cancel or revoke procurement programs or contracts. It is not possible to predict with precision what occasions or circumstances may arise in the future which may require this Government to withhold delivery. Actual delivery will always be subject to the development of the military situation , and the changing demands of strategy, as well as to economic and financial factors which affect the national interest of this Government.
The Government of the United States of America expects that all articles and services transferred to the Government of Belgium on or before February 28 , 1945 , pursuant to the exchange of notes between the Foreign Economic Administration and the Belgian Ambassador to the United States on October 20 and October 25 , 1944, [ 1 ] will be paid for in United States dollars in accordance with the terms of those notes and any articles and services requisitioned in accordance with the provisions of those notes but transferred after February 28, 1945 will be regarded , if appropriate, as deliveries under the Schedule annexed to the Agreement.
The Government of the United States of America further wishes
to point out that, in view of the existing economic and governmental relationships and arrangements between the Government of Belgium and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, and the fact that the Government of Belgium and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg are employing their resources together in the prosecution of the war against the common enemy, it is understood that some of the articles, or an appropriate portion thereof, delivered under this Agreement are required for use or consumption within the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, and that the Government of Belgium and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg will make such arrangements between them as may be needed to effectuate such use or consumption within the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. The Government of the United States of America therefore consents to the transfer by the Government of Belgium of

such articles, or an appropriate portion thereof, to the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.

It is further understood that the Government of Belgium will be

obligated to pay currently for civilian supplies furnished by the com-

bined military authorities under "Plan A " or " Plan A" as modified.

Payment will be made in accordance with the arrangements to be made

with the governments which have furnished the supplies, and in United States dollars to the extent determined under such arrangements.

It is, of course, understood that in the implementation of the pro-

visions of any lend-lease agreement with the Government of Belgium, the Government of the United States of America will act in accordance

with its Constitutional procedures.

SIR :

WASHINGTON, April 17, 1945.

55 Stat. 32. 22 U. S. C., Supp. IV, § 412 (c). Ante, p. 52.

Several questions of interpretation have arisen with respect to the language of the Agreement between our two Governments under Section 3 ( c) of the Lend Lease Act . I believe it will be helpful to indicate the understanding which my Government now has with respect

to these questions and I would appreciate an expression from you as

to whether or not these understandings are correct.

56 Stat. 1504. 56 Stat. 1505.

1. It is the understanding of my Government that the Agreement does not apply to arms and munitions, and that arms and munitions now or hereafter provided to my Government will be supplied, on a straight lend lease basis, under the Agreement of June 16 , 1942 between our two Governments on the principles applying to mutual aid.
2. We understand that in general it is not the intention of the United States Government to exercise its right under Article V of the Agree-

Ante, p. 1643.

ment between our two Governments dated June 16, 1942 to recapture any articles for which the Government of Belgium has paid or is to pay the United States Government. If however, the United States Government should exercise this right with respect to any such articles, appropriate arrangements will be made for repayment to the Government of Belgium.
3. With reference to the last paragraph of Article III of the Agreement under Section 3 ( c ) of the Lend Lease Act, it is the understanding of my Government that no articles or services will be transferred or

Ante, p. 1643.

rendered to my Government under that Article unless they have been requisitioned by my Government.
4. In the first paragraph of Article IV of the Agreement under Section 3 (c ) of the Lend Lease Act, it is stated that changes may be made from time to time in the items set forth in the Schedule annexed

59 STAT. ]

April 17, 19, 1945
BELGIUM-MUTUAL AIDMay 19, 1945

1649

thereto, by mutual agreement between the United States of America and the Government of Belgium. It is our understanding that this language means that not only the items but also the values expressed for each item in the Schedule and the total value expressed for the whole Schedule, may be modified by mutual agreement.
5. With regard generally to the provisions of the Agreement under Section 3 (c ) of the Lend Lease Act with reference to risk of loss and transfer, as expressed in Section A of the Schedule annexed to the

Ante, p. 1644.

Agreement, it is my understanding that a suitable opportunity will be given to representatives of my Government, in accordance with the general procedures of your Government, to inspect articles proposed to be transferred before their transfer.

6. With reference to the provision of the Schedule annexed to the Agreement under Section 3 (c ) of the Lend Lease Act that risk of

loss shall pass in accordance with the customary practice of the

United States Government with respect to transfers under the Act of Congress of March 11, 1941 , it is the understanding of my Government that under the practice referred to risk of loss usually passes when the articles leave the possession of the supplier or are withdrawn

55 Stat. 31. 22 U. S. C., Supp.
IVA.nt$e5,4p1.1-5421. 9.

from United States Government stock.

7. With reference to the provision of Section A of the Schedule annexed to the Agreement under Section 3 (c) of the Lend Lease Act that "those articles which, prior to the end of the periods authorized by law, shall have been contracted for by the United States Government and shall not have been transferred to the Government of Belgium as above set forth, shall be deemed to be transferred to the Government of Belgium upon the last day of such periods", it is the understanding of my Government that the term " periods" refers to the period as now provided for by the last clause of section 3 ( c ) of the Lend Lease Act, or as such period may hereafter be extended by amendment of that Act, during which the powers conferred by or pursuant to Section 3 (a ) of that Act may be exercised to the extent necessary to carry out a contract or agreement made under Section 3 ( c) of that Act.

I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the

assurances of my highest consideration.

IV, § 412 (c). Ante, p. 52.

In the Memorandum of Interpretation accompanying the Agreement under Section 3 (c) of the Lend-Lease Act which was signed by our Governments today, there is set forth the understanding of my Government that some of the articles to be delivered under the Agree-

ment will be required for use or consumption within the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and that the Government of Belgium and the Government of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg will make the necessary

arrangements to effectuate such use or consumption within the Grand

Duchy of Luxembourg.

You will understand that if my Government should not be able to

conclude arrangements with the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg required by the Lend-Lease Act, my Government's consent to future retransfers

to the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, as expressed in the Memorandum accompanying the 3 (c) Agreement, will have to be qualified or revoked .

WASHINGTON, April 19th , 1945

MY DEAR MR. SECRETARY :

With reference to the Schedule attached to the Agreement between the United States of America and Belgium, under Section 3 ( c ) of the Lend-Lease Act, I note that the amount of $42,000,000.00 has been set for freight charges on American ocean vessels.

59 STAT. ]

BELGIUM--MUTUAL AID -- April 17, 19 , 1945 May 19, 1945

1651

After discussion of this matter with the experts of the "Mission Economique Belge", I feel that due to the fact that an important part of the supplies from United States to Belgium will be shipped on vessels that are not under American Registry, the amount of $42,000,000. seems far in excess of the freight payments which could possibly be made for transport on American ocean vessels .
Under Article IV of said Agreement, changes may be made from time to time in the items set forth in the Schedule annexed thereto. However, in connection with the conclusion of the Agreement, I should like to state, for the record , that if in the near future the estimate of the experts of the " Mission Economique Belge" proves to be correct, I will request a transfer of part of this amount to other items of the schedule.

MY DEAR MR. SECRETARY,

to obtain the benefit of the provisions relating to price determination as embodied in such an Agreement . I should be grateful if you would kindly confirm that this is also the understanding of your Government.

MY DEAR MR. AMBASSADOR :

I acknowledge the receipt of your letter of April 19, 1945 in which

you state that in respect to the price arrangements contained in paragraph B of the Schedule attached to the Lend-Lease Agreement of April 17, 1945 between the United States and Belgium, your Government would expect to obtain the benefit of comparable price provisions contained in a similar Agreement between the United States and any other country.

The Government of the United States has the intention of treating

each country in its individual relationship with the United States

fairly and equitably in all matters pertaining to lend -lease and the

general procurement of supplies in the United States. However, the

United States does not consider it necessary that comparable arrange-

ments in similar agreements between the United States and any other country should contain identical or equally favorable provisions. It is

sufficient that the individual lend-lease arrangements established be-

tween the United States and each country shall be reasonable. The relatively temporary character of lend -lease, the numerous and dis-

similar factors involved in the lend -lease relationships of the United

States and the rapidly changing war situation compel this Government to retain freedom of action in negotiating individual lend- lease

agreements . Sincerely yours,

AMBASSADE DE BELGIQUE

WASHINGTON, April 17, 1945.

SIR :

In the United Nations declaration of January 1 , 1942 , the contracting governments pledged themselves to employ their full resources, military and economic, against those nations with which they are at war ; and in the Agreement of June 16, 1942, each contracting government undertook to provide the other with such articles , services, facilities or information useful in the prosecution of their common war undertaking as each may be in a position to supply. It is further the understanding of the Government of Belgium that the general principle to be followed in providing mutual aid as set forth in the said Agreement of June 16, 1942, is that the war production and the war

59 STAT. ]

April 17, 19, 1945 BELGIUM- MUTUAL AID-
May 19, 1945

1653

resources of both Nations should be used by the armed forces of each and of the other United Nations in ways which most effectively utilize the available materials, manpower, production facilities and shipping space.
With a view, therefore, to supplementing Article II and Article VI of the Agreement of June 16, 1942 , between our two Governments for the provision of reciprocal aid, I have the honor to set forth the understanding of the Government of Belgium of the principles and procedures applicable to the provision of aid by the Government of Belgium to the armed forces of the United States and the manner in which such aid will be correlated with the maintenance of such forces by the United States Government.
1. The Government of Belgium , retaining the right of final decision in each case in the light of its own potentialities and responsibilities, will provide the United States or its armed forces with the following types of assistance as reciprocal aid when and to the extent that it is found that they can most effectively be procured in Belgium or the Belgian Congo :
(a ) Military equipment, munitions and military and naval stores ;
(b ) Other supplies, materials, facilities, services and information for the United States forces including payment of those civil claims against the United States and its armed forces , employees and officers that shall be mutually agreed upon by the two Governments as a proper charge against the Belgian Government, but not including the pay and allowances of United forces, the wages and salaries of civilian officials of the United States Government and the administrative expenses of United States missions ;
(c) Supplies, materials and services needed in the construction of military projects, tasks and similar capital works required for the common war effort in Belgium or the Belgian Congo, except for the wages and salaries of United States citizens ;
(d ) Supplies, materials and services needed in the construction of such military projects, tasks and capital works in territory other than Belgium or the Belgian Congo or territory of the United States to the extent that Belgium or the Belgian Congo is a more practicable source of supply than the United States or another of the United Nations ;
( e) Such other supplies, materials, facilities, services and information as may be agreed upon as necessary in the prosecution of the war.

56 Stat. 1505.

2. The practical application of the principles formulated in this note, including the procedure by which requests for aid are made and acted upon, shall be worked out as occasion may require by agreement between the two governments, acting when possible through their appropriate military or civilian administrative authorities. Requests by the United States Government for such aid will be presented by duly authorized authorities of the United States to official agencies of the Belgian Government which will be designated or established

1654

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [59 STAT.

by the Government of Belgium for the purpose of facilitating the

provision of reciprocal aid .

3. It is the understanding of the Government of Belgium that all

56 Stat. 1505.

such aid, as well as other aid, including information received under Article VI of the Agreement of June 16, 1942, accepted by the President of the United States or his authorized representatives from the

55 Stat. 31. 22 U. S. C., Supp.
IV, §§ 411-419. Ante, p. 52.

Government of Belgium will be received as a benefit to the United States under the Act of March 11, 1941. Insofar as circumstances will permit, appropriate record of aid received under this arrangement, except for miscellaneous facilities and services, will be kept by each Government.

4. In order to facilitate the procurement in Belgian metropolitan

territory of supplies, materials, facilities, information and services

described in Section 1, by permitting their direct purchase rather than their procurement by the methode contemplated in Section 2 , during the period of military operations and until such time as the official agencies of the Belgian Government are able to provide such reciprocal aid in the manner contemplated in Section 2 , the Government of Belgium agreed to make available to designated officers of the United States Government such Belgian franc currency or credits

as may be needed for the purpose. The necessary arrangements will be made by the appropriate authorities of the two governments.

57 Stat. 920.

If the Government of the United States concurs in the foregoing,

I would suggest that the present note and your reply to that effect be

regarded as placing on record the understanding of our two govern-

ments in this matter and as superseding the exchange of notes of

January 30, 1943 on this subject, and that for clarity and convenience

of administration the present note and your reply be made retroac-

tive to June 16, 1942, the date of the Agreement of the two Govern-

ments on the principles of mutual aid.

I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Excellency

the assurances of my highest consideration .

The Secretary of State to the Belgian Ambassador
DEPARTMENT OF STATE WASHINGTON
April 17, 1945
MY DEAR MR. AMBASSADOR : You will recall that on January 30 , 1943 Dean Acheson , Assistant
Secretary of State, addressed a letter to the Belgian Ambassador with respect to the receipt by this Government as reciprocal aid of articles previously purchased abroad and imported into Belgian territory. In that letter Mr. Acheson stated that this Government does not expect the Belgian Government or the authorities in the Belgian Congo to furnish such articles to American forces as reciprocal aid and that , if such articles were furnished as reciprocal aid in emergency situations, this Government would be entirely agreeable to the principle that they should be replaced from the United States as soon as possible. Mr. Acheson further stated that American forces would not request or accept as reciprocal aid any such articles, the replacement of which was regarded by the Belgian Government as desirable, without specific authorization in each case from the War Department.
The exigencies of war have made strict compliance with this procedure impractical, and your Government has furnished such articles to this Government and its armed forces without compliance with this procedure. The quantity and value of the articles so furnished are not yet known and it is anticipated that considerable time may be required before mutual agreement can be reached as to the exact value of the articles to be replaced under the terms of Mr. Acheson's letter.
At the time of Mr. Acheson's letter no non -military supplies were being provided by my Government to your Government as straight lend -lease. Now, however, our two Governments have concluded an

1656 56 Stat. 1504.

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [ 59 STAT.
agreement under Section 3 ( c ) of the Lend - Lease Act, under which this Government will furnish non-military supplies as straight lendlease aid to your Government to the extent provided therein.
I should therefore like to propose that the obligation in Mr. Acheson's letter to replace articles provided as reciprocal aid which have previously been purchased abroad and imported into Belgian territory should not apply to articles hereafter made available to this Government as reciprocal aid.
With respect to such articles transferred as reciprocal aid by the Government of Belgium to the United States or its armed forces prior to the date of the signing of the Agreement under Section 3 ( c ) of the Lend-Lease Act, I should like to propose that final action with respect to replacement be deferred until the final determination of the terms and conditions upon which mutual aid has been provided and received by the two Governments in accordance with the terms of the Agreement of June 16 , 1942 with respect to the principles applying to mutual aid. At the time such a final determination is reached , and the full extent of the aid furnished by the United States and the reciprocal aid furnished by the Government of Belgium becomes known, the United States will make such replacement in accordance with the principles expressed in Mr. Acheson's letter to any extent then mutually agreed upon between the two Governments as just and equitable.
Sincerely yours, ER STETTINIUS, Jr
His Excellency Baron ROBERT SILVERCRUYS , Belgian Ambassador.

AMBASSADE DE BELGIQUE D. 8492/9 No. 2368
MY DEAR MR. SECRETARY :

WASHINGTON, April 19, 1945

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated April 17th, 1945, forwarding certain proposals made with reference to

the commitments taken by the United States Government and embodied in Mr. Dean Acheson's letter of January 30th , 1943.

As you will recall, at that time the Belgian Congo was the only territory under Belgian jurisdiction where reciprocal aid could be

made effective. The terms of Mr. Acheson's letter refer accurately

to the situation prevailing in the Belgian Colony, where almost every manufactured article was purchased abroad and imported with considerable difficulty. It was not considered desirable that American

forces should procure such articles without a reasonable assurance

being given that they would be replaced.

Quite different is the situation in the highly industrialized Belgian

59 STAT. ]

April 17, 19, 1945 BELGIUM- MUTUAL AID-
May 19, 1945

metropolitan territory, which is largely dependent on imports of raw materials and where procurement from the almost depleted stocks of locally produced goods would generally necessitate their replacement by importation of the raw materials needed in their manufacture.
In order to deal with this possibility, which in our view amounts to the extension of aid not within the scope of the Reciprocal Aid Agreement between Belgium and the United States, negotiations were undertaken in Washington between the Department of State and the Belgian Embassy. On October 16th , 1944 a draft amendment to the letter of the Belgian Ambassador dated January 30th , 1943 was submitted by the Department of State to the Belgian Embassy. Paragraph III , which was tentatively agreed upon at that time, expressed in the following terms the intentions of the two interested parties concerning the special situation likely to arise in Belgium.
"In view of the shortages prevailing in Belgium, the Government of Belgium regrets that it will not be in a position to provide as reciprocal aid under Section 1 any supplies or materials (except for component parts or component materials ) which require current replacement by purchases involving the use of foreign exchange from sources outside of Belgium or the Belgian Congo. The Government of Belgium, therefore, requests assurances that the Government of the United States will undertake
at its option either to replace or to refund in dollars the cost of any such supplies or materials which have been either requisitioned in the manner contemplated in Section 2 , or purchased with the currency made available under the terms of Section 4 , wherever the quantity involved is appreciable from the point of view of the dollar exchange required for replacements. "
Although no formal agreement was ever concluded on this subject, the Belgian authorities in charge of Reverse Lend -Lease Administration operated on the assumption that such was the understanding and furnished to the Allied Armies supplies, the replacement of which would call for imports from abroad.
While accepting your proposal that final action with respect to replacement be deferred, I wish to place the foregoing on record and to state that the Belgian Government may request that consideration be given to the matters mentioned above, in the final determination of the terms and conditions upon which mutual aid has been provided .
Sincerely yours, The Belgian Ambassador, SILVERCRUYS

The terms of this agreement which you have communicated to me are as follows :
AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND NORWAY RELATING TO AIR TRANSPORT SERVICES

The Governments of the United States of America and Norway signed on October 16, 1933 an air navigation arrangement governing the operation of civil aircraft of the one country in the territory of the other country, in which each party agreed that consent for the operations over its territory by air transport companies of the other party might not be refused on unreasonable or arbitrary grounds. Pursuant to the aforementioned arrangement of 1933, the two governments hereby conclude the following arrangement covering the operation of scheduled airline services between their respective territories, based on the standard form of agreement for air routes and services included in the Final Act of the International Civil Aviation Conference signed at Chicago on December 7, 1944.
ARTICLE 1

The contracting parties grant the rights specified in the Annex hereto necessary for establishing the international civil air routes and

services therein described, whether such services be inaugurated imme-

diately or at a later date at the option of the contracting party to whom

the rights are granted.

ARTICLE 2

(a) Each of the air services so described shall be placed in operation as soon as the contracting party to whom the rights have been granted by Article 1 to designate an airline or airlines for the route concerned has authorized an airline for such route, and the contracting party granting the rights shall , subject to Article 6 hereof, be bound to give the appropriate operating permission to the airline or airlines concerned ; provided that the airlines so designated may be required to qualify before the competent aeronautical authorities of the contracting party granting the rights under the laws and regulations normally applied by these authorities before being permitted to engage in the operations contemplated by this agreement ; and provided that in areas of hostilities or of military occupation, or in areas affected thereby, such inauguration shall be subject to the approval of the competent military authorities.
(b) It is understood that either contracting party granted commercial rights under this agreement should exercise them at the earliest practicable date except in the case of temporary inability to do so.
ARTICLE 3

59 STAT. ] NORWAY-AIR TRANSPORT SERVICES -OCT. 6, 1945

1663

(a) Each of the contracting parties may impose or permit to be imposed just and reasonable charges for the use of public airports and other facilities under its control. Each of the contracting parties agrees, however, that these charges shall not be higher than would be paid for the use of such airports and facilities by its national aircraft engaged in similar international services.
(b ) Fuel, lubricating oils and spare parts introduced into the territory of one contracting party by the other contracting party or its nationals, and intended solely for use by aircraft of such other contracting party shall be accorded national and most-favored-nation treatment with respect to the imposition of customs duties, inspection fees or other national duties or charges by the contracting party whose territory is entered .
(c) The fuel, lubricating oils, spare parts, regular equipment and aircraft stores retained on board civil aircraft of the airlines of one
contracting party authorized to operate the routes and services described in the Annex shall , upon arriving in or leaving the territory of the other contracting party, be exempt from customs, inspection fees or similar duties or charges, even though such supplies be used or consumed by such aircraft on flights in that territory.
ARTICLE 4

Certificates of airworthiness , certificates of competency and licenses issued or rendered valid by one contracting party shall be recognized as valid by the other contracting party for the purpose of operating the routes and services described in the Annex. Each contracting
party reserves the right, however, to refuse to recognize, for the purpose of flight above its own territory, certificates of competency and licenses granted to its own nationals by another state.

Post, p. 1664.

ARTICLE 5

(a ) The laws and regulations of one contracting party relating to the admission to or departure from its territory of aircraft engaged in international air navigation , or to the operation and navigation of such aircraft while within its territory, shall be applied to the aircraft of the other contracting party, and shall be complied with by such aircraft upon entering or departing from or while within the territory of the first party.
(b) The laws and regulations of one contracting party as to the admission to or departure from its territory of passengers, crew, or cargo of aircraft, such as regulations relating to entry, clearance , immigration, passports, customs, and quarantine shall be complied with by or on behalf of such passengers, crew or cargo of the other contracting party upon entrance into or departure from, or while within the territory of the first party.

ARTICLE 6

1664

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [59 STAT.

Ante, p. 52. French supplies and services to U.S.

tain the United States war effort, which the French authorities have

furnished to the United States and will continue to furnish , within

limitations of need and supply, it is understood that :

a) The French authorities undertake to make available to or for the use of the armed forces and other governmental agencies of the United States, as reverse Lend-Lease aid to the United States, on a straight Lend-Lease basis, when it is found that
such aid can most effectively be procured in territory under their control,
(i) military equipment, munitions, and military and naval
stores ; (ii) - other supplies, materials, facilities and services for United
States forces , including the use of railway and port
facilities, but not including the pay and allowances of such forces nor the administrative expenses of American missions ; (iii) - supplies , materials , facilities and services, except for the wages and salaries of United States citizens , needed in the construction of military projects, tasks and similar capital works required in the common war effort, to the extent that French North or West Africa is the most practicable
source of such supplies , materials, facilities or services ; (iv) - such other supplies, materials , services or facilities as may
be agreed upon as necessary in the prosecution of the war , but not including exports of civilian supplies to the United States from North and West Africa.

While the French authorities retain, of course , the right of final decision , subject to the obligations and arrangements they have entered into for the prosecution of the war, decisions as to the most effective use of resources shall, so far as possible, be made in common, pursuant to common plans for winning the war. b) All civilian supplies exported from French North and West Africa to the United States will be paid for on the basis of prices to be agreed .

to establish organizations for facilitating the transfer of reciprocal aid.
e) For use in those exceptional cases , and particularly in cases of local procurement of supplies, in which it is agreed to be more practicable to secure such reverse Lend-Lease supplies , facilities and services by direct purchase , rather than by the method of procurement set forth in Paragraph II (b) , it is agreed that the French authorities establish a franc account in convenient banking institutions and in the name of a designated officer of the United States to facilitate the provision of reverse LendLease aid as contemplated by Paragraph II (a) . The French contributions to this account will be mutually agreed upon from time to time in the light of the changing needs of the American forces, and other appropriate factors . Such an account will not be used for the payment of wages and salaries of American military or civilian personnel , nor for administrative expenses of American missions . Estimates of the franc requirements of the United States will be submitted to designated French authorities from time to time, as may be found convenient . The French authorities will be kept fully and currently informed of all transactions in this account.

III - In exceptional cases, and when they deem it preferable , the American military forces, or other agencies of the United States Government, may continue to use their present practice of acquiring francs against dollars from the French authorities. Iv - Adequate statistical records will be kept of all goods and services exchanged as mutual aid under paragraphs I and II above. V - The provisions of this modus vivendi correspond to a desire to reduce to an appropriate minimum the need of either party for currency of the other party. Provisions which call for payments in dollars have been decided upon in view of the special situation arising from accumulated dollar balances and availabilities of dollar funds due to the presence of United States troops in French North and West Africa. Revision of the payment provisions of this modus vivendi will be made should the situation require.

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [59 STAT.

Le Comité Français de la Libération Nationale et le Gouvernement des Etats-Unis, désireux de se prêter mutuellement l'aide réciproque nécessaire à la poursuite de leur effort de guerre commun, sont convenus du présent modus vivendi provisoire qui sera applicable, dès sa signature, en Afrique du Nord et en Afrique Occidentale Françaises .
1º - Les Etats-Unis ont fourni et continueront à fournir aux autorités françaises, dans la limite des besoins et des disponibilités , le matériel et les services qui leur seraient indiepensables pour soutenir l'effort de guerre français, dans les conditions ci-dessous définies:

Cette aide ne comprend pas la solde et les indemnités des troupes françaises . Les Etats-Unis se réservent le droit de demander la restitution de tous les articles livrés en vertu du présent paragraphe, qui n'auront pas été perdus , détériorés ou consommés :
i) s'il est convenu à tout moment que cette restitution est avantageuse à la conduite de la guerre; ou bien:

Le paiement en sera fait au fur et à mesure, à des intervalles convenables, en dollars, à un compte à désigner à cet effet aux Etats-Unis .
c) La distinction entre le caractère civil ou militaire de l'aide, des services ou des fournitures sera faite d'un commun accord , chaque fois qu'il sera nécessaire .
d) Toute aide fournie en vertu des paragraphes 1 (a) et 1 (b ) sera accordée par les Etats-Unis en vertu de l'acte du Congrès du 11 Mars 1941 (modifié) et selon les termes et conditions qui y sont stipulés .
2° - Les Autorités françaises ont fourni et continueront à fournir aux Etats-Unis, dans la limite des besoins et disponibilités, les marchandises et les services qui leur seraient indispensables pour soutenir l'effort de guerre, dans les conditions ci-dessous définies:

59 STAT. ] FRENCH COMMITTEE-MUTUAL AID- SEPT. 25, 1943
a) Les Autorités françaises s'engagent à mettre à la disposition des Forces armées et autres organismes gouvernementaux des Etats-Unis , à titre d'aide réciproque, sur une base purement prêt-bail , lorsqu'il apparaîtra que cette aide peut être obtenue de la manière la plus pratique dans les territoires sous leur contrôle :
1º - du matériel militaire, des munitions , des approvisionnements militaires et navals ;
2º - les autres fournitures, marchandises, facilités et services à l'usage des Forces armées américaines, y compris l'utilisation des chemins de fer et installations portuaires, sans toutefois prendre à leur charge les soldes et indemnités de ces Forces. et les dépenses administratives des Missions américaines ;
3° - les fournitures, marchandises , facilités et services , sans toutefois prendre à leur charge les gages et soldes des citoyens américains , nécessaires pour la réalisation matérielle des projets et autres travaux militaires importants nécessaires en vue de poursuivre l'effort de guerre commun , dans la mesure où l'Afrique du Nord et l'A.O.F. sont la source la plus commode pour obtenir ces fournitures, marchandises , services ou facilités ;
4° les autres fournitures, marchandises , services ou facilités qui
seront reconnus comme nécessaires pour la conduite de la guerre, à l'exception des fournitures civiles exportées de l'Afrique du Nord ou de l'A.O.F . vers les Etats-Unis.
Quoique les autorités françaises conservent, bien entendu, le droit de décision finale, sous réserve des obligations et conventions qu'elles ont contractées pour la poursuite de la guerre, les décisions relatives à l'emploi le plus efficace des ressources seront, dans la mesure du possible , prises en commun, conformément au plan commun pour gagner la guerre.
b) Les fournitures civiles exportées de l'Afrique du Nord et de l'A.O.F. vers les Etats-Unis seront payées à des prix convenus d'un commun accord, le paiement en étant fait par les Autorités américaines aux Autorités françaises, en dollars , périodiquement, à un compte à désigner aux Etats-Unis.
c) La distinction entre le caractère civil ou militaire de l'aide , des services ou des fournitures , sera faite d'un commun accord et chaque fois qu'il sera nécessaire.
d) Pour obtenir les fournitures et services rentrant dans le cadre du paragraphe 2 (a) les officiers ou les fonctionnaires américains dûment habilités adresseront leur demande aux Services officiels
dûment désignés par les autorités françaises . Ces services seront institués à Alger, Casablanca , Oran, Tunis, Dakar et autres endroits où il sera jugé utile et possible de mettre sur pied des organismes destinés à faciliter l'échange de l'aide réciproque .
e) A titre exceptionnel, particulièrement dans le cas d'achats locaux de fournitures , lorsqu'il sera reconnu préférable d'un commun accord que les Services compétents du Gouvernement des Etats-Unis se

1671

1672

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [59 STAT.

procurent au titre Prêt-Bail des fournitures , ainsi que des facilités et services par voie d'achats directs , plutôt que par la méthode décrite au paragraphe 2 (a) , les Autorités françaises ouvriront un comptefrancs dans les Etablissements bancaires au nom d'un officier des

Etats-Unis désigné à cet effet, pour faciliter le fonctionnement de l'aide réciproque comme prévu au paragraphe 2 (a ) . Les versements français à ce compte seront fixés d'un commun accord , compte tenu des besoins des Forces américaines et autres facteurs à prendre en considération . Ce compte ne sera pas utilisé pour le règlement des gages et salaires du personnel américain civil et militaire, ni pour les dépenses administratives des missions américaines . Les estimations des besoins en francs des Etats-Unis seront soumises périodiquement aux autorités françaises compétentes ; les autorités françaises seront tenues au courant, d'une manière complète et régulière , de toutes les dépenses faites sur ce compte.

3º - A titre exceptionnel, et lorsqu'elles l'estimeront préférable, les Forces armées américaines ou autres services du Gouvernement des Etats-Unis pourront, comme ils le font actuellement, acheter aux autorités françaises des francs contre des dollars.
4º - Il sera tenu une statistique adéquate de toutes les fournitures et services échangés à titre d'aide réciproque, conformément aux paragraphes 1 et 2 ci-dessus.
5° - Les clauses du présent modus vivendi répondent à l'intention de réduire à un minimum approprié les besoins de chacune des deux parties dans la monnaie de l'autre.
Les clauses qui se traduisent par des paiements en dollars ont été prises compte tenu de la situation particulière résultant des soldes et des disponibilités en dollars qui ont été accumulées par suite de la présence des troupes américaines en Afrique du Nord et en A. O. F.; les clauses de paiement seront révisées si la situation le rend nécessaire.

SANTIAGO, May 11, 1943

MR. AMBASSADOR :
I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your courteous communication No. 2021 , dated the fifth instant, by which Your Excellency proposes to the Government of Chile the carrying out of a cooperative program of health and sanitation, for which the United States Government would contribute, through the Office of the Coordinator of Inter- American Affairs, up to the sum of five million dollars (U.S. $ 5,000,000) and the cooperation of such experts as may be deemed necessary .

59 STAT. ]

CHILE-HEALTH AND SANITATION PROGRAM-- MAY 5, 11, 1943 1681

The undersigned Minister appreciates and accepts the cooperation offered, with the understanding that the details of this general proposal will be the subject of agreements between the appropriate official of the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs and the Director General of Health, in his capacity as representative of the National Health Service of Chile, on whom it is incumbent, in accordance with our legislation, to propose to the Government the manner of solving our health problems and to carry out the corresponding works .
As a matter of fact , the political Constitution entrusts to the National Health Service the care of the public health and sanitary welfare of the country, and the Sanitary Code provides , in Article 4 , that this Service shall be under the Director General of Health, who will exercise his functions in accordance with the powers and duties which the laws assign to him, to the exclusion of any other authority .
Furthermore, the same Code, in its Article 269 , authorizes this Service to receive and administer donations with the object of applying them to public health purposes .
As Your Excellency states , all the projects completed in the execution of this program shall be the property of the Government of Chile.
Consequently, I beg to ask that Your Excellency be so kind as to inform the representative of the Office of the Coordinator of InterAmerican Affairs that he may deal with the Director General of Health, who has the necessary capacity to conclude agreements with respect to procedure and other details connected with the prosecution of the cooperative program of health and sanitation and to the investment of the funds in question, with the understanding that the Supreme Government will approve his acts.
The Supreme Government will provide the necessary facilities for the organization of the special Department in the National Health Service, to which Your Excellency refers, and will also contribute an amount to be determined in due course for financing such plan of sanitation works as may be agreed upon.
Finally, the undersigned begs to suggest to Your Excellency the desirability of indicating to this Ministry the name of the official who would represent the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs and the powers with which he will act for the desired purposes.
I avail myself of the present opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the assurances of my highest and most distinguished consideration.

No. 2719 SIR :

EMBASSY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
London, June 10, 1943.

I have the honor to refer to the arrangement made between the

Government of the United Kingdom and the Government of the United States by which, in conformity with the provisions of Public Law 704 enacted by the Seventy-seventh Congress of the United States and ap-

56 Stat. 746. 34 U. 8. C., Supp.

proved August 18, 1942 , [ 1 ] the courts of the United States were per-

mitted to exercise jurisdiction over prizes taken by United States armed

forces and brought into the territorial waters of the United Kingdom

and Sierra Leone. A copy of the Act in question is enclosed for your

convenient reference. The consent of the Government of the

United Kingdom to this arrangement was notified to this Embassy by a note ( No. W 13225/279/49 ) dated November 3, 1942. [ 2 ]
My Government now desires to obtain the consent of the Government of India to a similar arrangement with respect to prizes taken by United States armed forces and brought into the territorial juris-

diction of the Government of India. Permission is desired for special prize commissioners appointed by the district courts of the United States to exercise in India such powers and duties, in addition to those already prescribed for prize commissioners, as may be deemed necessary or proper for carrying out the purposes of Public Law 704. The

duties of prize commissioners are set out in Title 34 , U.S.C. , Section 1138, which reads as follows :

"S 1138. Duties of prize commissioners. The prize commissioners, or one of them, shall receive from the prize master the documents and papers, and inventory thereof, and shall take the affidavit of the prize master required by section 1134 of this title, and shall forthwith take the testimony of the witnesses sent in,
separate from each other, on interrogatories prescribed by the court, in the manner usual in prize courts ; and the witnesses shall not be permitted to see the interrogatories, documents, or
papers , or to consult with counsel , or with any persons interested 1

without special authority from the court ; and witnesses who have the rights of neutrals shall be discharged as soon as practicable. The prize commissioners shall also take depositions de bene esse of the prize crew and others, at the request of the district attorney, on interrogatories prescribed by the court. They shall also, as soon as any prize property comes within the district for adjudication, examine the same , and make an inventory thereof, founded on an actual examination, and report to the court whether any part of it is in a condition requiring immediate sale for the interests of all parties, and notify the district attorney thereof ; and if it be necessary to the examination or making of the inventory that the cargo be unladen , they shall apply to the court for an order to the marshal to unlade the same, and shall , from
time to time, report to the court anything relating to the condition of the property, or its custody or disposal , which may require any action by the court, but the custody of the property shall be in the marshal only. They shall also seasonably return into court, sealed and secured from inspection, the documents and papers which shall come to their hands, duly scheduled and numbered, and the other preparatory evidence, and the evidence taken de bene esse, and their own inventory of the prize property ; and if the captured vessel, or any of its cargo or stores, are such as in their judgment may be useful to the United States in war, they shall report the same to the Secretary of the Navy." 56 Stat. 746, 747. 34 U. S. C., Supp. My Government, upon the receipt from the Government of India IV, §§ 1161 , 1165. of the consent required by Section 3 of Public Law 704, will take appropriate measures in accordance with Section 7 of the same Act to confer reciprocal privileges upon the Government of India with respect to prizes. I shall be grateful if you will inform the Government of India of my Government's desire and request, on my Government's behalf, the necessary consent to the exercise of such powers by United States courts and by special prize commissioners appointed by them within the territorial jurisdiction of the Government of India Accept, Sir, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration .

The Governments whose duly authorised representatives have signed the present Agreement
Have agreed as follows :-
ARTICLE I
There is hereby established the European Central Inland Transport Organisation, hereinafter called "the Organisation," which shall act in accordance with the provisions of the following Articles. The Organisation is established as a co-ordinating and consultative organ. Having regard to the successful completion of the war, it shall coordinate efforts to utilise all means of transport for the improvement of communications so as to provide for the restoration of normal conditions of economic life. It shall also provide assistance to the Allied Commanders-in-Chief and to the Occupation Authorities set up by Governments of the United Nations to maintain and improve the carrying capacity of transport.
ARTICLE II. - Membership.
The members of the Organisation shall be the Governments signatory hereto and such other Governments as may be admitted thereto by the Council.
ARTICLE III. - Constitution.
1. The Organisation shall consist of a Council and an Executive Board with the necessary headquarters, regional and local staff. The

59 STAT. ] MULTILATERAL-TRANSPORT ORGANIZATION- SEPT. 27, 1945
Organisation shall concert arrangements for the establishment of regional and local offices with the Member Governments in whose territory the offices are situated and/or in appropriate cases in agreement with the Allied Commander-in-Chief concerned .
The Council.
2. Each member Government shall name one representative and such alternates as may be necessary upon the Council. The Council shall, for each of its sessions, select one of its members to preside. The Council shall determine its own rules of procedure. Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement or by action of the Council , the Council shall vote by simple majority.
3. The Council shall be convened in regular session not less than twice a year by the Executive Board. It may be convened in special session whenever the Executive Board shall deem necessary and shall be convened within thirty days after request by one-third of the members of the Council.
4. The Council shall perform the functions assigned to it under this Agreement and review the work of the Organisation generally to ensure its conformity with the broad policies determined by the Council.
The Executive Board. 5. The Executive Board shall consist of seven members who shall
be appointed by the Council. These seven members shall include one member nominated by each of the following Governments : the Provisional Government of the French Republic and the Governments of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America. Each member of the Executive Board shall be provided with an alternate similarly selected , who shall act only in the absence of the member of the Executive for whom he is the alternate.

6. The Executive Board shall perform the executive functions assigned to the Organisation within the framework of the broad policies determined by the Council. It shall act in accordance with the ruling of the majority of its members. It shall present to the Council such reports on the performance of its functions as the Council may require.

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [59 STAT.
8. Each member Government shall appoint one or more representatives for the purpose of consultation and communication with the Executive Board, and with the Chief Officer. Such representatives shall be fully informed by the Board and by the Chief Officer of all activities of the Organisation. Each time that any important question concerning the interests of a member Government is discussed by the Board, the representatives of that Government shall be entitled to take part in the discussions without the right of vote.
ARTICLE IV.
1. The Organisation shall have the capacity to perform any legal act appropriate to its object and purposes, including the power to acquire, hold and convey property, to enter into contracts and undertake obligations, to designate or create subordinate organs and to review their activity.

Each member Government undertakes, subject to the requirements of its constitutional procedure, promptly to contribute to the Organisation, in such currency or currencies as may be agreed by such Government with the Executive Board, its share of these expenses. Each member Government shall also provide such facilities as are required for the transfer into other currencies of sums so contributed and held by the Organisation in that Government's own currency.
2. The Organisation shall not incur any expenses, other than administrative expenses, except under the authority of the Council. Proposals for such expenses shall be submitted by the Executive Board to the Council and, when approved by the Council , such expenses shall be met by contributions which one or more member Governments may agree to make or in such other manner as may be agreed between member Governments. However, the obligation of transfer into foreign currencies, as defined in paragraph 1 of this Article, does not apply to these contributions.

59 STAT. ] MULTILATERAL- TRANSPORT ORGANIZATION- SEPT. 27, 1945

ARTICLE VI . - Scope of the Organisation.
1. The Organisation shall , after giving notice of its intention , exercise its functions in any territory in Continental Europe, upon the acceptance of this Agreement by the Government of that territory and/or, in appropriate cases, provided that the Allied Commanderin-Chief concerned is satisfied that military exigencies permit and subject to such conditions as he may deem necessary.
2. In respect of any territory in Continental Europe in which any Allied Commander- in- Chief retains responsibility for the direction of the transport system, the Organisation shall on request give advice or assistance to the Allied Commander-in-Chief, and, in consultation with him, to any member Government or to other appropriate authorities of the United Nations, on any question with which it is empowered to deal under Article VII.
3. The Organisation shall treat with any of the Occupation Authorities set up by Governments of the United Nations in respect of any territory in Continental Europe in which such Occupation Authorities are exercising authority.
ARTICLE VII. Executive Functions of the Organisation.
Introductory. 1. The Organisation shall carry out thorough studies of the tech-
nical and economic conditions affecting traffic of an international character and shall give to the Governments concerned with such traffic technical advice and recommendations directed to restoring and increasing the carrying capacity of the transport systems in Continental Europe and to co- ordinating the movement of traffic of common concern on these systems.
2. In case of any member Government meets with difficulties in carrying out these recommendations owing to reasons of a material or economic character, the Organisation shall investigate with member Governments concerned means of practical help.
Information on Transport Equipment and Material. 3. The Organisation shall receive and collect information concern-
ing the requirements of transport equipment and material for Continental Europe.
Realisation of Requirements for Transport Equipment and material. 4. The Organisation shall assist the realisation of requirements of

5. The Organisation shall, within the framework of the priorities determined by the appropriate authorities of the United Nations, de-

1743

1744

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [59 STAT.
termine the allocation , or distribution for use, to Governments in Continental Europe, on such conditions as it may deem necessary, of such transport equipment and material as may be made available for this purpose by the Allied Commanders-in-Chief, by Occupation Authorities, or by agencies of any one or more of the United Nations. To enable the Organisation to carry out this function effectively, it may consult with the Governments concerned on their export possibilities of, and import needs of, transport equipment and material for Continental Europe and will receive from such Governments notification of all arrangements made in respect thereto of which they have notice.
Arrangements to make Mobile Transport Equipment and Material available.
6. In cases where temporary emergency requirements of mobile transport equipment for carrying traffic of common concern arise and the usual arrangements for the interchange of such mobile transport equipment are inadequate, the Organisation shall arrange with member Governments concerned to make available mobile transport equipment for the purpose of meeting such requirements. Such mobile transport equipment shall be made available under arrangements made between the member Governments concerned , with the assistance of the Organisation.
Census of Transport Equipment and Material. 7. The Organisation shall at the earliest practicable time arrange
through the member Governments for a census of rolling-stock in Continental Europe and of such other transport equipment and material there as may appear necessary for the proper discharge of its functions. Identification and Restoration of Transport Equipment and
Material.
8. The Organisation shall arrange, as soon as practicable, to restore to any member Government transport equipment and material belonging to it or to its nationals, found outside the territories under its authority and outside its control. Should any difficulties of identification arise, the Organisation shall arrange immediately for such special measures to be taken as may be necessary to meet them. Where such restoration would unduly prejudice the operation of essential transport, the Organisation shall work out agreements with the Governments concerned for the temporary use of transport equipment pending its restoration. The arrangements for restoration shall be made on the basis of the ownership of the property which existed before any territorial changes in Europe, resulting from Axis policy, and in accordance with any general policies which may be determined by the appropriate authorities of the United Nations regarding restoration and restitution of the property removed by the enemy.
Traffic.
9. The Organisation may make such recommendations to the appropriate authorities as it deems necessary with respect to the

59 STAT. ] MULTILATERAL- TRANSPORT ORGANIZATION- SEPT. 27, 1945

method of carrying out projected movements of traffic of common concern, having regard to the transport facilities available for the movement of such traffic.
10. The Organisation shall make recommendations to the Governments concerned in order to ensure the movement of traffic of
common concern on all routes of transport in Continental Europe in accordance with the priorities determined by the appropriate authorities of the United Nations.

59 STAT. ] MULTILATERAL- TRANSPORT ORGANIZATION-SEPT. 27, 1945
Arrangements en vue de rendre disponible du Matériel de Transport. 6. S'il se présente des besoins urgents et temporaires de matériel
mobile de transport pour faire face à un trafic d'intérêt commun, et si les arrangements habituels concernant l'échange de ce matériel se révèlent insuffisants, l'Office s'entend avec les Gouvernements contractants intéressés pour rendre disponibles les moyens de transport nécessaires à la satisfaction de ces besoins. De tels moyens de transport sont rendus disponibles par des arrangements entre les Gouvernements contractants intéressés, avec l'assistance de l'Office.
Recensement du Matériel de Transport. 7. L'Office fait procéder, aussitôt que possible, par l'entremise des
Gouvernements contractants, à un recensement du matériel roulant en Europe Continentale et de telles catégories de matériel de transport qui paraîtraient nécessaires pour lui permettre de remplir correctement ses fonctions.

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [ 59 STAT.
las primeras 500.000 (quinientas mil ) toneladas métricas a suministrarse de acuerdo al párrafo A-1 anterior durante el período de 12 (doce) meses a partir de la fecha de este Acuerdo, con un mínimo mensual de aproximadamente 5.000 ( cinco mil ) toneladas métricas, y se compromete además a hacer disponible espacio de bodega en barcos rumbo al sur para la entrega de no menos de 100.000 ( cien mil ) toneladas métricas o el 20% ( veinte por ciento ) de la cantidad de fuel oil a que se refiere el mismo párrafo, correspondiente a la cosecha 1945/46, la que fuese mayor, cuyo espacio se hará disponible en las cantidades mensuales que resulten factibles y que en cualquier caso deberán completarse al 31 de diciembre de 1946.
3. Queda entendido que la U.S. Commercial Company no asume responsabilidad para suministrar medios de transporte para la cantidad restante de fuel oil cuya entrega deberá autorizarse , aunque se tiene le esperanza de que antes de la terminación del período de entrega existan facilidades adicionales a las que actualmente son accesibles al Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de América.
4. Además de las cantidades de fuel oil arriba mencionadas, la cantidad de aproximadamente 15.000 ( quince mil ) toneladas métricas de fuel oil que actualmente retiene la Compañía Argentina de Navegación Dodero S.A. en Buenos Aires , será librada al consumo interno en la Argentina y queda claramente entendido que una cantidad de semilla de lino y sus sub-productos , de un valor calórico equivalente al fuel oil en cuestión, se hará disponible para su entrega bajo este Acuerdo en el curso de los primeros ocho meses.
5. A cambio del embarque inmediato entre el 15 de mayo y el 15 de junio de 1945 de aproximadamente 7.000 (siete mil ) toneladas métricas de fuel oil, que representan la primera entrega , en espacio de bodega de buque petrolero dispuesto por la U.S. Commercial Company de acuerdo al párrafo A-3, el Gobierno argentino se compromete, bajo este Acuerdo, a hacer disponible puntualmente 7.000 ( siete mil ) toneladas de torta o harina de semilla de lino, y 3.500 (tres mil quinientas ) toneladas métricas de aceite de semilla de lino, F.O.B. , debiendo suministrarse el saldo del equivalente calórico en entregas subsiguientes durante el primer trimestre.
6. Con respecto al compromiso contraído de acuerdo al párrafo A-1, queda convenido de mútuo acuerdo que el Gobierno argentino hará disponible sobre una base F.O.B. en cada trimestre a partir de la fecha de este Acuerdo, una cantidad de semilla de lino y sus sub-productos aproximadamente equivalente al valor calórico del fuel oil importado bajo este Acuerdo durante dicho período , y que cualquiera diferencia que surgiera será compensada en el período siguiente. A los fines de este Acuerdo los valores calóricos se computarán en la forma siguiente :
Fuel oil - 10,000 ( diez mil ) calorías por tonelada métrica. Aceite de Semilla de Lino -9,500 (nueve mil quinientas) calorías por
tonelada métrica.

59 STAT. ] ARGENTINA-FUEL AND VEGETABLE OIL- MAY 9, 1945

Semilla de Lino - 5,700 ( cinco mil setecientas ) calorías por tonelada métrica .
Torta de Semilla de Lino y Expellers -4,350 ( cuatro mil trescientas cincuenta ) calorías por tonelada métrica.
Harina de Semilla de Lino Extraída -3,900 ( tres mil novecientas ) calorías por tonelada métrica.

7. Las necesidades de fuel oil de la Compañía Argentina de Nave-

gación Dodero S.A. que, según se entiende, son de aproximadamente 70,000 ( setenta mil ) toneladas métricas por año , se satisfarán además

de las cantidades ya mencionadas, y queda entendido como condición esencial de este Acuerdo que se mantendrá la disponibilidad de los

petroleros de dicha Compañía para transportar aceites vegetales a los Estados Unidos de América.

8. Queda mutuamente entendido y convenido que las importaciones de fuel -oil serán autorizadas unicamente para aquellas compañías, argentinas, británicas y estadounidenses que figuraban como importadores en el año 1941 , o que efectuaron ventas de fuel oil para ser eventualmente importado por industrias consumidoras de este producto en la Argentina durante ese año, y que cada una de esas compañías participará de acuerdo a los porcentajes siguientes :

Astra Cia. General de Combustibles . Shell Mex .. Cia. Nativa de Petróleo .

· 2.25 (dos con veinticinco ) · 26. 84 (veintiseis con ochenta y cuatro) · 36.83 (trienta y seis con ochenta y tres ) .
34. 08 (treinta y cuatro con cero ocho ) .

El fuel oil en cuestión es fuel oil residual originario de Trinidad, Aruba o Curaçao. En la medida en que se emplee espacio de bodega en petroleros argentinos, la elección del punto de origen queda a opción del Gobierno argentino, pero en lo que respecta al espacio de bodega de petroleros suministrado por la U.S. Commercial Company, dicha elección queda a opción de esta Compañía. Debe notarse que existe una diferencia en las especificaciones entre el fuel oil originario de Trinidad y en el de los otros dos puntos nombrados.

9. El precio del fuel oil suministrado bajo este Acuerdo será el que corresponda al precio corriente de plaza vigente en cada puerto en la fecha de cada embarque, pero no será mayor del precio internacional equivalente .

10. Con respecto al compromiso de la U.S. Commercial Company de hacer disponible fuel oil y de suministrar el espacio de bodega en petroleros para la entrega de cantidades limitadas de dicho producto según se establece en párrafos precedentes, la U.S. Commercial Company se reserva expresamente el derecho de interrumpir el cumplimiento de estas obligaciones unicamente en el caso de que acontecimientos no actualmente previsibles relacionados con nuestro esfuerzo bélico conjunto hicieran necesaria tal interrupción. No obstante, en tal caso la parte restante de esas obligaciones serían cumplidas tan pronto como hubieren desaparecido las causas de la interrupción.

EXCELLENCY,

I have the honor to address Your Excellency with reference to the

negotiations carried out between Mr. Randolph Powell Butler , Special

Agent of the U.S. Commercial Company , an agency of the Government of the United States of America , and His Excellency The Sec-

retary of Industry and Commerce of the Republic of Argentina,

Brigadier-General Julio C. Checci, and to express the agreement of my Government to the following clauses :

A. FUEL OIL AND SHIPPING

1. The U.S. Commercial Company agrees to make available for shipment to Argentina, as soon as practicable after this date, not less than 500,000 (Five Hundred Thousand ) metric tons of fuel oil, in consideration of the Argentine Government's agreement hereafter set forth to sell to the U.S. Commercial Company the entire exportable surplus, subject to the reservations hereafter established, of flaxseed and its products, arising from the 1944-1945 or prior crops, and to extend other guaranties as herein outlined. Furthermore, the U.S. Commercial Company agrees to make available for shipment to Argentina, upon completion of the foregoing quantity and up to December 31 , 1946, an additional 500,000 ( Five Hundred Thousand ) metric tons of fuel oil , or a quantity of fuel oil equivalent to the caloric value of the 1945-1946 exportable surplus of flaxseed and its products , whichever is higher, in consideration of the Argentine Government's agreement hereafter set forth to sell to the U.S. Commercial Company the entire exportable surplus of flaxseed and its products, aris-

1808
Supra. Ante, p. 1807.

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [ 59 STAT.
ing from the 1945-1946 crop ; provided that in no event shall the U.S. Commercial Company be required to deliver fuel oil of a caloric value in excess of the total caloric value of the exportable surpluses of all of the flaxseed or its products delivered under this contract.
2. The U.S. Commercial Company agrees to make available southbound tank space for delivery of not less than 100,000 ( One Hundred Thousand ) metric tons of fuel oil , applying to the first quantity of 500,000 (Five Hundred Thousand ) metric tons to be supplied under Paragraph A-1 above, during a twelve-months period counted from the date of this agreement with a monthly minimum of approximately 5000 ( Five Thousand ) tons and , in addition , southbound tank space for delivery of not less than 100,000 ( One Hundred Thousand ) tons or 20% (Twenty Percent ) , whichever is higher, of the quantity of fuel oil provided in that paragraph as applying to the 1945-1946 crop, such space to be made available in the monthly amounts which may prove feasible, and in any event to be completed by December 31 , 1946.
3. It is understood that as to the remainder of the fuel oil to be
supplied, no responsibility for providing transportation rests with the U.S. Commercial Company, although it is hoped that facilities in addition to those now available to the United States Government
may present themselves before the conclusion of the period. 4. Also, in addition to the foregoing quantities of fuel oil , the
quantity of approximately 15,000 (Fifteen Thousand ) metric tons of fuel oil now held by the Compañía Argentina de Navegación Dodero, S.A. in Buenos Aires will be released for internal consumption in Argentina and it is clearly understood that a quantity of flaxseed and its products, equivalent to the caloric value of this fuel oil, will be made available for delivery under this agreement in the course of the first eight months.
5. In consideration of the immediate shipment between May 15 and June 15, 1945 of approximately 7,000 ( Seven Thousand ) metric tons of fuel oil, representing the first delivery, in tank space arranged for by the U.S. Commercial Company, in accordance with Paragraph A-3, the Argentine Government will promptly make available, f.o.b. , under the agreement, 7,000 ( Seven Thousand ) tons of linseed cake or meal and 3,500 ( Three Thousand Five Hundred ) metric tons of linseed oil, the balance of the caloric equivalent to be made up in subsequent deliveries during the first three-months period.
6. In connection with the commitment contained in Paragraph A-1, it is mutually agreed that the Argentine Government will make available on an f.o.b. basis, in each three-months period, counted from the date of this agreement, a quantity of flaxseed and its products approximately equivalent to the caloric value of the fuel oil imported under the agreement during such period, and that any differences shall be compensated in the ensuing period. For the purpose of this agreement, caloric values shall be computed as follows :

59 STAT. ] ARGENTINA- FUEL AND VEGETABLE OIL- MAY 9, 1945

1809

Fuel Oil- 10,000 ( Ten Thousand ) calories per metric ton Linseed oil-9,500 ( Nine Thousand Five Hundred ) calories per

Linseed Cake & Expellers -4,350 (Four Thousand Three Hundred and Fifty) calories per metric ton
Extracted Linseed Meal-3,900 (Three Thousand Nine Hundred) calories per metric ton

7. The fuel oil requirements of the Compañía Argentina de Navegación Dodero, S.A. , which are understood to be approximately 70,000 ( Seventy Thousand ) metric tons per annum, will be supplied in addition to the foregoing quantities and it is understood that the continued availability of this Company's tankers to carry vegetable oils to the United States of America is a necessary condition of this proposal.
8. It is mutually understood and agreed that imports of fuel oil will be authorized only through those oil companies, Argentine, British and American , who figured as importers in the year 1941 , and/or who made sales of fuel oil for subsequent importation by consuming industries in Argentina during that year, and that each such company shall share in accordance with the following percentages :

ASTRA ... Cía. General de Combustibles Shell-Mex · Cía. Nativa de Petroleos

2.25% · · 26.84%
· 36. 83% 34.08%

(Two and twenty-five hundredths percent) (Twenty-six and eighty-four hundredths percent) (Thirty-six and eighty-three hundredths percent)
( Thirty-four and eight hundredths percent )

The fuel oil in question is residual fuel oil originating in Trinidad , Aruba or Curacao. To the extent that Argentine tank space is em-

ployed, the choice of point of origin shall be at the option of the Argentine Government but to the extent that tank space is arranged

by the U.S. Commercial Company, such choice shall be at the option of the U.S. Commercial Company. It should be noted that there is a difference in specifications between the oil originating in Trinidad and in the other two named sources.
9. The f.o.b. price of all fuel oil supplied hereunder will be the

MINISTERIO DE

RELACIONES EXTERIORES

CM . 415.-

Bogotá, abril 17 de 1945

SEÑOR EMBAJADOR :

En relación con la fórmula contractual sobre tarifas preferenciales

entre países limítrofes o vecinos , prevista tanto en la Resolución Número LXXX de la Séptima Conferencia Interamericana, aprobada el 24 de diciembre de 1933 , como en la Recomendación adoptada por el Comité Consultivo Financiero Económico Interamericano el 18 de

septiembre de 1941 , tengo el honor de manifestar a Vuestra Excelencia

lo siguiente :

En el Artículo 5° del Tratado de Comercio entre Colombia y

Ecuador de 6 de julio de 1942-que con su Convención Adícional de

14 de octubre de 1943 fué aprobado por el Congreso Nacional según

ley 103 de 1944-, se permite la entrada a Colombia , libre de derechos

de importación, de ciertos productos originarios y provenientes del

Ecuador, especificados en una lista.

Pero como quiera que el artículo VII del Convenio Comercial entre Colombia y los Estados Unidos , firmado el 13 de septiembre de 1935 , dispone que cada uno de los dos países conceda al otro el tratamiento incondicional e irrestricto de la nación más favorecida en todos los

asuntos relacionados con las aduanas, muy atentamente ruego a Vuestra Excelencia comunicarme si el Gobierno de los Estados Unidos

convendría en no acogerse a esta disposición con el propósito de reclamar el beneficio de las preferencias arancelarias exclusivas otorgadas por Colombia al Ecuador.

Al formular esta consulta, aprovecho la oportunidad para reiterar

al Gobierno de los Estados Unidos , por el alto conducto de Vuestra

Excelencia, la seguridad de que mi Gobierno está en un todo de acuerdo

con el principio del tratamiento incondicional de la nación más

favorecida para el desarrollo multilateral del comercio internacional,

y que estima muy claramente que la excepción propuesta ahora a

dicho principio, se ciñe tanto a lo expresado en la mencionada Resolu-

ción LXXX de Montevideo , como a los tres siguientes requisitos de la Recomendación del Comité Consultivo Financiero Económico Interamericano :

2. The U.S. Commercial Company agrees to make available southbound tank space for delivery of not less than 100,000 ( One Hundred Thousand ) metric tons of fuel oil, applying to the first quantity of 500,000 ( Five Hundred Thousand) metric tons to be supplied under Paragraph A-1 above, during a twelve-months period counted from the date of this agreement with a monthly minimum of approximately 5000 ( Five Thousand ) tons and, in addition , southbound tank space for delivery of not less than 100,000 ( One Hundred Thousand) tons or 20% (Twenty Percent ) , whichever is higher, of the quantity of fuel oil provided in that paragraph as applying to the 1945-1946 crop , such space to be made available in the monthly amounts which may prove feasible, and in any event to be completed by December 31, 1946.
3. It is understood that as to the remainder of the fuel oil to be
supplied, no responsibility for providing transportation rests with the U.S. Commercial Company, although it is hoped that facilities in addition to those now available to the United States Government
may present themselves before the conclusion of the period. 4. Also, in addition to the foregoing quantities of fuel oil , the
quantity of approximately 15,000 ( Fifteen Thousand ) metric tons of fuel oil now held by the Compañía Argentina de Navegación Dodero, S.A. in Buenos Aires will be released for internal consumption in Argentina and it is clearly understood that a quantity of flaxseed and its products, equivalent to the caloric value of this fuel oil, will be made available for delivery under this agreement in the course of the first eight months.
5. In consideration of the immediate shipment between May 15 and June 15, 1945 of approximately 7,000 ( Seven Thousand ) metric tons of fuel oil, representing the first delivery, in tank space arranged for by the U.S. Commercial Company, in accordance with Paragraph A-3, the Argentine Government will promptly make available, f.o.b. , under the agreement, 7,000 ( Seven Thousand ) tons of linseed cake or meal and 3,500 (Three Thousand Five Hundred ) metric tons of linseed oil, the balance of the caloric equivalent to be made up in subsequent deliveries during the first three-months period .
6. In connection with the commitment contained in Paragraph A-1, it is mutually agreed that the Argentine Government will make available on an f.o.b. basis, in each three-months period, counted from the date of this agreement, a quantity of flaxseed and its products approximately equivalent to the caloric value of the fuel oil imported under the agreement during such period , and that any differences shall be compensated in the ensuing period. For the purpose of this agreement, caloric values shall be computed as follows :

8. It is mutually understood and agreed that imports of fuel oil will be authorized only through those oil companies, Argentine, British and American, who figured as importers in the year 1941 , and/or who made sales of fuel oil for subsequent importation by consuming industries in Argentina during that year, and that each such company shall share in accordance with the following percentages :

Al formular esta consulta, aprovecho la oportunidad para reiterar al Gobierno de los Estados Unidos , por el alto conducto de Vuestra Excelencia, la seguridad de que mi Gobierno está en un todo de acuerdo con el principio del tratamiento incondicional de la nación más favorecida para el desarrollo multilateral del comercio internacional, y que estima muy claramente que la excepción propuesta ahora a dicho principio, se ciñe tanto a lo expresado en la mencionada Resolución LXXX de Montevideo , como a los tres siguientes requisitos de la Recomendación del Comité Consultivo Financiero Económico Interamericano :

"Que tales preferencias arancelarias regionales no deben impedir ningún amplio programa de reconstrucción económica que contemple la reducción de aranceles y la reducción o eliminación de preferencias tarifarias y otras preferencias comerciales con el propósito de lograr el más amplio desarrollo del comercio internacional sobre una base multilateral e incondicional de la nación más favorecida" .

Ruego a Vuestra Excelencia aceptar las seguridades de mi más

MR. AMBASSADOR :

With reference to the contractual formula for preferential tariffs

between contiguous or neighboring countries, contemplated in Res-
StDateepaPurbtlmiecnattioonf olution Number LXXX of the Seventh Inter-American Conference, ap666.
proved December 24, 1933 , as well as in the Recommendation adopted

by the Inter-American Financial and Economic Advisory Committee

September 18, 1941 , I have the honor to make the following statement to Your Excellency :

49 Stat . 3882.

In Article 5 of the Treaty of Commerce between Colombia and Ecuador of July 6 , 1942- which with its Additional Convention of October 14 , 1943 was approved by the National Congress according to Law 103 of 1944-, the entry into Colombia is permitted , free of import duties, of certain products originating in and coming from Ecuador, as itemized in a list.
However, since Article VII of the Trade Agreement between Colombia and the United States, signed September 13, 1935 , provides that each of the two countries shall grant the other unconditional and unrestricted most-favored-nation treatment in all customs matters, I very respectfully request Your Excellency to inform me whether the Government of the United States would agree not to resort to this

59 STAT. ] COLOMBIA- COMMERCIAL RELATIONS-APR. 17, 1945
provision for the purpose of claiming the benefit of the exclusive customs tariff preferences granted by Colombia to Ecuador.
In formulating this inquiry, I avail myself of the opportunity to reiterate to the Government of the United States, through the high intermediary of Your Excellency, the assurance that my Government is completely in accord with the principle of unconditional mostfavored-nation treatment for the multilateral development of international trade, and that it has very clearly in mind that the exception now proposed to said principle is limited to what is set forth in the aforementioned Resolution LXXX of Montevideo, as well as to the three following requirements of the Recommendation of the InterAmerican Financial and Economic Advisory Committee:
"That any such tariff preferences , in order to be an instrument for sound promotion of trade, should be made effective through trade agreements embodying tariff reductions or exemptions ;
"That the parties to such agreements should reserve the right to reduce or eliminate the customs duties on like imports from other countries ; and
"That any such regional tariff preferences should not be permitted to stand in the way of any broad program of economic reconstruction involving the reduction of tariffs and the scaling down or elimination of tariff and other trade preferences with a view to the fullest possible development of international trade on a multilateral unconditional most-favored-nation basis."
I beg Your Excellency to accept the assurance of my highest and most distinguished consideration .

the exclusive tariff preferences to Ecuador provided for in Article V

of the Treaty of Commerce between Colombia and that country

signed on July 6 , 1942 and amended on October 14 , 1943 . You inquire whether the Government of the United States of
America will agree, on the basis of this formula, to refrain from claim-

ing, under the provisions of Article VII of the trade agreement between our two countries signed on September 13 , 1935 , the benefit of the

tariff preferences to Ecuador specifically provided for in the abovementioned treaty.

I have the honor to state that my Government, while recognizing its adherence to the formula recommended by the Inter-American Financial and Economic Advisory Committee , desires to call attention to the fact that , mindful of the fourth and fifth principles of the Atlantic Charter, it attaches great importance to the final requirement quoted in Your Excellency's note which states that regional preferences should not be permitted to stand in the way of any broad program of economic reconstruction involving the reduction of tariffs and the scaling down or elimination of tariff and other trade preferences with a view to the fullest possible development of international trade on a multilateral unconditional most-favored-nation basis .
With these considerations in view, the Government of the United

States agrees not to invoke the pertinent provisions of the trade

agreement between our two countries for the purpose of claiming the

benefit of the tariff preferences to Ecuador provided in Article V of

the Treaty of Commerce between Colombia and Ecuador.

Accept, Excellency, the renewed assurances of my highest con-

sideration .

The Norwegian Company in Iceland shall be furnished by the Norwegian Government with necessary clothing, equipment and weapons. However, special winter equipment shall be issued by the United States authorities to the extent that the United States Com-
manding Officer deems desirable . The United States authorities shall provide the Company with rations, quarters and medical service, on the same scale as furnished American forces stationed in Iceland, and also effect repairs to clothes and equipment, insofar as facilities permit.

AGREEMENT

The leaders of the three Great Powers - the Soviet Union, the United States of America and Great Britain - have agreed that in two or three months after Germany has surrendered and the war in Europe has terminated the Soviet Union shall enter into the war against Japan on the side of the Allies on condition that:

1. The status quo in Outer-Mongolia (The Mongolian People's Republic) shall be preserved ;
2. The former rights of Russia violated by the treacherous attack of Japan in 1904 shall be restored, viz :

(a) the southern part of Sakhalin as well as all the islands adjacent to it shall be returned to the Soviet Union,
(b) the commercial port of Dairen shall be internationalized , the preeminent interests of the Soviet Union in this port being safeguarded and the lease of Port Arthur as a naval base of the USSR restored ,
(c) the Chinese-Eastern Railroad and the South-Manchurian Railroad which provides an outlet to Dairen shall be jointly operated by the establishment of a joint Soviet-Chinese Company it being understood that the preeminent interests of the Soviet Union shall be safeguarded and that China shall retain full sovereignty in Manchuria;

3. The Kuril islands shall be handed over to the Soviet Union. It is understood, that the agreement concerning Outer- Mongolia and the ports and railroads referred to above will require concurrence of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-Shek. The President will take measures in order to obtain this concurrence on advice from Marshal Stalin . The Heads of the three Great Powers have agreed that these claims of the Soviet Union shall be unquestionably fulfilled after Japan has been defeated .

For its part the Soviet Union expresses its readiness to conclude

with the National Government of China a pact of friendship and alliance between the USSR and China in order to render assistance to

China with its armed forces for the purpose of liberating China from

the Japanese yoke.

EMBASSY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Port-au-Prince, Haiti, August 14, 1945.

EXCELLENCY :

I have the honor to inform Your Excellency that the United States Government would view with favor an arrangement for the extension

of the free importation privileges on a strict basis of reciprocity, to American Consular officers and clerks in the Mission and Consular

offices, assigned to Haiti ; and to Haitian Consular officers and clerks

in the Mission and Consular offices, assigned to the United States.

It is proposed that, in addition to the free entry of personal baggage and effects upon arrival and upon return to their posts in the United States after visits abroad, which Haitian consular officers already enjoy, such officers and the clerks in the Mission and Consular offices, who are Haitian nationals and not engaged in any private occupation

for gain, on a basis of reciprocity, would be accorded the privilege of importing free of duty articles for their personal use at any time during the period that they exercise essential government functions

in the United States , on the understanding that no article, the importation of which is prohibited by the laws of the United States , should be imported by them.
The arrangement would likewise provide that American Consular officers and clerks in the Mission and Consular offices, who are nationals of the United States and not engaged in any private occupation

for gain, would be accorded in Haiti the privileges as set forth above.
Accept , Excellency, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration.
