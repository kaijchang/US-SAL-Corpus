CONSIDERING :

That according to the statement of Franklin D.

That every war or threat of war affects directly or indirectly all civilized peoples and endangers the great principles of liberty and justice which constitute the American ideal and the standard of American international policy;
That the Treaty of Paris of 1928 (Kellogg-Briand Pact) has been accepted by almost all the civilized states, whether or not members of other peace organizations, and that the Treaty of Non-Aggression and Conciliation of 1933 (Saavedra Lamas Pact signed at Rio de Janeiro) has the approval of the twenty-one American Republics represented in this Conference,

tween them shall be effected only by pacific means which have the sanction of international law, and also declare that as between them territorial questions must not be settled by violence, and that they will not recognize any territorial arrangement not obtained by pacific means, nor the validity of the occupation or acquisition of territories brought about by force of arms, and , moreover, in a case of non-compliance with these obligations, the contracting states undertake to adopt, in their character as neutrals, a common and solidary attitude and to exercise the political, juridical or economic means authorized by international law, and to bring the influence of public opinion to bear, without, however, resorting to intervention, either diplomatic or armed, subject nevertheless to the attitude that may be incumbent upon them by virtue of their collective treaties ; and, furthermore, undertake to create a procedure of conciliation ;

(4.) In signing this Convention, the Delegation of Colombia under-

stands that the phrase "in their character as neutrals," which appears

in Articles V and VI , implies a new concept of international law which allows a distinction to be drawn between the aggressor and the at-

tacked, and to treat them differently . At the same time, the Dele-

gation of Colombia considers it necessary , in order to assure the full and
effective application of this Pact, to set down in writing the following definition of the aggressor:

That State shall be considered as an aggressor which becomes re-

sponsible for one or several of the following acts:

a) That its armed forces , to whatever branch they may belong, illegally cross the land , sea or air frontiers of other States . When the

violation of the territory of a State has been effected by irresponsible bands organized within or outside of its territory and which have re-

ceived direct or indirect help from another State, such violation shall be considered equivalent , for the purposes of the present Article, to

that effected by the regular forces of the State responsible for the agression ;

b) That it has intervened in a unilateral or illegal way in the internal or external affairs of another State ;

c) That it has refused to fulfil a legally given arbitral decision or sentence of international justice .

No consideration of any kind , whether political, military, economic

or of any other kind, may serve as an excuse or justification for the aggression here anticipated .

Article I.-Considérant que, par le Traité pour éviter ou empêcher les Conflits Internationaux entre les Etats Américains, signé à Santiago le 3 Mai 1923 (connu sous le nom de traité Gondra ) , les Hautes Parties Contractantes ont convenu que toute question qui n'aurait pu être résolue par la voie diplomatique ni soumise à l'arbitrage, en vertu des traités existants, sera soumise à une Commission d'enquête qui en fera rapport;
Que, par le Traité de Renonciation à la Guerre, signé à Paris le 28 août 1928 (connu sous le nom de Pacte Kellogg-Briand ou Pacte de Paris) , les Hautes Parties Contractantes ont déclaré solennellement, au nom de leurs nations respectives, qu'elles condamnent tout recours à la guerre pour le règlement des différends internationaux et y renoncent comme instrument de politique nationale dans leurs relations mutuelles ;
Que, par la Convention Générale de Conciliation Interaméricaine, signée à Washington le 5 janvier 1929 , les Hautes Parties Contractantes ont convenu de soumettre à la procédure de conciliation tous les différends qui peuvent s'élever entre elles et qu'il n'aurait pas été possible de régler par la voie diplomatique, et d'établir une Commission de Conciliation pour exécuter les obligations assumées dans la dite Convention ;

TREATIES
Que, par le Traité Général d'Arbitrage Interaméricain , signé à Washington le 5 janvier 1929 , les Hautes Parties Contractantes se sont engagées à soumettre à l'arbitrage, sauf certaines exceptions , tous les différends de caractère international, qui n'auraient pas été réglés par la voie diplomatique, et ayant un caractère juridique, c'est-à-dire susceptibles d'être décidés par l'application des principes de droit, et en outre, à établir entre elles et à suivre une procédure d'arbitrage ;
Que par le Traité de Non Agression et de Conciliation , signé à Rio de Janeiro , le 10 octobre 1933 (connu sous le nom de Traité Saavedra Lamas) , les Hautes Parties Contractantes ont déclaré solennellement qu'elles condamnent les guerres d'agression dans leurs relations mutuelles ou avec d'autres Etats ; que le règlement des conflits ou différends de toutes sortes qui s'éléveront entre elles ne devra être obtenu que par des moyens pacifiques consacrés par le droit international , qu'elles ont également déclaré, en ce qui les concerne, que les questions territoriales ne doivent pas être réglées par la violence, et qu'elles ne reconnaîtront aucun règlement territorial qui ne soit pas obtenu par des moyens pacifiques, ni la validité de l'occupation ou de l'acquisition de territoires, effectuée par la force des armes, en outre , qu'en cas de non-accomplissement de ces engagements , les Etats Contractants adopteront, en leur qualité de neutres, une attitude commune et solidaire , et mettront en oeuvre les moyens politiques , juridiques ou économiques autorisés par le Droit International et qu'ils porteront l'opinion publique à agir par son influence, tout en évitant de recourir à aucune intervention diplomatique ou armée, sans cependant renoncer à l'attitude que leur imposent leurs traités collectifs ;
Et qu'ils s'engagent, en outre , à établir une procédure de conciliation ; Les Hautes Parties Contractantes réaffirment les engagements con-
tractés par elles de donner une solution par des moyens pacifiques, aux controverses d'ordre international qui peuvent surgir entre elles.
Art. II.- Les Hautes Parties Contractantes, convaincues de l'utilité de la coopération et de la consultation stipulées dans la Convention pour le Maintien, la Préservation et le Rétablissement de la Paix,
signée entre elles le 23 décembre 1936 , conviennent qu'en toutes questions qui affectent la paix sur le continent, la consultation et la coopération susmentionnées auront pour objet de faciliter, par l'offre amicale de leurs bons offices, et de leur médiation l'accomplissement par les Républiques Américaines, des engagements existants pour un règlement pacifique, et de délibérer, en pleine reconnaissance de leur égalité juridique comme Etats souverains et indépendants et de tous leurs droits à la liberté d'action individuelle, lorsque surgira une divergence capable d'affecter leur intérét commun ou le maintien de la paix.
Art. III.- En cas de menace de guerre , les Hautes Parties Contractantes exécuteront les dispositions contenues dans les articles I et II de la Convention pour le Maintien, la Préservation et le Rétablissement de la Paix ; il est entendu que, pendant la durée de la consultation et pour une période ne dépassant pas six mois , les Parties en désaccord ne recourront pas aux hostilités et s'abstiendront de toute action militaire .
Art. IV. Les Hautes Parties Contractantes conviennent de plus qu'en cas de difficultés entre deux ou plus d'entre elles, elles chercheront à les régler dans un esprit de respect mutuel de leurs droits respectifs , en recourant, pour cet objet, à des négociations diplomatiques ou successivement à des procédures de médiation, aux commissions d'enquête, aux commissions de conciliation , aux tribunaux d'arbitrage et aux cours de justice comme il est prévu dans les traités auxquels elles

INTER-AMERICAN- COORDINATION, ETC., OF EXISTING TREATIES -DEC . 23, 1936 147
sont parties ; elles conviennent également que s'il était impossible de régler ces différends par la voie diplomatique et si les Etats en désaccord ont recours aux autres procédures prévues dans le présent article , elles en informeront les autres Etats signataires et les tiendront au courant de la marche des négociations.
Ces stipulations ne concernent pas les différends déjà soumis à une procédure diplomatique ou judiciaire en vertu d'accords spéciaux .
Art. V.-Les Hautes Parties Contractantes conviennent que, dans le cas où les méthodes prévues par la présente Convention ou par des accords antérieurs n'aboutiraient pas à un règlement pacifique des différends qui peuvent s'élever entre deux ou plus d'entre elles , et que s'ouvriraient les hostilités, elles procéderont conformément aux stipulations suivantes :
a ) Elles adopteront, selon les termes du Traité de Non Agression et de Conciliation (Traité Saavedra Lamas) , en leur qualité de neutres , une attitude commune et solidaire ; elles se consulteront immédiatement entre elles et prendront connaissance de l'ouverture des hostilités pour déterminer, conjointement ou séparément, si les dites hostilités constituent un état de guerre afin d'appliquer les stipulations de la présente Convention .
b) Il est entendu qu'en ce qui concerne la question de savoir si les hostilités en cours constituent ou non un état de guerre, chacune des Hautes Parties Contractantes devra prendre une prompte décision . Dans tous les cas, si les hostilités se poursuivent entre deux ou plus des Parties Contractantes ou entre deux ou plus des Etats signataires qui, à ce moment, ne seraient pas parties à cette Convention pour ne l'avoir pas ratifiée, chacune des Parties Contractantes prendra connaissance de la situation et adoptera l'attitude qui lui incombe en vertu d'autres traités multilatéraux dont elle est partie ou conformément à sa législation interne. Cet acte ne devre pas être considéré comme inamical de la part d'aucun état qu'il affecterait.
Art. VI . Sans préjudice des principes universels sur la neutralité prévus pour le cas de guerre internationale hors d'Amérique, et des obligations contractées par les Etats américains qui seraient membres de la Société des Nations , les Hautes Parties Contractantes réaffirment leur fidélité aux principes énoncés dans les cinq Pactes visés à l'article I , et conviennent que, dans le cas d'ouverture d'hostilités ou de menace d'ouverture d'hostilités entre deux ou plus d'entre elles, elles s'efforceront immédiatement d'adopter, en leur qualité de neutres, au moyen d'une consultation, une attitude commune et solidaire dans le but de décourager ou de prévenir l'extension ou la prolongation des hostilités.
Dans ce but, et tenant compte de la diversité des cas et des circonstances, elles pourront envisager des mesures de prohibition ou de restriction concernant la vente ou l'expédition d'armes, munitions et matériel de guerre, emprunts ou autre aide financière aux Etats en conflit, selon la législation interne des Hautes Parties Contractantes, et sans préjudice de leurs obligations dérivant d'autres Traités dont elles sont ou peuvent devenir parties .
Art. VII. Rien de ce qui est stipulé dans la présente Convention ne pourra être interprété comme affectant les droits et les obligations de celles des Hautes Parties Contractantes qui seraient en même temps membres de la Société des Nations.
Art. VIII. La présente Convention sera ratifiée par les Hautes Parties Contractantes conformément à leurs procédures constitutionnelles . La Convention originale et les instruments de ratification seront déposés au Ministère des Affaires Etrangères de la République Argentine, qui fera part des ratifications aux autres Etats signataires . Elle entrera en vigueur lorsque onze au moins des Etats signataires auront fait le dépôt de leurs instruments de ratification .

TREATIES
La Convention restera indéfiniment en vigueur mais elle pourra être dénoncée par l'une quelconque des Parties Contractantes ; cette dénonciation deviendra effective un an après la date de sa notification . La dénonciation sera adressée au Ministère des Affaires Etrangères de la République Argentine, qui en transmettra copie aux autres Etats signataires . Aucune dénonciation ne sera considérée valable si la Partie qui dénonce se trouve en état de guerre ou est engagée dans des hostilités sans avoir accompli les obligations stipulées dans la présente Convention.
En foi de quoi, les Plénipotentiaires précités ont signé la présente Convention, en espagnol, en anglais, en portugais et en français, et y ont apposé leurs sceaux . Fait dans la ville de Buenos Aires , Capitale de la République Argentine, le 23 Décembre 1936 .
Réserve de la Délégation Argentine
1. De par l'Article VI , dans aucun cas, ne pourront être considérées comme contrebande de guerre les denrées alimentaires ou matières premières destinées aux populations civiles des pays belligérants, et il n'existera pas le devoir de prohiber les crédits destinés à l'acquisition desdites denrées ou matières premières qui auraient la destination sus-mentionnée.

Réserve de la Délégation du Paraguay
2. De par l'Article VI , dans aucun cas ne pourront être considérées comme contrebande de guerre les denrées alimentaires ou matières premières destinées aux populations civiles des pays belligérants, et il n'existera pas le devoir de prohiber les crédits destinés à l'acquisition desdites denrées ou matières premières qui auraient la destination sus-mentionnée .

Réserve de la Délégation du Salvador
3. Sous la réserve de l'idée de solidarité continentale face à l'agression étrangère.
Réserve de la Délégation de Colombie
4. La Délégation de Colombie entend , en signant cette Convention , que la phrase "en leur qualité de neutres", qui figure aux Articles V et VI , implique un nouveau concept du Droit International qui permet de distinguer l'attaquant de l'attaqué et de leur octroyer un traitement différent. En même temps, la Délégation de Colombie juge utile, afin d'assurer la pleine et effective application de ce Pacte, de consigner la définition suivante de l'agresseur:
On considérera comme agresseur l'Etat qui se rendra responsable d'un ou de plusieurs des actes suivants:
a) Dont les forces armées, de n'importe quelle arme, auront franchi indûment les frontières terrestres, maritimes ou aériennes , d'autres Etats. Lorsque la violation du territoire d'un Etat aura été effectuée par des bandes irrégulières, organisées à l'intérieur ou hors de son territoire, et qu'elles auront reçu un appui direct ou indirect d'un autre Etat, la violation sera assimilée, aux effets du présent Article , à celle effectuée par les forces régulières de l'Etat responsable de l'agression ;

INTER-AMERICAN-COORDINATION, ETC., OF EXISTING TREATIES -DEC. 23, 1936 149
b) Qui sera intervenu d'une manière unilatérale ou illégale dans les affaires intérieures ou étrangères d'un autre Etat ;
c) Qui se sera refusé à accomplir une sentence arbitrale ou une sentence de la justice internationale, légalement rendue.
Aucune considération d'ordre politique, militaire, économique ou d'un autre ordre, ne pourra servir d'excuse ou de justification à l'agression ici prévue.

Knowing that the general welfare will be greater when there is greater facility for the exchange of the products of said countries ;

Los mismos estudiantes no deberán ser designados durante más de dos años consecutivos y, excepto en casos excepcionales, para más de un año . Ningún país estará obligado a considerar la nómina de cualquier otro país si no ha sido formada y presentada con anterioridad a la fecha estatuída al final de este artículo, y las becas para las cuales no se hubiere presentado una nómina con anterioridad a la fecha fijada, podrán ser otorgadas a solicitantes indicados en las nóminas de cualquier otro país, que no hayan recibido becas.
Salvo que los países interesados convengan otra cosa, regirán las siguientes fechas:
Países de América del Sur, 30 de noviembre , y los demás países, 31 de marzo .

debiendo entenderse, sin embargo, que se dará preferencia a la obra de enseñanza más bien que a la labor de investigación. El Gobierno que envía al profesor visitante cubrirá sus gastos de viaje de ida y vuelta a la ciudad donde resida y los gastos de mantenimiento y de viajes locales mientras el profesor desempeñe las funciones para las que fué escogido . El sueldo de los profesores será pagado por el país que los envía .

Art.

Art. VIII.- La presente Convención no afecta los compromisos contraídos anteriormente por las Altas Partes Contratantes en virtud de acuerdos internacionales .
Art . IX.- La presente Convención será ratificada por las Altas Partes Contratantes, de acuerdo con sus procedimientos constitucionales.

Transcurrido este plazo, la Convención cesará en sus efectos para el denunciante, quedando subsistente para las demás Altas Partes Contratantes .
En fe de lo cual, los Plenipotenciarios arriba mencionados , firman y sellan la presente Convención en español, inglés, portugués y francés, en la ciudad de Buenos Aires, Capital de la República Argentina, a los veintitrés días del mes de diciembre del año mil novecientos treinta y seis.

Ces derniers choisiront deux noms sur ladite liste. Les mêmes étudiants ne pourront pas être désignés pendant plus de deux ans consécutifs, et, sauf dans les cas exceptionnels , pour plus d'un an. Aucun pays ne sera obligé de prende en considération la liste d'un autre pays si elle n'a pas été établie et présentée antérieurement à la date fixée à la fin du
présent article , et les bourses pour lesquelles n'aurait pas été présentée une liste antérieurement à la date établie, pourront être concédées aux personnes indiquées sur les listes de n'importe quel autre pays, qui n'aurait pas eu de bourse.
Sauf dans le cas où les pays intéressés en conviendraient autrement, les dates suivantes régiront : pays de l'Amérique du Sud: 30 Novembre; autres pays: 31 Mars.
Article III. Si pour n'importe quel motif il était nécessaire de rapatrier un étudiant, le Gouvernement qui accorde la bourse pourrait effectuer le rapatriement pour compte du Gouvernement qui avait désigné l'étudiant.

Le Gouvernement qui envoie le professeur visiteur paiera ses frais de voyage (aller et retour ) jusqu'à la ville où il résidera ainsi que les
frais d'entretien et de voyages locaux pendant que le professeur remplira les fonctions pour lesquelles il a été désigné. Le traitement des professeurs sera payé par le pays qui les enverra.
Article V.- Les Hautes Parties Contractantes conviennent que chaque Gouvernement désignera ou créera un organe approprié, ou désignera un fonctionnaire spécial qui aura la responsabilité de mettre en pratique, de la façon la plus efficace possible, les obligations assumées par ce Gouvernement, en vertu de cette Convention.

Article VII.- Dans chacun des pays contractants et par l'intermédiaire de l'organe que l'on jugera approprié, on établira des règlements relativement aux détails qui seraient jugés nécessaires, et, avec l'anticipation voulue, on fournira des copies de ces règlements par la voie diplomatique, aux Gouvernements des autres Hautes Parties Contractantes .

INTER-AMERICAN-CULTURAL RELATIONS- DECEMBER 23, 1936

Lesquels, à ce dûment autorisés , sont convenus de ce qui suit :
ARTICLE PREMIER .
Dans la présente Convention les mots suivants sont employés dans le sens précis indiqué ci-dessous :
(a) «Transporteur » comprend le propriétaire du navire ou l'affréteur, partie à un contrat de transport avec un chargeur.
(b) « Contrat de transport » s'applique uniquement au contrat de transport constaté par un connaissement ou par tout document similaire formant titre pour le transport des marchandises par mer ; il s'applique également au connaissement ou document similaire émis en vertu d'une charte -partie à partir du moment où ce titre régit les rapports du transporteur et du porteur du connaissement.
(c ) « Marchandises » comprend biens , objets , marchandises et articles de nature quelconque , à l'exception des animaux vivants et de la cargaison qui , par le contrat de transport , est déclarée comme mise sur le pont et, en fait, est ainsi transportée .
(d ) « Navire » signifie tout bâtiment employé pour le transport des marchandises par mer.
(e) «Transport de marchandises » couvre le temps écoulé depuis le chargement des marchandises à bord du navire jusqu'à leur déchargement du navire .
ARTICLE 2 . Sous réserve des dispositions de l'article 6 , le transporteur dans tous les contrats de transport des marchandises par mer sera, quant au chargement , à la manutention, à l'arrimage, au transport, à la garde , aux soins et au déchargement des dites marchandises, soumis aux responsabilités et obligations , comme il bénéficiera des droits et exonérations ci-dessous énoncés .

235

236

TREATIES
ARTICLE 3.
1. Le transporteur sera tenu avant et au début du voyage d'exercer une diligence raisonnable pour:
(a) Mettre le navire en état de navigabilité ; (b) Convenablement armer , équiper et approvisionner le navire ; (c) Approprier et mettre en bon état les cales, chambres froides et frigorifiques et toutes autres parties du navire où des marchandises sont chargées pour leur réception , transport et conservation. 2. Le transporteur , sous réserve des dispositions de l'article 4 , procédera de façon appropriée et soigneuse au chargement , à la manutention , à l'arrimage , au transport, à la garde , aux soins et au déchargement des marchandises transportées. 3. Après avoir reçu et pris en charge les marchandises , le transporteur ou le capitaine ou agent du transporteur devra, sur demande du chargeur, délivrer au chargeur un connaissement portant entre autres choses: (a) Les marques principales nécessaires à l'identification des marchandises telles qu'elles sont fournies par écrit par le chargeur avant que le chargement de ces marchandises ne commence, pourvu que ces marques soient imprimées ou apposées clairement de toute autre façon sur les marchandises non emballées ou sur les caisses ou emballages dans lesquelles les marchandises sont contenues, de telle sorte qu'elles devraient normalement rester lisibles jusqu'à la fin du voyage ; (b) Ou le nombre de colis , ou de pièces, ou la quantité ou le poids, suivant les cas, tels qu'ils sont fournis par écrit par le chargeur ; (c) L'état et le conditionnement apparent des marchandises . Cependant aucun transporteur, capitaine ou agent du transporteur, ne sera tenu de déclarer ou de mentionner, dans le connaissement des marques, un nombre, une quantité ou un poids, dont il a une raison sérieuse de soupçonner qu'ils ne représentent pas exactement les marchandises actuellement reçues par lui, ou qu'il n'a pas eu des moyens raisonnables de vérifier. 4. Un tel connaissement vaudra présomption , sauf preuve contraire, de la réception par le transporteur des marchandises telles qu'elles y sont décrites conformément au § 3, a) , b) et c) . 5. Le chargeur sera considéré avoir garanti au transporteur, au moment du chargement, l'exactitude des marques , du nombre , de la quantité et du poids tels qu'ils sont fournis par lui , et le chargeur indemnisera le transporteur de toutes pertes, dommages et dépenses provenant ou résultant d'inexactitudes sur ces points. Le droit du transporteur à pareille indemnité ne limitera d'aucune façon sa responsabilité et ses engagements sous l'empire du contrat de transport vis-à-vis de toute personne autre que le chargeur. 6. A moins qu'un avis des pertes ou dommages et de la nature générale de ces pertes ou dommages ne soit donné par écrit au transporteur où à son agent au port de déchargement, avant ou au moment de l'enlèvement des marchandises , et de leur remise sous la garde de la personne ayant droit à la délivrance sous l'empire du contrat de

MULTILATERAL - BILLS OF LADING- AUGUST 25, 1924
transport , cet enlèvement constituera , jusqu'à preuve contraire , une présomption que les marchandises ont été délivrées par le transporteur telles qu'elles sont décrites au connaissement.
Si les pertes ou dommages ne sont pas apparents , l'avis doit être donné dans les trois jours de la délivrance .
Les réserves écrites sont inutiles si l'état de la marchandise a été contradictoirement constaté au moment de la réception.
En tous cas le transporteur et le navire seront déchargés de toute responsabilité pour pertes ou dommages à moins qu'une action ne soit. intentée dans l'année de la délivrance des marchandises ou de la date à laquelle elles eussent dû être délivrées .
En cas de perte ou dommage certains ou présumés, le transporteur et le réceptionnaire se donneront réciproquement toutes les facilités raisonnables pour l'inspection de la marchandise et la vérification du nombre de colis .
7. Lorsque les marchandises auront été chargées, le connaissement que délivrera le transporteur, capitaine ou agent du transporteur, au chargeur sera, si le chargeur le demande, un connaissement libellé «Embarqué» pourvu que, si le chargeur a auparavent reçu quelque document donnant droit à ces marchandises , il restitue ce document contre remise d'un connaissement «Embarqué» . Le transporteur , le capitaine ou l'agent aura également la faculté d'annoter au port d'embarquement, sur le document remis en premier lieu , le ou les noms du ou des navires sur lesquels les marchandises ont été embarquées et la date ou les dates de l'embarquement, et lorsque ce document sera ainsi annoté, il sera, s'il contient les mentions de l'article 3 , § 3 , considéré aux fins de cet article comme constituant un connaissement libellé «Embarqué».
8. Toute clause , convention ou accord dans un contrat de transport exonérant le transporteur ou le navire de responsabilité pour perte ou dommage concernant des marchandises provenant de négligence , faute ou manquement aux devoirs ou obligations édictées dans cet article ou atténuant cette responsabilité autrement que ne le prescrit la présente Convention, sera nulle, non avenue et sans effet . Une clause cédant le bénéfice de l'assurance au transporteur ou toute clause semblable sera considérée comme exonérant le transporteur de sa responsabilité.
ARTICLE 4.
1. Ni le transporteur ni le navire ne seront responsables des pertes ou dommages provenant ou résultant de l'état d'innavigabilité, à moins qu'il ne soit imputable à un manque de diligence raisonnable de la part du transporteur à mettre le navire en état de navigabilité ou à assurer au navire un armement, équipement ou approvisionnement convenables, ou à approprier et mettre en bon état les cales , chambres froides et frigorifiques et toutes autres parties du navire où des marchandises sont chargées, de façon qu'elles soient aptes à la réception, au transport et à la préservation des marchandises, le tout conformément aux prescriptions de l'article 3 , § 1er. Toutes les fois qu'une perte ou un dommage aura résulté de l'innavigabilité, le fardeau de la

237

238

TREATIES
preuve en ce qui concerne l'exercice de la diligence raisonnable tombera sur le transporteur ou sur toute autre personne se prévalant de l'exonération prévue au présent article.
2. Ni le transporteur ni le navire ne seront responsables pour perte ou dommage résultant ou provenant :
(a) Des actes , négligence ou défaut du capitaine, marin , pilote ou des préposés du transporteur dans la navigation ou dans l'administration du navire ;
(b) D'un incendie , à moins qu'il ne soit causé par le fait ou la faute du transporteur ;
(c ) Des périls, dangers ou accidents de la mer ou d'autres eaux navigables ;
(d) D'un « acte de Dieu » ; (e) De faits de guerre ; (f) Du fait d'ennemis publics ; (g) D'un arrèt ou contrainte de prince, autorités ou peuple, ou d'une saisie judiciaire ; (h) D'une restriction de quarantaine ; (i) D'un acte ou d'une omission du chargeur ou propriétaire des marchandises , de son agent ou représentant ; (j ) De grèves ou lock-outs ou d'arrêts ou entraves apportés au travail, pour quelque cause que ce soit , partiellement ou complètement ; (k) D'émeutes ou de troubles civils ; (1 ) D'un sauvetage ou tentative de sauvetage de vies ou de biens en mer ; (m) De la freinte en volume ou en poids ou de toute autre perte ou dommage résultant de vice caché, nature spéciale ou vice propre de la marchandise ; (n) D'une insuffisance d'emballage ; (0) D'une insuffisance ou imperfection de marques ; (p) De vices cachés échappant à une diligence raisonnable ; (q) De toute autre cause ne provenant pas du fait ou de la faute du transporteur ou du fait ou de la faute des agents ou préposés du transporteur, mais le fardeau de la preuve incombera à la personne réclamant le bénéfice de cette exception et il lui appartiendra de montrer que ni la faute personnelle ni le fait du transporteur ni la faute ou le fait des agents ou préposés du transporteur n'ont contribué à la perte ou au dommage . 3. Le chargeur ne sera pas responsable des pertes ou dommages subis par le transporteur ou le navire et qui proviendraient ou résulteraient de toute cause quelconque sans qu'il y ait acte, faute ou négligence du chargeur , de ses agents ou de ses préposés. 4. Aucun déroutement pour sauver ou tenter de sauver des vies ou des biens en mer , ni aucun déroutement raisonnable ne sera considéré comme une infraction à la présente Convention ou au contrat de transport, et le transporteur ne sera responsable d'aucune perte ou dommage en résultant. 5. Le transporteur comme le navire ne seront tenus en aucun cas des pertes ou dommages causés aux marchandises ou les concernant

MULTILATERAL- BILLS OF LADING -AUGUST 25, 1924
pour une somme dépassant 100 liv. sterl . par colis ou unité , ou l'équivalent de cette somme en une autre monnaie , à moins que la nature et la valeur de ces marchandises n'aient été déclarées par le chargeur avant leur embarquement et que cette déclaration ait été insérée au connaissement .
Cette déclaration ainsi insérée dans le connaissement constituera
une présomption , sauf preuve contraire, mais elle ne liera pas le transporteur, qui pourra la contester .
Par convention entre le transporteur, capitaine ou agent du transporteur et le chargeur, une somme maximum différente de celle inscrite dans ce paragraphe peut être déterminée, pourvu que ce maximum conventionnel ne soit pas inférieur au chiffre ci-dessus fixé.
Ni le transporteur ni le navire ne seront en aucun cas responsables pour perte ou dommage causé aux marchandises ou les concernant, si dans le connaissement le chargeur a fait sciemment une déclaration fausse de leur nature ou de leur valeur.
6. Les marchandises de nature inflammable, explosive ou dangereuse, à l'embarquement desquelles le transporteur , le capitaine ou l'agent du transporteur n'auraient pas consenti, en connaissant leur nature ou leur caractère, pourront à tout moment, avant déchargement, être débarquées à tout endroit ou détruites ou rendues inoffensives par le transporteur sans indemnité et le chargeur de ces marchandises sera responsable de tout dommage et dépenses provenant ou résultant directement ou indirectement de leur embarquement . Si quelqu'une de ces marchandises embarquées à la connaissance et avec le consentement du transporteur devenait un danger pour le navire ou la cargaison , elle pourrait de même façon être débarquée ou détruite ou rendue inoffensive par le transporteur, sans responsabilité de la part du transporteur si ce n'est du chef d'avaries communes, s'il y a lieu .
ARTICLE 5.
Un transporteur sera libre d'abandonner tout ou partie de ses droits et exonérations ou d'augmenter ses responsabilités et obligations tels que les uns et les autres sont prévus par la présente Convention , pourvu que cet abandon ou cette augmentation soit inséré dans le connaissement délivré au chargeur.
Aucune disposition de la présente Convention ne s'applique aux chartes-parties ; mais si des connaissements sont émis dans le cas d'un navire sous l'empire d'une charte-partie, ils sont soumis aux termes de la présente Convention. Aucune disposition dans ces règles ne sera considérée comme empêchant l'insertion dans un connaissement d'une disposition licite quelconque ou sujet d'avaries communes.
ARTICLE 6 .
Nonobstant les dispositions des articles précédents, un transporteur, capitaine ou agent du transporteur et un chargeur seront libres , pour des marchandises déterminées , quelles qu'elles soient , de passer un contrat quelconque avec des conditions quelconques concernant la responsabilité et les obligations du transporteur pour ces marchan-

239

240

dises , ainsi que les droits et exonérations du transporteur au sujet de ces mêmes marchandises , ou concernant ses obligations quant à l'état de navigabilité du navire dans la mesure où cette stipulation n'est pas contraire à l'ordre public, ou concernant les soins ou diligence de ses préposés ou agents quant au chargement, à la manutention , à l'arrimage, au transport , à la garde , aux soins et au déchargement des marchandises transportées par mer, pourvu qu'en ce cas aucun connaissement n'ait été ou ne soit émis et que les conditions de l'accord intervenu soient insérées dans un récépissé qui sera un document non négociable et portera mention de ce caractère.
Toute convention ainsi conclue aura plein effet légal . Il est toutefois convenu que cet article ne s'appliquera pas aux cargaisons commerciales ordinaires, faites au cours d'opérations commerciales ordinaires , mais seulement à d'autres chargements où le caractère et la condition des biens à transporter et les circonstances , les termes et les conditions auxquels le transport doit se faire sont de nature à justifier une convention spéciale .

ARTICLE 7.

Aucune disposition de la présente Convention ne défend à un trans-

porteur ou à un chargeur d'insérer dans un contrat des stipulations,

conditions, réserves ou exonérations relatives aux obligations et

responsabilités du transporteur ou du navire pour la perte ou les

dommages survenant aux marchandises , ou concernant leur garde,

soin et manutention , antérieurement au chargement et postérieure-

ment au déchargement du navire sur lequel les marchandises sont

transportées par mer.

ARTICLE 8 .

Les dispositions de la présente Convention ne modifient ni les droits ni les obligations du transporteur tels qu'ils résultent de toute loi en vigueur en ce moment relativement à la limitation de la responsabilité des propriétaires de navires de mer.

ARTICLE 9 .

Les unités monétaires dont il s'agit dans la présente Convention s'entendent valeur or.
Ceux des Etats contractants où la livre sterling n'est pas employée comme unité monétaire se réservent le droit de convertir en chiffres ronds, d'après leur système monétaire , les sommes indiquées en livres sterling dans la présente Convention .
Les lois nationales peuvent réserver au débiteur la faculté de se libérer dans la monnaie nationale, d'après le cours du change au jour de l'arrivée du navire au port de déchargement de la marchandise dont il s'agit.
ARTICLE 10.

Les dispositions de la présente Convention s'appliqueront à tout connaissement créé dans un des Etats contractants.

MULTILATERAL- BILLS OF LADING - AUGUST 25, 1924
ARTICLE 11 .
A l'expiration du délai de deux ans au plus tard à compter du jour de la signature de la Convention , le Gouvernement belge entrera en rapport avec les Gouvernements des Hautes Parties contractantes qui se seront déclarées prêtes à la ratifier, à l'effet de faire décider s'il y a lieu de la mettre en vigueur .

Dans les cas visés à l'alinéa précédent, ledit Gouvernement fera connaître, en même temps , la date à laquelle il a reçu la notification .
ARTICLE 12 .

En conséquence , elles peuvent ultérieurement adhérer séparément au nom de l'un ou de l'autre de ces Dominions autonomes , colonies, possessions , protectorats ou territoires d'outre-mer, ainsi exclus dans leur déclaration originale .

riage of goods by sea to or from ports of the United States, in foreign trade, shall have effect subject to the provisions of this Act.

1 Public, No. 521 , 74th Cong., 49 Stat. 1207.

MULTILATERAL- BILLS OF LADING-AUGUST 25, 1924
(b) The term "contract of carriage" applies only to contracts of carriage covered by a bill of lading or any similar document of title , insofar as such document relates to the carriage of goods by sea, including any bill of lading or any similar document as aforesaid issued under or pursuant to a charter party from the moment at which such bill of lading or similar document of title regulates the relations between a carrier and a holder of the same.
(c ) The term "goods" includes goods, wares, merchandise , and articles of every kind whatsoever, except live animals and cargo which by the contract of carriage is stated as being carried on deck and is so carried .
(d) The term "ship" means any vessel used for the carriage of goods by sea.
(e) The term "carriage of goods" covers the period from the time when the goods are loaded on to the time when they are discharged from the ship .
RISKS
SEC. 2. Subject to the provisions of section 6 , under every contract of carriage of goods by sea, the carrier in relation to the loading, handling, stowage, carriage, custody, care, and discharge of such goods, shall be subject to the responsibilities and liabilities and entitled to the rights and immunities hereinafter set forth .
RESPONSIBILITIES AND LIABILITIES
SEC . 3. ( 1 ) The carrier shall be bound , before and at the beginning of the voyage, to exercise due diligence to-
(a ) Make the ship seaworthy ; (b) Properly man , equip , and supply the ship ; (c) Make the holds, refrigerating and cooling chambers , and all other parts of the ship in which goods are carried , fit and safe for their reception, carriage, and preservation. (2) The carrier shall properly and carefully load, handle , stow, carry, keep, care for, and discharge the goods carried . (3 ) After receiving the goods into his charge the carrier, or the master or agent of the carrier, shall, on demand of the shipper, issue to the shipper a bill of lading showing among other things(a) The leading marks necessary for identification of the goods as the same are furnished in writing by the shipper before the loading of such goods starts , provided such marks are stamped or otherwise shown clearly upon the goods if uncovered , or on the cases or coverings in which such goods are contained, in such a manner as should ordinarily remain legible until the end of the voyage. (b) Either the number of packages or pieces, or the quantity or weight, as the case may be, as furnished in writing by the shipper. (c) The apparent order and condition of the goods : Provided, That no carrier, master, or agent of the carrier, shall be bound to state or show in the bill of lading any marks, number, quantity, or weight which he has reasonable ground for suspecting not accurately

263

264

TREATIES
to represent the goods actually received , or which he has had no reasonable means of checking .
(4 ) Such a bill of lading shall be prima facie evidence of the receipt by the carrier of the goods as therein described in accordance with paragraphs (3 ) (a) , (b) , and (c), of this section : Provided, That nothing in this Act shall be construed as repealing or limiting the application of any part of the Act , as amended , entitled "An Act relating to bills of lading in interstate and foreign commerce" , approved August 29 , 1916 (U. S. C. , title 49 , secs . 81-124 ) , commonly known as the "Pomerene Bills of Lading Act."
(5 ) The shipper shall be deemed to have guaranteed to the carrier the accuracy at the time of shipment of the marks, number, quantity , and weight, as furnished by him ; and the shipper shall indemnify the carrier against all loss, damages, and expenses arising or resulting from inaccuracies in such particulars. The right of the carrier to such indemnity shall in no way limit his responsibility and liability under the contract of carriage to any person other than the shipper .
(6 ) Unless notice of loss or damage and the general nature of such loss or damage be given in writing to the carrier or his agent at the port of discharge before or at the time of the removal of the goods into the custody of the person entitled to delivery thereof under the contract of carriage, such removal shall be prima facie evidence of the delivery by the carrier of the goods as described in the bill of lading . If the loss or damage is not apparent, the notice must be given within three days of the delivery .
Said notice of loss or damage may be endorsed upon the receipt for the goods given by the person taking delivery thereof.
The notice in writing need not be given if the state of the goods has at the time of their receipt been the subject of joint survey or inspection .
In any event the carrier and the ship shall be discharged from all liability in respect of loss or damage unless suit is brought within one year after delivery of the goods or the date when the goods should have been delivered : Provided, That if a notice of loss or damage, either apparent or concealed , is not given as provided for in this section, that fact shall not affect or prejudice the right of the shipper to bring suit within one year after the delivery of the goods or the date when the goods should have been delivered .
In the case of any actual or apprehended loss or damage the carrier and the receiver shall give all reasonable facilities to each other for inspecting and tallying the goods .
(7) After the goods are loaded the bill of lading to be issued by the carrier, master, or agent of the carrier to the shipper shall , if the shipper so demands, be a "shipped " bill of lading : Provided , That if the shipper shall have previously taken up any document of title to such goods, he shall surrender the same as against the issue of the "shipped " bill of lading, but at the option of the carrier such document of title may be noted at the port of shipment by the carrier, master, or agent with the name or names of the ship or ships

MULTILATERAL- BILLS OF LADING- AUGUST 25, 1924
upon which the goods have been shipped and the date or dates of shipment, and when so noted the same shall for the purpose of this section be deemed to constitute a "shipped" bill of lading.
(8) Any clause, covenant, or agreement in a contract of carriage relieving the carrier or the ship from liability for loss or damage to or in connection with the goods, arising from negligence, fault, or failure in the duties and obligations provided in this section, or lessening such liability otherwise than as provided in this Act, shall be null and void and of no effect. A benefit of insurance in favor of the carrier, or similar clause, shall be deemed to be a clause relieving the carrier from liability.
RIGHTS AND IMMUNITIES
SEC. 4. ( 1 ) Neither the carrier nor the ship shall be liable for loss or damage arising or resulting from unseaworthiness unless caused by want of due diligence on the part of the carrier to make the ship seaworthy, and to secure that the ship is properly manned , equipped , and supplied, and to make the holds, refrigerating and cool chambers, and all other parts of the ship in which goods are carried fit and safe for their reception , carriage, and preservation in accordance with the provisions of paragraph ( 1 ) of section 3. Whenever loss or damage has resulted from unseaworthiness, the burden of proving the exercise of due diligence shall be on the carrier or other persons claiming exemption under this section .
(2) Neither the carrier nor the ship shall be responsible for loss or damage arising or resulting from-
(a) Act, neglect, or default of the master, mariner, pilot , or the servants of the carrier in the navigation or in the management of the ship ;
(b) Fire, unless caused by the actual fault or privity of the carrier ; (c) Perils, dangers, and accidents of the sea or other navigable waters ; (d) Act of God ; (e) Act of war ; (f) Act of public enemies ; (g) Arrest or restraint of princes, rulers, or people, or seizure under legal process ; (h) Quarantine restrictions ; (i ) Act or omission of the shipper or owner of the goods , his agent or representative ; (j ) Strikes or lockouts or stoppage or restraint of labor from whatever cause, whether partial or general : Provided, that nothing herein contained shall be construed to relieve a carrier from responsibility for the carrier's own acts ; (k) Riots and civil commotions ; (1) Saving or attempting to save life or property at sea; (m) Wastage in bulk or weight or any other loss or damage arising from inherent defect, quality, or vice of the goods ; (n) Insufficiency of packing ;

265

266

TREATIES
(0) Insufficiency or inadequacy of marks ; (p) Latent defects not discoverable by due diligence ; and (q ) Any other cause arising without the actual fault and privity of the carrier and without the fault or neglect of the agents or servants of the carrier, but the burden of proof shall be on the person claiming the benefit of this exception to show that neither the actual fault or privity of the carrier nor the fault or neglect of the agents or servants of the carrier contributed to the loss or damage. (3) The shipper shall not be responsible for loss or damage sustained by the carrier or the ship arising or resulting from any cause without the act, fault, or neglect of the shipper, his agents, or his servants . (4 ) Any deviation in saving or attempting to save life or property at sea, or any reasonable deviation shall not be deemed to be an infringement or breach of this Act or of the contract of carriage, and the carrier shall not be liable for any loss or damage resulting therefrom: Provided, however, That if the deviation is for the purpose of loading or unloading cargo or passengers it shall, prima facie, be regarded as unreasonable. (5) Neither the carrier nor the ship shall in any event be or become liable for any loss or damage to or in connection with the transportation of goods in an amount exceeding $ 500 per package lawful money of the United States, or in case of goods not shipped in packages , per customary freight unit, or the equivalent of that sum in other currency, unless the nature and value of such goods have been declared by the shipper before shipment and inserted in the bill of lading. This declaration, if embodied in the bill of lading, shall be prima facie evidence, but shall not be conclusive on the carrier. By agreement between the carrier, master, or agent of the carrier, and the shipper another maximum amount than that mentioned in this paragraph may be fixed: Provided, That such maximum shall not be less than the figure above named . In no event shall the carrier be liable for more than the amount of damage actually sustained . Neither the carrier nor the ship shall be responsible in any event for loss or damage to or in connection with the transportation of the goods if the nature or value thereof has been knowingly and fraudulently misstated by the shipper in the bill of lading. (6) Goods of an inflammable, explosive, or dangerous nature to the shipment whereof the carrier, master or agent of the carrier, has not consented with knowledge of their nature and character, may at any time before discharge be landed at any place or destroyed or rendered innocuous by the carrier without compensation, and the shipper of such goods shall be liable for all damages and expenses directly or indirectly arising out of or resulting from such shipment. If any such goods shipped with such knowledge and consent shall become a danger to the ship or cargo, they may in like manner be landed at any place, or destroyed or rendered innocuous by the carrier without liability on the part of the carrier except to general average, if any.

MULTILATERAL- BILLS OF LADING- AUGUST 25, 1924
SURRENDER OF RIGHTS AND IMMUNITIES AND INCREASE OF RESPONSIBILITIES AND LIABILITIES
SEC. 5. A carrier shall be at liberty to surrender in whole or in part all or any of his rights and immunities or to increase any of his responsibilities and liabilities under this Act, provided such surrender or increase shall be embodied in the bill of lading issued to the shipper.
The provisions of this Act shall not be applicable to charter parties ; but if bills of lading are issued in the case of a ship under a charter party, they shall comply with the terms of this Act. Nothing in this Act shall be held to prevent the insertion in a bill of lading of any lawful provision regarding general average.
SPECIAL CONDITIONS
SEC. 6. Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding sections, a carrier, master or agent of the carrier, and a shipper shall , in regard to any particular goods be at liberty to enter into any agreement in any terms as to the responsibility and liability of the carrier for such goods, and as to the rights and immunities of the carrier in respect of such goods, or his obligation as to seaworthiness (so far as the stipulation regarding seaworthiness is not contrary to public policy) , or the care or diligence of his servants or agents in regard to the loading, handling, stowage, carriage, custody, care, and discharge of the goods carried by sea: Provided, That in this case no bill of lading has been or shall be issued and that the terms agreed shall be embodied in a receipt which shall be a nonnegotiable document and shall be marked as such.
Any agreement so entered into shall have full legal effect: Provided, That this section shall not apply to ordinary commercial shipments made in the ordinary course of trade but only to other shipments where the character or condition of the property to be carried or the circumstances, terms , and conditions under which the carriage is to be performed are such as reasonably to justify a special agreement.
SEC. 7. Nothing contained in this Act shall prevent a carrier or a shipper from entering into any agreement, stipulation, condition, reservation, or exemption as to the responsibility and liability of the carrier or the ship for the loss or damage to or in connection with the custody and care and handling of goods prior to the loading on and subsequent to the discharge from the ship on which the goods are carried by sea.
SEC. 8. The provisions of this Act shall not affect the rights and obligations of the carrier under the provisions of the Shipping Act, 1916, or under the provisions of sections 4281 to 4289 , inclusive, of the Revised Statutes of the United States , or of any amendments thereto ; or under the provisions of any other enactment for the time being in force relating to the limitation of the liability of the owners of seagoing vessels .

TITLE II
SECTION 9. Nothing contained in this Act shall be construed as permitting a common carrier by water to discriminate between competing shippers similarly placed in time and circumstances , either (a) with respect to their right to demand and receive bills of lading subject to the provisions of this Act ; or (b ) when issuing such bills of lading, either in the surrender of any of the carrier's rights and immunities or in the increase of any of the carrier's responsibilities and liabilities pursuant to section 5 , title I , of this Act ; or (c) in any other way prohibited by the Shipping Act, 1916 , as amended .
SEC. 10. Section 25 of the Interstate Commerce Act is hereby amended by adding the following proviso at the end of paragraph 4 thereof: "Provided, however, That insofar as any bill of lading authorized hereunder relates to the carriage of goods by sea, such bill of lading shall be subject to the provisions of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act."
SEC. 11. Where under the customs of any trade the weight of any bulk cargo inserted in the bill of lading is a weight ascertained or accepted by a third party other than the carrier or the shipper, and the fact that the weight is so ascertained or accepted is stated in the bill of lading, then, notwithstanding anything in this Act, the bill of lading shall not be deemed to be prima facie evidence against the carrier of the receipt of goods of the weight so inserted in the bill of lading, and the accuracy thereof at the time of shipment shall not be deemed to have been guaranteed by the shipper.
SEC. 12. Nothing in this Act shall be construed as superseding any part of the Act entitled "An Act relating to navigation of vessels, bills of lading , and to certain obligations, duties, and rights in connection with the carriage of property", approved February 13 , 1893, or of any other law which would be applicable in the absence of this Act, insofar as they relate to the duties, responsibilities, and liabilities of the ship or carrier prior to the time when the goods are loaded on or after the time they are discharged from the ship.
SEC. 13. This Act shall apply to all contracts for carriage of goods by sea to or from ports of the United States in foreign trade . As used in this Act the term "United States" includes its districts, territories, and possessions : Provided, however, That the Philippine Legislature may by law exclude its application to transportation to or from ports of the Philippine Islands. The term "foreign trade" means the transportation of goods between the ports of the United States and ports of foreign countries . Nothing in this Act shall be held to apply to contracts for carriage of goods by sea between any port of the United States or its possessions, and any other port of the United States or its possessions : Provided , however, That any bill of lading or similar document of title which is evidence of a contract for the carriage of goods by sea between such ports, containing an express statement that it shall be subject to the provisions of this Act, shall be subjected hereto as fully as if subject

MULTILATERAL- BILLS OF LADING-- AUGUST 25, 1924

TREATIES
TITLE I
1. Section 3 , subsection (2 ) of the Act does not contain the words "Subject to the provisions of Article 4 " or their equivalent with which paragraph 2 of Article 3 of the Convention begins . The subsection, the words which are in the Convention but not in the act being placed in parentheses , is as follows:
"SEC . 3 . "(2 ) ("Subject to the provisions of Article 4 ) The carrier shall properly and carefully load , handle, stow, carry, keep, care for, and discharge the goods carried . "
2. Section 3 , subsection (4 ) of the Act contains a proviso which is not in the Convention reserving the Act relating to bills of lading in interstate and foreign commerce , approved August 29, 1916 (Pomerene Act). The proviso is underlined in the following quotation from the Act:
"SEC . 3. · "(4) Such a bill of lading shall be prima facie evidence of the receipt by the carrier of the goods as therein described in accordance with paragraphs (3 ) (a) , (b ) , and (c ) , of this section ; Provided, That nothing in this Act shall be construed as repealing or limiting the application of any part of the Act, as amended, entitled ' An Act relating to bills of lading in interstate andforeign commerce', approved August 29, 1916 (U. S. C. , title 49 , secs . 81-124) , commonly known as the 'Pomerene Bills of Lading Act." "
[This proviso is primarily for the protection of subsequent holders of bills of lading. Prior to the enactment of the Pomerene Act a number of cases had arisen in the United States in which shippers had induced representatives of common carriers to sign bills of lading receipting for goods on the shipper's assurance that the goods would later be delivered to the carrier. The shippers would then dispose of the bills of lading through the usual discounting procedure . Subsequently these shippers for various reasons sometimes failed to deliver the goods to the carrier. The courts in the United States held that the fact that the goods never came into the custody of the carrier was a good defense to relieve it of liability to the holder of the bill of lading. The Pomerene Act changed this law so as to place the liability under such situations on the carrier. ] 2
3. Section 3, subsection (6 ) of the Act contains a new paragraph, appearing as the second paragraph of the subsection , which is not in the Convention, providing that notice of loss or damage may be endorsed on the receipt given for the goods . The new paragraph is underlined in the following quotation from the Act :
"SEC. 3.. "(6) Unless notice of loss or damage and the general nature of such loss or damage be given in writing to the carrier or his agent at the port of discharge before or at the time of the removal of the goods into the custody of the person entitled to delivery thereof under the contract of carriage, such removal shall be prima facie evidence of the
1 Italicized . 2 Brackets appear on original memorandum.

MULTILATERAL- BILLS OF LADING- AUGUST 25, 1924
delivery by the carrier of the goods as described in the bill of lading. If the loss or damage is not apparent, the notice must be given within three days of the delivery .
"Said notice of loss or damage may be endorsed upon the receipt for the goods given by the person taking delivery thereof."
4. The fourth paragraph of Section 3, subsection (6 ) of the Act contains a proviso which is not in the Convention to the effect that in all cases suit may be brought within one year. The proviso is
1 underlined in the following quotation from the Act:
"SEC . 3. "(6) .. "In any event the carrier and the ship shall be discharged from all liability in respect of loss or damage unless suit is brought within one year after delivery of the goods or the date when the goods should have been delivered : Provided, That if a notice of loss or damage, either apparent or concealed, is not given as provided for in this section , that fact shall not affect or prejudice the right of the shipper to bring suit within one year after the delivery of the goods or the date when the goods should have been delivered."
5. The condition "if it shows the particulars mentioned in paragraph 3 of Article 3 " appearing near the end of paragraph 7 of Article 3 of the Convention is not in the Act. Section 3 , subsection 7 , of the Act, the language which is in the Convention but not in the Act being placed in parentheses , is as follows:
"SECTION 3. . . "7. After the goods are loaded the bill of lading to be issued by the carrier, master, or agent of the carrier to the shipper shall , if the shipper so demands, be a ' shipped' bill of lading ; Provided that if the shipper shall have previously taken up any document of title to such goods, he shall surrender the same as against the issue of the ' shipped' bill of lading, but at the option of the carrier such document of title may be noted at the port of shipment by the carrier, master, or agent with the name or names of the ship or ships upon which the goods have been shipped and the date or dates of shipment , and when so noted , (if it shows the particulars mentioned in paragraph 3 of Article 3 , ) the same shall for the purpose of this section be deemed to constitute a ' shipped ' bill of lading .'
6. Section 4 , subsection (2 ) (j ) of the Act contains a proviso which is not in the Convention affirming the responsibility of the carrier for his own acts in strikes, lockouts , et cetera. The proviso is underlined in the following quotation from the Act:
"SEC. 4 . "(2 ) Neither the carrier nor the ship shall be responsible for loss or damage arising or resulting from--
"(j) Strikes or lockouts or stoppage or restraint of labor from whatever cause, whether partial or general Provided, That nothing herein contained shall be construed to relieve a carrier from responsi bility for the carrier's own acts;"

TREATIES
7. Section 4, Subsection 2 (q) of the Act differs from Article 4 , paragraph 2 (q ) of the Convention in that the word "and" is used at two places near the beginning of the paragraph in the Act where "or" is used in the Convention. Section 4, subsection (2 ) ( q ) of the Act is as follows:
"SEC . 4. . . . "(2) Neither the carrier nor the ship shall be responsible for loss or damage arising or resulting from--
"(q ) Any other cause arising without the actual fault (or) and privity of the carrier (or) and without the fault or neglect of the agents or servants of the carrier, but the burden of proof shall be on the person claiming the benefit of this exception to show that neither the actual fault or privity of the carrier nor the fault or neglect of the agents or servants of the carrier contributed to the loss or damage."
8. Section 4, subsection (4 ) of the Act contains a proviso which is not in the Convention to the effect that deviation for the purpose of loading or unloading cargo or passengers is prima facie unreasonable. The proviso is underlined ' in the following quotation from the Act :
"SEC . 4 . · "(4) Any deviation in saving or attempting to save life or property at sea, or any reasonable deviation shall not be deemed to be an infringement or breach of this Act or of the contract of carriage, and the carrier shall not be liable for any loss or damage resulting therefrom: Provided, however, That if the deviation is for the purpose of loading or unloading cargo or passengers it shall, prima facie, be regarded as unreasonable."
9. Section 4, subsection (5 ) of the Act contains phraseology in the first paragraph by which the reservation which the Senate made in giving its advice and consent to the ratification of the Convention substituting lawful money of the United States in place of "gold value " is adopted. In this subsection $ 500 is substituted for 100 pounds sterling pursuant to the privilege reserved by the Contracting States in the second paragraph of Article 9 of the Convention . The words "the transportation of" are used before "goods" near the beginning of the subsection, and the words "binding or" which appear in the Convention are omitted from the next sentence of this subsection. The language appearing in Section 4, subsection (5 ) of the Act, but not in Article 4 , paragraph 5 of the Convention, is underlined¹ and the words "binding or" are placed in parentheses in the following quotation from the Act :
"SEC. 4. .. " (5 ) Neither the carrier nor the ship shall in any event be or become liable for any loss or damage to or in connection with the transportation of goods in an amount exceeding $500 per package lawful money of the United States , or in case of goods not shipped in packages , per customary freight unit, or the equivalent of that sum in other currency, unless the nature and value of such goods have been declared by the shipper before shipment and inserted in the bill of lading. This declaration, if embodied in the bill of lading , shall be prima facie evidence , but shall not be (binding or) conclusive on the carrier." 1 Italicized .

MULTILATERAL- BILLS OF LADING - AUGUST 25, 1924
10. Section 4 , subsection (5) of the Act contains a sentence in the second paragraph which is not in the Convention to the effect that in no case shall the carrier be liable for more than the amount of damage actually sustained . The sentence is underlined in the following quotation from the Act:
"SEC. 4 . · · · "(5) "By agreement between the carrier, master, or agent of the carrier, and the shipper another maximum amount than that mentioned in this paragraph may be fixed: Provided, That such maximum shall not be less than the figure above named. In no event shall the carrier be liable for more than the amount of damage actually sustained."
11. Section 4 , subsection (5 ) last paragraph of the Act contains the phrases "the transportation of the" before "goods" and the words "and fraudulently" after "knowingly", which do not appear in the Convention. This paragraph of the Act, the expressions mentioned being underlined , ' reads as follows :
"SEC. 4. · "(5) ..
"Neither the carrier nor the ship shall be responsible in any event for loss or damage to or in connection with the transportation of the goods if the nature or value thereof has been knowingly and fraudulently misstated by the shipper in the bill of lading."
12. In Section 8 of the Act reservations are made saving from the operation of the Act the provisions relating to the liability of the owners of seagoing vessels in certain Acts of the Congress of the United States , namely the Shipping Act of 1916 and sections 4281 to 4289 inclusive of the Revised Statutes of the United States or any amendments thereof, all of which this Government considers to be within the scope of the reservation in Article 8 of the Convention .
TITLE II
The provisions of Title II of the Act may be regarded as supplementary to the provisions of Title I , which, with the enacting clause taking the place of Article 10 , correspond to the first ten articles of the Convention .
The provisions of sections 9 , 11 and 12 in Title II of the Act are designed primarily to make clear that the provisions of Title I shall not be construed to affect certain features of American law and practice . Section 9 provides that a common carrier by water may not discriminate between competing shippers similarly placed in time and circumstance ; section 11 provides that where under the customs of any trade the weight of any bulk cargo inserted in a bill of lading was ascertained or accepted by a third party other than the carrier or the shipper, and that fact is stated in the bill of lading, the bill of lading shall not be deemed to be prima facie evidence against the
1 Italicized.

274

TREATIES
carrier as to the weight, and that the accuracy of the weight at the time of shipment shall not be deemed to have been guaranteed by the shipper ; section 12 provides that nothing in the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act shall supersede any part of the Act of the United States entitled "An Act relating to navigation of vessels , bills of lading and to certain obligations , duties, and rights in connection with the carriage of property," approved February 13, 1893 , (commonly known as "The Harter Act " ) , or of any other law which would be applicable in the absence of that Act, insofar as they relate to the duties, responsibilities and liabilities of the ship or carrier prior to the time when goods are loaded on or after the time they are discharged from the ship .
By section 10 an amendment is made to section 25 of the Interstate Commerce Act by adding at the end of paragraph 4 thereof a proviso to the effect that insofar as any bill of lading authorized under that paragraph relates to the carriage of goods by sea it shall be subject to the provisions of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act.
Section 13 provides in effect that the Act applies in respect of foreign trade of the United States , including the foreign trade of territories and possessions. This section also provides that the Act does not apply to contracts for the carriage of goods by sea between ports of the United States and between ports of the United States and its possessions, or between the latter, namely in coastwise trade, but the Section also provides for the recognition of express statements applying the provisions of the Act in shipments in such trade, when they are made in bills of lading.
By section 14 authority is conferred on the President to suspend on not less than ten days notice any or all of the provisions of Title I upon certification by the Secretary of Commerce that the foreign commerce of the United States in its competition with the commerce of foreign nations is prejudiced by the operation of any of the provisions of Title I of the Act or by the laws of any foreign country or countries relating to the carriage of goods by sea.
The foregoing differences from the Convention , made in the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, are intended primarily ( 1 ) to clarify provisions in the Convention which may be of uncertain meaning thereby avoiding expensive litigation in the United States for purposes of interpretation and (2) to coordinate the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act with other legislation of the United States.

No. 221

EMBASSY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,

Proposal for modification of decree.

EXCELLENCY :

Paris, February 18, 1937.

I have received Your Excellency's note enclosing a copy of the

decree of the French High Commissioner in Syria , No. 292/LR of

December 20, 1934 , which was destined to make precise the privileges

granted in the exchange of notes between M. Poincaré and Ambassador

Herrick, dated , respectively, November 2 , 1923 , and December 18

of the same year, ' for the American educational, religious and phil-

anthropic institutions in Syria and the Lebanon . I note that you invite the comment of my Government.
This matter has been made the subject of considerable corre-

spondence between the Embassy and the Ministry, and the Con-

43 Stat. 1821.

sulate General at Beirut and the High Commission, and my Government has always reserved the rights granted it by the Convention

between the United States of America and France regarding the

Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon, dated April 4, 1924 , and more

specifically mentioned in the exchange of notes above referred to , and

1 Not printed.

FRANCE-CUSTOMS , SYRIA AND THE LEBANON-FEB. 18, 1937
therefore will consider Decree No. 292/LR of December 20, 1934 , as an interpretation of the privileges granted , subject to two modifications:
First, the liberalization of the amounts to be imported free of duty by the American University of Beirut. The desire for this modification arises from the fact that scientific instruments, equipment for teaching, hospitals, etc. , which must all be imported by the University, create a proportion of importation relative to the number of students far higher than similar importations which might be required by secondary institutions and other foundations . Therefore , the creation of a special category for institutions of university standing might be in the public interest in the Mandated areas, particularly since devaluation has lessened the import value of the present allowances.
Second, it is suggested that, in case the American educational, religious and philanthropic institutions appeal from a decision of the customs inspectors, either as to amounts or classifications , no payment be made until the appeal shall have been heard and decided by the highest customs authorities. The reason which motivates this request is that appeals under the present régime tie up philanthropic funds for considerable lengths of time until decisions are acted upon, after which claims may be entered for the return of the money, and there is a long tie-up of funds destined entirely for eleemosynary purposes, as well as unnecessary administrative delay and inconvenience to both parties .
Should Your Excellency be able to consent to the two above mentioned modifications of Decree 292/LR of December 20, 1934, my Government will be most happy to consider the decree so modified as a satisfactory interpretation of the rights granted it by treaty and interpreted in the exchange of notes, by which it receives most favored nation treatment in this respect .
I avail myself of this occasion to renew to Your Excellency the assurance of my highest consideration,
WILLIAM C. BULLITT His Excellency

These charges ahll¹ not be cancelled even in case the parcel is returned to origin or reforwarded to another country.
2. If a parcel must be reforwarded to one of the two countries signatory to the present agreement, it is liable to new postage

charges, and, if occasion arises, new insurance fees, unless such

Kingdom of the Netherlands.

ARTICLE 1 .

Limits of weight and size.
Limits of weight 1. Parcels are admitted up to the weight of 20 kilograms (44 and sizes pounds) . They may not exceed the length of 1 meter 25 centimeters or 4 feet in any direction, nor have a volume greater than 113 cubic decimeters or 4 cubic feet.
2. In regard to the exact calculation of the weight, volume and dimensions, the indications furnished by the dispatching office will be accepted save in case of obvious error.
ARTICLE 2 .

Preparation of parcels.

1. The name and address of the sender and of the addressee must
be legibly and correctly written in every case on the parcel itself when possible, or on a label gummed thereto , and must also be written on a separate slip which slip must be enclosed in the package. Parcels will not be accepted when sent by or addressed to initials, unless the initials are the adopted trade name of the senders or addressees .

Preparation of parcels.

Addresses in ordinary pencil are not allowed , but copying ink or indelible pencil on a surface previously dampened may be used.
2. Each parcel must be packed in such a manner that the contents are protected over the whole route, and in such a way as to prevent the contents from damaging other parcels or objects or injuring postal agents. The packing must protect the contents sufficiently that, in case of rifling, the traces thereof may be easily discovered.
Ordinary parcels may be sealed at the option of the sender, or careful tying is sufficient as a mode of closing. Insured parcels must be sealed by means of wax, by lead or other seals.
As a protective measure, either Administration may require that a special imprint or mark of the sender appear on the wax or lead seals closing insured parcels.
The Customs Administration of the country of destination is authorized to open the parcels. To that end, the seals or any other fastenings may be broken. Parcels opened by the Customs must be refastened and also officially resealed .
3. Each insured parcel must be marked or labelled or stamped "Insured" or "Valeur déclarée" in a conspicuous manner on the address side, and in close proximity to such indorsement there must appear the insurance number given to the parcel. The dispatch note must also be marked or labelled or stamped "Insured" or "Valeur déclarée"

4. On the address side of each insured parcel there must be written, both in Arabic figures and in Roman letters, the amount for which the parcel is insured in the currency of the country of origin.

306

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES

This amount must be converted into gold francs by the sender or the office of origin and the result of the conversion must be added below the original inscription . The amount of the insured value must also be stated in the accompanying dispatch note.
5. The lables or postage stamps affixed to insured parcels must be spaced so that they cannot serve to conceal injuries to the packing. Neither may they be folded over two faces of the wrapping so as to cover the edge.
6. Liquids and easily liquefiable substances must be sent in a double receptacle. Between the first (bottle, flask, box, etc. ) and the second (box of metal, strong wood, or strong carton of fiberboard, or receptacle of equal strength) , there must be left a space to be filled with sawdust, bran or other absorbent material, in sufficient quantity to absorb all the liquid in case the receptacle is broken.
7. Powders and dyes in powder form must be packed in strong boxes of tin or other metal, which, after soldering, must be placed in turn in substantial outer covers in such a way as to avoid all damage to other articles.
ARTICLE 3.

its contents and value, date of mailing, the sender's name and address,

and the name and address of the addressee, and shall be securely attached to the parcel.

However, as an exception to the foregoing provision concerning customs declarations, when more than one parcel is mailed simul-

taneously by the same sender in one country to the same addressee at the same address in the other country, the sender need prepare only

one customs declaration for the entire shipment, in the case of parcels sent from the Kingdom of the Netherlands, and three customs declara-

tions for the entire shipment, in the case of parcels sent from the United States, which customs declarations shall show, in addition to

the particulars set forth in the preceding sentence, the total number

of parcels comprising the shipment, and shall be securely attached

to one of the parcels. The parcels comprising the entire shipment

shall be clearly marked in such case with a fractional number, the numerator of which will indicate, in Arabic figures, the number of the parcel and the denominator the number of parcels comprising the

shipment ; for example, if a single shipment were composed of 15

parcels, each parcel would be numbered , respectively, 1/15, 2/15, 3/15, etc.
2. The Administrations accept no responsibility for the correctness of the customs declarations.

ARTICLE 4.

Return receipts.

Return receipts.

7. The exact method of advising parcels or the receptacles containing them sent by one Administration in transit through the other together with any details of procedure in connection with the advice of such parcels or receptacles for which provision is not made in this agreement, shall be settled by mutual agreement through correspondence between the two Administrations.

ARTICLE 8 .

Verification by the exchange office.

Verification by ex-

change office.

1. Upon receipt of a dispatch, the exchange office of destination

proceeds to verify it. The entries in the parcel bill must be verified

exactly. Each error or omission must be brought immediately to the

knowledge of the dispatching exchange office by means of a bulletin

of verification. A dispatch is considered as having been found in

order in all regards when no bulletin of verification is made up .

If an error or irregularity is found upon receipt of a dispatch, all

objects which may serve later on for investigations, or for examina-

tion of requests for indemnity, must be kept.

2. The dispatching exchange office to which a bulletin of verification is sent returns it after having examined it and entered thereon

its observations, if any. That bulletin is then attached to the parcel

SIR:

Washington, March 2, 1937

I have the honour to refer to the Canadian Legation's Aide Me-
moire of January 7th, 1937 ,' and the Department of State's reply of January 19th 1 concerning the application of the Power City Broad-

casting Corporation and the Niagara Falls Gazette Publishing Com-

pany of Niagara Falls, New York, for permission to establish a

broadcasting station on a frequency of 630 kilocycles. This exchange

of correspondence dealt with the possible interference which might

be caused by the proposed station at Niagara Falls to Station CFCO

operating on a frequency of 630 kilocycles at Chatham , Ontario.

It may be expected that from time to time the competent authori-

ties of the Government of the United States will receive applications

for permission to establish new broadcasting stations on frequency channels shared between Canada and the United States and for alter-

ation in the assignment of such channels. In certain cases the grant-

ing of such applications might give rise to interference with Cana-

dian stations operating on the same channel . I have been instructed to enquire whether the Government of the

United States would be agreeable to communicating with the Cana-

dian Government in future before issuing licenses for new stations

or altering the assignment of frequencies of existing stations on

channels now shared between the United States and Canada, in cases

where interference might be caused to the free and unrestricted use

of such channels in Canada . The purpose of such a notification

would be to give an opportunity to the Canadian Government of expressing their views in connection therewith.

MONSIEUR LE CHARGÉ D'AFFAIRES, En conclusion des récents échanges de vue, au cours desquels
l'honorable Ambassade et mon Département s'accordèrent pour reconnaître l'opportunité de reculer légèrement l'échéance ( 1er juin de chaque année ) qui avait été fixée par les Accords des 25 octobre 1934 et 15 juin 1936 (réclamations des citoyens américains ; débours effectués par le Gouvernement des Etats-Unis pour la protection des intérêts turcs à l'Etranger) mais qui , du fait de sa coincidence avec le début de l'année budgétaire turque, s'est avérée, dans la pratique, peu propice à des remboursements ayant un caractère d'urgence, j'ai l'honneur de soumettre à l'appréciation de Votre Gouvernement, l'adoption de la date du 20 juin, qui présente l'avantage d'être située en une période de dégagement des Services intéressés , consécutive aux laborieuses occupations que leur impose la clôture annuelle des comptes .
Je Vous saurais donc gré, Monsieur le Chargé d'Affaires, de vouloir bien m'accuser réception de la présente et de me faire part de l'accord de Votre Gouvernement , quant à la consécration de la date que je viens de proposer ci-haut à Son agrément.

I should therefore be grateful to you, Mr. Chargé d'Affaires if you

would please acknowledge receipt of this communication and inform

EXCELLENCY :

Ankara, November 3, 1937.

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of note No. 29 dated October 1 , 1937, from the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs , in

which His Excellency referred to the recent exchanges of views be-

tween the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and the Embassy with regard

to a slight postponement of the due date (June 1st of each year) of

the payments provided for in the Agreements of October 25 , 1934

and of June 15 , 1936 , because that date coincided with the beginning of the Turkish fiscal year and was therefore an inconvenient time on

which to make payments of an important nature. The Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs proposed that June 20th, a more con-

venient and suitable date, be adopted as that on which the above payments would in future be made.

I am pleased to inform Your Excellency that in view of the fore-

going considerations my Government has authorized me to consent to a change of the due date for the payment of the annual installments under the Agreements of October 25 , 1934 and June 15 , 1936 ,

from June 1st to June 20th. Consequently my Government considers that the Agreements of October 25 , 1934 and June 15 , 1936 , have been supplemented to that extent.

I avail myself of the opportunity to present to Your Excellency the assurances of my highest consideration .

IL MINISTRO DEGLI AFFARI ESTERI D'ITALIA ALL'AMBASCIATORE DEGLI STATI UNITI D'AMERICA

SIGNOR AMBASCIATORE,

ROMA, 16 dicembre 1937.

Con nota in data odierna , l'Eccellenza Vostra mi ha comunicato quanto segue:

"Poichè il Trattato di Commercio e Navigazione tra gli Stati Uniti di America e l'Italia firmato a Firenze il 26 febbraio 1871 e scaduto il
15 dicembre 1937 in conseguenza della reciproca denuncia data il 15 dicembre 1936 , assicurava il trattamento della Nazione più favorita in materia doganale, e poichè i negoziati per la definizione di un nuovo Trattato in sostituzione del primo non sono stati portati a termine, sembra opportuno definire il trattamento che sarà accordato da ciascuno dei due Paesi al commercio dell'altro , durante l'intervallo tra la data di scadenza del Trattato 1871 e la data in cui verrà in applicazione il nuovo Trattato .
"Nel corso dei negoziati per il nuovo Trattato i Governi dei due Paesi si sono provvisoriamente accordati sul disposto dell'art. VIII dello stesso che riguarda i dazi doganali, proibizioni e restrizioni all'importazione, licenze di importazione, controllo dei cambi e monopoli concernenti le importazioni , articolo che è allegato alla presenta nota .
"Resta inteso che il Governo italiano , da parte sua, applicherà di fatto , a partire dal 15 dicembre 1937 , le norme dell'art . VIII del trattato proposto e che il Governo degli Stati Uniti d'America, da parte sua, continuerà ad accordare a tutti i prodotti ed articoli agricoli ed industriali italiani, i benefici della tariffa minima americana secondo quanto è fissata negli accordi commerciali con altri Paesi (ad eccezione di Cuba) fino a 30 giorni dopo la denuncia data da una delle parti della sua intenzione di sospendere tale trattamento.
"E ' inteso che le disposizioni del presente Modus Vivendi non si applicano :
1º alle preferenze che l'Italia accorda all'Albania , Austria, Bulgaria, Ungheria e Jugoslavia dal 15 dicembre al 31 dicembre 1937 ;

ITALY- COMMERCIAL RELATIONS- DECEMBER 16, 1937
2º alle preferenze doganali che l'Italia accorderà all'Austria dopo il 31 dicembre 1937 , ai termini dell'Accordo tra l'Italia e l'Austria firmato il 30 novembre 1937 a Roma".
Ho l'onore di portare a conoscenza dell'E. V. che il Governo italiano è d'accordo su quanto precede.
Voglia gradire, Signor Ambasciatore , l'assicurazione della mia più alta considerazione.

Ogni abolizione di una proibizione o restrizione all'importazione o all'esportazione che sia concessa da una delle Alte Parti contraenti a favore di un prodotto originario di o destinato ad un terzo paese, sarà immediatamente e incondizionatamente estesa al similare prodotto originario del, o destinato al territorio dell'altra Alta Parte contraente.

( 1 ) stabilire la totale quantità di ciascun prodotto ammessa all'importazione, alla vendita o all'esportazione durante un determinato periodo ,

(2) comunicare immediatamente all'altra Alta Parte contraente le disposizioni adottate coi completi dettagli relativi alla loro applicazione ; e
(3 ) nel caso di importazioni dovrà concedere all'altra Alta Parte contraente, per tale determinato periodo , una percentuale del totale quantitativo equivalente alla percentuale della totale importazione di detto prodotto che l'altra Alta Parte contraente aveva fornito durante un precedente periodo rappresentativo di tempo, e
(4) nel caso dell'esportazione, accorderà all'altra Alta Parte contraente, per il periodo considerato una percentuale del quantitativo totale equivalente alla percentuale della totale esportazione di tale prodotto che era stata fornita all'altra Alta Parte contraente durante un precedente periodo rappresentativo di tempo , a meno che non venga stabilito di accordo di rinunciare a tale concessione di importazione od esportazione .
Se una delle Alte Parti contraenti stabilisce o mantiene, direttamente od indirettamente, una qualsiasi forma di controllo sui mezzi di pagamento internazionale, essa dovrà, nell'effettuare tale controllo :
a) non imporre alcuna proibizione , restrizione o dilazione nel trasferimento del pagamento per l'importazione di tutti i prodotti ed articoli agricoli e industriali dell'altra Alta Parte contraente, o sul trasferimento dei pagamenti necessari e relativi all'importazione di tali prodotti ;
b) in rapporto ai tassi di cambio ed ai tributi o sovraimposte sulle transazioni valutarie in connessione con pagamenti per, o con pagamenti necessari e relativi all'importazione di tutti i prodotti ed articoli agricoli e industriali dell'altra Alta Parte contraente accordare incondizionatamente un trattamento non meno favorevole di quello accordato all'importazione di qualsiasi prodotto agricolo o industriale di un terzo paese, e

In relazione alle transazioni non commerciali, ciascuna delle Alte Parti contraenti , nell'applicazione di qualsiasi forma di controllo dei cambi esteri non dovrà fare alcuna discriminazione tra i nazionali dell'altra Alta Parte contraente ed i nazionali di un qualsiasi terzo paese.
Nel caso in cui una delle Alte Parti contraenti stabilisca o mantenga un monopolio dell'importazione, produzione o vendita di un determinato prodotto , o conceda dei privilegi esclusivi , formalmente o di fatto , ad una o più agenzie, di importare, produrre o vendere un determinato prodotto , l'Alta Parte contraente che stabilisce o mantiene tale monopolio, o concede tali privilegi monopolistici, dovrà, per gli

Ciascuna delle Alte Parti contraenti dovrà fornire tutte le informazioni relative agli acquisti all'estero di ogni monopolio o agenzia che l'altra Alta Parte contraente potrà, in ogni momento, richiedere .
Le Alte Parti contraenti si consulteranno reciprocamente su ogni questione che l'una o l'altra parte potrà sottoporre relativamente all'applicazione delle disposizioni del presente articolo .

Paragrafo tre.-L'ammontare totale di ogni importazione consentita di cui una quota debba essere assegnata da uno dei due Paesi all'altro , includerà tutte le importazioni della merce sottoposta a regolamentazione, comprese quelle importazioni che possano effettuarsi mediante clearings pubblici o privati, compensazioni, o accordi di pagamento . Nel caso in cui le Autorità di uno dei due Paesi permettessero importazioni addizionali al contingente fissato , stabilendo un contingente supplementare, un'equa parte di tale contingente supplementare dovrà essere assegnata incondizionatamente all'altro Stato.
È inoltre inteso che il periodo base "rappresentativo " dovrà essere uno in cui il commercio dell'altro Paese non veniva diminuito da discriminazioni e non era seriamente influenzato da condizioni di carattere straordinario e transitorio.
Paragrafo quattro, sotto paragrafo (a) .- Imporre la condizione che il pagamento per l'importazione di qualsiasi articolo debba avvenire in compensazione, equivarrebbe a imporre una "restrizione" sul trasferimento del pagamento .
Paragrafo quattro, sotto paragrafo (b ) .- Nel fissare il trattamento della nazione più favorita, in materia di corsi di cambio , si suggerisce che un criterio conveniente potrebbe essere quello di un cambio che sia in parità con quello di alcuni mercati liberi .

The space within the turret or trunk shall be measured as are other between -deck spaces .
8. Spaces considered as "permanently closed in" and spaces permitted to be exempted from measurement shall be determined solely by the provisions contained in these rules, and not by any definitions or provisions contained in the measurement rules or regulations of any country .

covered or closed in, or which may not be readily covered or closed in.

In the application of this rule it will be understood that--

(a) Spaces under decks or coverings having no other connection

with the body of the ship than the stanchions necessary for their sup-

port are not spaces separated off, but are spaces permanently exposed

to the weather and the sea and are not to be included in the gross

tonnage .

(b) A space within a poop, forecastle, bridge house, or other

"permanently covered and closed-in " superstructure or erection may

be considered as not permanently covered or closed-in, and may

consequently be excluded from tonnage, if the space is opposite an

end opening which is not provided with means of closing, and which

opening has a breadth equal to or greater than half the breadth of the

deck at the line of the opening, and if the space opposite the opening

cannot be used to shelter other merchandise than cargo or stores that

do not require protection from the sea. If the opening is fitted with

a coaming, the space within it is to be included in the gross tonnage

if the coaming is more than 2 feet in height . This provision shall be

so applied as to exempt from measurement only the space between the

actual end opening and a line drawn parallel to the line or face of the

opening at a distance from the opening equal to one-half the width of

the deck at the line of the opening ; provided , that any closed-in space

between the open face and the line drawn parallel to it shall be measured . The remainder of the space within a poop, forecastle, bridge

because of any arrangement, except by convergence of fore and aft

bulkheads, of less width than half the breadth of the deck, then only

22. ART. IX. In countries that have not adopted the Moorsom

system of measuring spaces within vessels, the cubical contents of any

of the spaces included in gross tonnage shall be ascertained according

to the Moorsom system as set forth in the following rules : Rule I for

the measurement of empty vessels ; rule II for laden vessels ; rule III for open vessels .

or more decks is taken on the tonnage deck, which is

(a) The upper deck for vessels having one or two decks.

(b) The second deck from below for vessels having more than two decks .

24. Measure the length of ship in a straight line along the upper

side of the tonnage deck from the inside of the inner plank (average thickness) at the side of the stem to the inside of the midship stern timber or plank there, as the case may be (average thickness ) , deducting from this length what is due to the rake of the bow in the thickness of the deck and what is due to the rake of the stern timber

in the thickness of the deck, and also what is due to the rake of the

stern timber in one-third of the round of the beam; divide the length so taken into the number of equal parts required by the following table, according to the class in such table to which the ship belongs:
Class 1 : Ships of which the tonnage deck is, according to the above

measurement, 50 feet long or under, into four equal parts.

Class 2 : Ships of which the tonnage deck is, according to the above

measurement, above 50 feet long and not exceeding 120 feet, into six

equal parts.

Class 3 : Ships of which the tonnage deck is, according to the above

measurement , above 120 feet long and not exceeding 180 feet , into

eight equal parts.

Class 4 : Ships of which the tonnage deck is, according to the above

measurement, above 180 feet long and not exceeding 225 feet, into 10 equal parts.

Class 5 : Ships of which the tonnage deck is , according to the above

measurement, above 225 feet long, into 12 equal parts. (Note : A

greater number of divisions is permissible provided there be an even

number of divisions . )

25. In the case of a break or breaks in a double-bottom, the length

of the vessel is to be taken in parts according to the number of breaks,

PROCLAMATIONS , 1937

of the required depths and breadths being properly taken, find the transverse area of the ship at each point of division of the length or each point of division of the parts of the length, as the case may

require as follows: Measure the depth at each point of division , from a point at a distance of one-third of the round of the beam below the tonnage deck, or, in the case of a break, below a line stretched in

continuation thereof, to the upper side of the floor timber (upper side of the inner plating of the double bottom) at the inside of the

limber strake, after deducting the average thickness of the ceiling
which is between the bilge planks and the limber strake. Vessel constructed
27. In the case of a vessel constructed with longitudinal framing, with longitudinal the depths are to be taken to the upper edge or inner surface of the framing, etc. longitudinal frames, where no double bottoms exist. In the case of a

ship constructed with a double bottom, the depth shall be taken to the upper side of the inner plating of the double bottom, and that upper side shall, for the purposes of measurement, be deemed to

represent the floor timber of the vessel. This rule for measuring the

depth of the hold applies to double-bottom ships having top of double bottom not horizontal. Subject to the provisions of article IV, Ante, p. 377.

section 4 of these rules regarding the exemption of double- bottom spaces, if any tank or compartment between the inner and outer

plating of the double bottom is used or fitted for the carrying of cargo ,

the tonnage of the whole of such tank or compartment shall be

determined and included in the gross tonnage of the vessel .

the inside horizontal breadth at each of the four points of division, and

also at the upper point of the depth, extending each measurement to the average thickness in that part of the ceiling which is between the

points of measurement. Number these breadths from above (i. e. , numbering the upper breadth 1 , and so on down to the fifth breadth) ;

multiply the second and fourth by 4, and the third by 2 ; add these products together, and to the sum add the first breadth and the fifth.

Multiply the quantity thus obtained by one-third of the common interval between the breadths, and the product shall be deemed the transverse area of the upper part of the section ; then find the area

between the fifth and lower point of the depth by dividing the depth between such points into four equal parts, and measure the horizontal

breadths at the three points of division and also at the upper and lower

points, and proceed as before, and the sum of two parts shall be

deemed to be the transverse area ; but if the midship depth exceed 16 feet, divide each depth into seven equal parts instead of five, and measure, as before directed, the horizontal breadths at the six points of

division , and also at the upper point of the depth ; number them from above, as before ; multiply the second , fourth , and sixth by 4 , and the third and fifth by 2 ; add these products together, and to the sum add

the first breadth and the seventh . Multiply the quantity thus obtained by one-third of the common interval between the breadths ,

and the product shall be deemed to be the transverse area of the upper

part of the section ; then find the lower part of the area as before

directed, and add the two parts together, and the sum shall be deemed to be the transverse area.

30. In the case of ships built on the Isherwood system the depths are to be taken to the upper edge of the longitudinal frames , where no double bottom exists. In vessels built of concrete the depths and breadths shall be taken to the inner edge of the main frames . It is to be noted that section 2 , paragraph 29, provides that in vessels without double bottoms no subdivision of the lower part of the

transverse area is to be made . On ships built with transverse frames without double bottoms the depths are to be taken to the top of the transverse frames, and no subdivision of the lower section is necessary .

The tonnage of this volume is obtained by dividing it by 100 , if the measurements are taken in English feet, and by 2.83 if the measurements are taken in meters. The multiplier 0.353 may be used instead of the divisor

32. SEC. 4. If the ship has a third deck the tonnage of the space between it and the tonnage deck shall be ascertained as follows: Measure in feet the inside length of the space at the middle of its height from the plank at the side of the stem to the lining on the timbers at the stern , and divide the length into the same number of equal parts into which the length of the tonnage deck is divided , as above directed ; measure (also at the middle of its height) the inside breadth of the space at each of the points of division , also the breadth at the

stem and the breadth at the stern ; number them successively 1 , 2 , 3 , etc., commencing at the stem ; multiply the second and all the other even-numbered breadths by 4, and the third and all the other oddnumbered breadths (except the first and last) by 2 ; to the sum of these products add the first and last breadths ; multiply the whole sum by one-third of the common interval between the breadths, and the

result will give in superficial feet the mean horizontal area of the space ; measure the mean height of the space, and multiply by it the mean horizontal area, and the product will be the cubical contents of

the space ; divide this product by 100 (or by 2.83 if the measurements are taken in meters) and the quotient shall be deemed to be the tonnage of the space , and shall be added to the tonnage of the ship ascertained as aforesaid ; and if the ship has more than three decks , the tonnage of each space between decks above the tonnage deck shall be severally ascertained in the manner above described , and shall be added to the tonnage of the ship ascertained as aforesaid .

fixed , the length and breadth shall be reckoned from the main frames of the ship, not from the web or belt frames . The same principle is to hold in the case of deck erections ; that is, the breadth is to be reckoned from the main framing or stiffeners of the same, when ceiling is not fitted. When the main framing of the ship is curved or carried upward

and inboard so as to permit the building of top-side tanks or compartments outboard of the main framing, the breadth of the ship shall be reckoned from the outboard framing of such outboard tanks , thus including these tanks in the measurement .

outside of the outer plank at the stem to the aft side of the sternpost,

deducting therefrom the distance between the aft side of the sternpost and the rabbet of the sternpost at the point where the counterplank

crosses it . Measure also the greatest breadth of the ship to the outside of the outer planking or wales at the middle perpendicular . Then , having first marked on the outside of the ship on both sides thereof the

height of the uppermost full-length deck at the ship's sides, girt the ship at the middle perpendicular in a direction perpendicular to the

keel from the height so marked on the outside of the ship, on the one side, to the height so marked on the other side, by passing a chain under the keel ; to half the girth thus taken add half the main breadth ; square the sum, multiply the result by the length of the ship taken as

aforesaid, then multiply this product by the factor 0.17 in the case of

ships built of wood, and by the factor 0.18 in the case of ships built of

iron or steel. The product will give approximately the cubical contents of the ship, and the tonnage can be ascertained by dividing by 100
or by 2.83 , according as the measurements are taken in English feet or in meters .

dimensions suitable for the vessel in question. When a portion of the space within the boundary of the engine or boiler rooms is occupied by a tank or tanks for the storage of fuel oil, lubricating oil , or fresh water, the space considered to be within the engine room shall be reduced

by the space taken up by the tank or tanks for fuel oil , lubricating oil, or fresh water. Note that fuel-oil settling tanks are not to be included in the propelling-power space , no matter where situated . Storerooms, dynamos, ice machine, etc. , situated in the confines of the engine

spaces occupied by the engine room shall be ascertained in the following manner: Measure engine room.
the mean depth of the space occupied by the engines and boilers from

its crown to the ceiling at the limber strake ; measure also three, or, if necessary, more than three, breadths of the space at the middle of its depth, taking one of such measurements at each end and another at

the middle of the length ; take the mean of such breadths ; measure also the mean length of the space between the foremost and aftermost

bulkheads or limits of its length, excluding such parts, if any, as are

not actually occupied by, or required for, the proper working of the engines and boilers . Multiply together these three dimensions of length, breadth, and depth, and the product will be the cubical con-

tents of the space below the crown. Then, by multiplying together the length, breadth , and depth, find the cubical contents of the space or spaces, if any, which are framed in for machinery, for enclosing the funnels, or for the admission of light and air, and which are located

Ante, p. 373.

between the crown of the engine room and the uppermost deck or covering of the first or lowest tier of side-to-side erections, if any, on the upper deck, as defined in article III . Add such contents, as

well as those of the space occupied by the shaft trunk and by any

donkey engine and boiler located within the boundary of the engine room or of the light and air casing above the engine room and used

in connection with the main machinery for propelling the ship , to the cubical contents of the space below the crown of the engine

room ; divide the sum by 100 or by 2.83, according as the measurements are taken in feet or meters , and the result shall be deemed to

be the tonnage of the engine and boiler room and shall be the tonnage

when such bunkers, tanks, and fuel compartments have been certified by official marking to be spaces for the vessel's fuel, the deduction

the following provisions , as the owner of the vessel may elect: Measure the mean length of the engine and boiler room, including the coal bunkers. Ascertain the area of three transverse sections of the ship (as set forth in the rules given in articles VIII or IX for the calculation of the gross tonnage) to the deck which covers the engine . One of these three sections must pass through the middle of the aforesaid length, and the two others through the two extremities . Add to the sum of the two extreme sections four times the middle one, and mul-

Ante, p. 378.

tiply the sum thus obtained by the third of the distance between the sections. This product , divided by 100 if the measurements are taken in English feet , or by 2.83 if they are taken in meters , gives the tonnage of the space measured . If the engines , boilers, and bunkers are in separate compartments, measure each compartment, as above set forth, and add together the results of the several measurements . The bunkers measured for fuel deduction shall include only those bunkers that are absolutely permanent, from which the coal can be trimmed

directly into the engine room or stoke-hole , and into which access can be obtained only through the ordinary coal chutes on deck and from doors opening into the engine room or stokehole. Thwartship bunkers

that can be in any way extended are not to be included in the measure-

ments for deductions. When any portion of the engine or boiler rooms

is occupied by storage tanks for fresh water, the space considered to
