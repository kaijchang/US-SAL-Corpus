Arti cle III. The Delaware tribe of Indians, entertaining the belief that the value of their lands will be enhanced by having a railroad passing through their present reservation, and being of the opinion that the Leavenworth, Pawnee, and Western Railroad Company, incorporated by an act of the legislative assembly of Kansas Territory, will have the advantage of travel and general transportation over every other company proposed to be formed, which will run through their lands, have expressed

a desire that the said Leavenworth, Pawnee, and Western Railroad Com-

pany shall have the preference of purchasing the remainder of then

lands after the tracts in severalty and those for the special objects

herein named shall have been selected and set apart, upon the payment

into the United States treasury, which payment shall be made within six

soon, it is hereby agreed that eighty acres each be set apart for them, to be allotted to them as they return, and certificates to be then issued to them, in the same manner as to those now within the reservation, and in every respect to be governed by the same rules and regulations as prescribed for the government of the lands reserved by the preceding articles, that until they return the allotments set apart for belong to the nation in common.
Art ic le V. There shall be reserved three hundred and twenty acres of ground where the mill, and school-house, and Ketchum's store now stand; three hundred and twenty acres where the council-house now is; one hundred and sixty acres where the Baptist mission now is ; one hundred and sixty acres where the agency house now is; forty acres where the Methodist Episcopal Church South now is; forty acres where the Methodist Episcopal Church North now is; which several tracts, with the improvements thereupon, shall be disposed of when the objects for which they have been reserved shall have been accomplished, in such manner and for such purposes as the Secretary of the Interior shall determine to be just and equitable, for the benefit of the Delawares.

It is further stipulated that should the Senate of the United States refuse this article, it shall in no wise affect the validity of the other articles, or prejudice the right of the Delawares to appeal to the Congress of the United States for the indemnities hereby agreed upon.
It is further understood that, at the treaty between the Delawares and the United States, made September twenty-four, eighteen hundred and twenty-nine, the boundary of the reservation then set apart for them included the Half-breed Kansas lands; but it afterwards proved that the United States had previously set apart these lands for the Half-breed Kaws, and by that means they have been kept out of the use and benefit of said lands; it is, therefore, hereby agreed that a fair valuation shall be made by the United States upon such lands, under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, and that the amount of said valuation shall be
paid the Delawares. Art ic le VII. In consideration of the long and faithful services of the
chiefs of the Delaware nation, and of their interpreter, who is also a member of the nation, it is further agreed that the said chiefs and interpreter shall have allotted to each a tract of land, to be selected by themselves, and shall receive a patent in fee-simple therefor from the President of the United States, viz: John Connor, principal chief, six hundred and forty acres ; Sar-cox-ie, chief of the Turtle band, three hundred and twenty acres ; Rock-a-to-wha, chief of the Turkey band, three hundred and twenty acres; Ne-con-he-con, chief of the Wolf band, three hundred and twenty acres ; and Henry Tiblow, interpreter, three hundred and twenty acres ; the lines of each tract to conform to the legal subdivisions of survey. It is further agreed that, from the money as paid the Delaware tribe of Indians, in accordance with article number ten of this treaty, the chiefs of said tribe of Indians shall appropriate one thousand five hundred dollars as the annual salary of the councilmen of the said tribe

The citizens of each of the high contracting parties, within the jurisdiction of the other, shall have power to dispose of their personal property by sale, donation, testament, or otherwise ; and their personal representatives, being citizens of the other contracting party, shall succeed to their personal property, whether by testament or ab intestato. They may take possession thereof, either by themselves, or by others acting for them, at their pleasure, and dispose of the same, paying such duty only as the citizens of the country wherein the said personal property is situated, shall be subject to pay, in like cases. In the absence of a personal representative, the same care shall be taken of the property as by law would be taken of the property of a native in a similar case, whilst the lawful owner may take measures for securing it. If a question should arise among claimants as to the rightful ownership of the property, the same shall be [finally] decided by the judicial tribunals of the country in which it is situated.
When on the decease of any person holding real estate within the territory of one party, such real estate would by the law of the land descend on a citizen of the other were he not disqualified by alienage, the longest term which the laws of the country in which it is situated will permit, shall be accorded to him to dispose of the same; nor shall he be subjected, in doing so, to higher or other dues, than if he were a citizen of the country wherein such real estate is situated.

Podran tomar posesion de ellos, bien sea por si mismos, d por otros que hagan sus veces, segun su voluntad, y disponer de los mismos, pagando solo aquellos derechos que estuvieren sujetos a pagar en iguales casos los ciudadanos del pais en donde estuvieren situados los dichos bienes muebles. A falta de representante personal se cuidara de los bienes del mismo modo que se cuidaria con arreglo a las leyes de los bienes de un natural en caso semejante, mientras el legitimo dueno tdme providencias para asegurarlos. Si se suscitare cuestion entre los reclamantes sobre la legitima propiedad de los bienes, aquella sera definitivamente decidida por los tribunales de justicia del pais donde se hallaren estos situados.
Cuando al morir alguna persona que tenga bienes raices, dentro del territorio de una parte, ellos pasarian segun el derecho de la tierra, a un ciudadano de la otra, si no lo inhabilitara su calidad de extrangero, se le concedera el mayor plazo que permitan las leyes del pais donde estuvieren situados, para disponer de ellos, y no sera sometido, cuando lo haga, a otros ni mas altos derechos, que los que deberia pagar, si fuera ciudadano del pais en que
tales bienes raices esten situados.

in the jurisdiction of the other, their respective citizens shall receive as well for themselves as for their vessels and effects the same assistance which would be due to the inhabitants of the country where the accident happened, and they shall be liable to pay the same charges and dues of salvage as the said inhabitants would be liable to pay in a like case.
If the repairs which a stranded vessel may require shall render it necessary that the whole or any part of her cargo should be unloaded, no duties of custom, charges, or fees on such cargo as may be carried away shall be paid, except such as are payable in like case by national vessels.

ARTICULO XII.

Rights of neutrals.
Blockade. Notice.
Right to leave.

It shall be lawful for the citizens of either country to sail with their ships and merchandise, (contraband goods always excepted,) from any port whatever, to any port of the enemy of the other, and to sail and trade with their ships and merchandise, with perfect security and liberty, from the countries, ports, and places of those who are enemies of either party, without any opposition or disturbance whatsoever, and to pass not only directly from the places and ports of the enemy aforementioned, to neutral ports and places, but also from one place belonging to an enemy to another place belonging to an enemy, whether they be or be not under the jurisdiction of the same Power, unless such ports or places be effectively blockaded, besieged, or invested.
And whereas it frequently happens that vessels sail for a port or place belonging to an enemy without knowing that the same is either besieged, blockaded, or invested, it is agreed that every vessel so circumstanced may be turned away from such port or place, but she shall not be detained, nor any part of her cargo, (if not contraband,) be confiscated, unless, after notice of such blockade or investment, she shall again attempt to enter; but she shall be permitted to go to any othei' port or place she shall think proper ; provided the same be not blockaded, besieged, or invested. Nor shall any vessel of either of the parties that may have entered into such port or place before the same was actually besieged, blockaded, or invested by the other, be restrained from quitting such place with her cargo, nor, if found therein after the reduction and surrender of such place, shall such vessel or her cargo be liable to confiscation, but they shall be restored to the owners thereof.

Sera Ifctio a los ciudadanos de cualquiera de los dos paises navegar con sus buques y mercancfas (esceptuando siempre los generos de contrabando) de un puerto cualquiera, los del enemigo de la otra, y navegar y traficar con sus buques y mercancfas, con perfecta seguridad y libertad, de los paises, puertos y lugares de los que sean enemigos de una de las partes, sin oposicion ni molestia, y pasar, no solo directamente de los lugares y puertos mencionados del enemigo, a puertos y lugares neutrales, sino tambien de un lugar perteneciente a un enemigo, a otro lugar enemigo, ya sea que esten 6 no bajo la jurisdiccion de la misma potencia, a menos que tales puertos 6 lugares esten efectivamente bloqueados, sitiados, 6 embestidos.
Y por cuanto frecuentemente sucede que navegan buques para un puerto 6 lugar perteneciente a un enemigo sin saber que aquel este sitiado, bloqueado 6 embestido, se conviene en que pueda hacerse volver de tai puerto 6 lugar a todo buque que se halle en estas circunstancias; pero no sera detenida, ni confiscada parte alguna de su cargamento, (no siendo contrabando.) d menos que despues de la intimacion de semejante bloqueo 6 ataque, intentare otra vez entrar; mas le sera permitido ir a cualquier otro puerto 6 lugar que juzgue conveniente, con tai que este no se halle bloqueado, sitiado 6 embestido. Ni se impedira a ningun buque de cualquiera de las partes que haya entrado en tai puerto 6 lugar, antes de estar efectivamente sitiado, bloqueado, 6 embestido por la otra, salir de el con su cargamento, ni, si fuere hallado alii despues de la reduction y entrega del lugar, estara sujeto a confiscation el buque, ni su cargamento, sino que seran restituidos a sus duenos.

It is also agreed, in like manner, that the. same liberty be extended to persons who are on board a free ship, with this effect, that although they be enemies to either party, they are not to be taken out of that free ship unless they are soldiers, and in actual service of the enemy.

Se estipula aqui, que los buques libres daran libertad a los generos, y que se ha de considerar libre y exento, todo lo que se hallare a bordo de los buques pertenecientes a los ciudadanos de cualquiera de las partes contratantes ; aunque toda la carga d parte de ella pertenezca a enemigos de una u otra, esceptuandose siempre los generos de contrabando de guerra. Se conviene tambien del mismo modo, en que se estenderd la misma libertad a las personas que se encuentren abordo de buques libres, con el efecto de que, aunque ellas sean enemigos de cualquiera de las partes, no deban ser estraidos de los buques libres, a no ser militares y estar en actual servicio del enemigo.
