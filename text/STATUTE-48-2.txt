INVESTIGATING SALE, ETC. , OF DAIRY PRODUCTS

etcI.n,voefstdiagiartyinpgrosduacltes,. Whereas an audit made by the Agricultural Adjustment Adminis-

Preamble.

tration has revealed that distributors in four of the largest

milksheds in the United States, for the five years ended Decem-

ber 31 , 1933 , made a net profit of 25.71 per centum on their net

plant investment ; and

Whereas this audit shows the net profits of distributors in each of

the milksheds for the five-year period to be: Philadelphia (dis-

tributors handling 85 per centum of volume) , 30.76 per centum;

Boston (distributors handling 75 per centum of volume) , 22.45

per centum ; Saint Louis (distributors handling 67 per centum of

volume) , 14.64 per centum ; and Chicago (distributors handling

90 per centum of volume) , 25.84 per centum ; and

Whereas during this same five-year period the wholesale price of

milk sold by farmers declined 50 per centum, resulting in severe

hardships and suffering to milk producers throughout the United

States and strikes and violence in many rural and metropolitan centers ; and

Whereas the aforesaid audit by the Agricultural Adjustment Admin-
istration has revealed net profits of milk distributors which tends to establish that similar conditions exist in other milk-

sheds throughout the United States ; and Whereas an investigation in the District of Columbia pursuant to
S.Res . 76, Seventy-third Congress, first session, revealed testimony which abundantly sustains the contention that over a period of years large milk distributors have attempted to create a monopoly in the District of Columbia, and largely as a result of these efforts farmers producing milk for the District of Columbia milkshed have received low returns for their product and have been placed at a serious disadvantage ; and

CONCURRENT RESOLUTIONS OF CONGRESS .

Whereas the testimony adduced at hearings in the aforesaid investigation in the District of Columbia tends to prove that similar monopolistic efforts likewise exist in other milksheds in the United States ; and
Whereas there is reason to believe that there exists a close tie between
certain leaders of milk producers' cooperatives and milk distributors, which tie is unbeknown to milk producers and detrimental to their interests ; and Whereas the continuation of the practices now engaged in by milk distributors and certain leaders of milk cooperatives seriously endangers the efforts of the Agricultural Adjustment Administration and of the several States to alleviate and remedy the distress now widespread among dairy farmers in the United States, which distress if permitted to continue will result in the destruction of the already sorely pressed agricultural industry: Therefore be it

or addressee, unless the initials are the adopted trade name of the senders or addressees which is generally understood . Addresses in pencil are also not allowed , except those written with copying ink on a surface previously dampened.
A slip bearing the name and address of the sender and addressee must be enclosed in the parcel when the address is written on a label or tag which is not gummed to the parcel . It is advisable that such slips be enclosed in all parcels.
2. Every parcel must be packed in a manner adequate for the length of the journey and the character of the contents, and in such a way as to prevent the contents from damaging other parcels or objects or injuring the postal agents. The packing must protect the contents sufficiently that, in case of rifling, the traces thereof may be easily discovered .
No packing is required for ordinary parcels consisting of a single article, such as pieces of wood, metal , etc. , which are not usually packed by the trade.
Any liquid or any substance which easily liquefies must be packed in a double receptacle. Between the first receptacle (bottle, flask, pot, box, etc. ) and the second (box of metal, of strong wood, of strong corrugated cardboard or of strong fibreboard or receptacle of equal strength ) shall be left a space which shall be filled with sawdust, bran or some other absorbent material, in sufficient quantity to absorb all the liquid contents in the case of breakage.
Powders and dyes in powder form must be packed in lead-sealed metal containers which must be enclosed in substantial outer covers ,
so as to obviate all damage to the accompanying mail matter. 3. Insured parcels must be sealed by means of wax, by lead or
other seals. Ordinary parcels may be sealed at the option of the sender, or careful tying is sufficient as a mode of closing. Either Administration may require a special design or mark of the sender in the sealing of insured parcels mailed in its service, as a means of protection.
The customs of the country of destination, for the purpose of customs examination , shall have the right to break the seals. After customs examination is concluded , the parcels shall be officially resealed .
4. On the address side, each insured parcel must bear a label with the words " Insured " or " Valeur déclarée ", or be stamped or marked with the same words in close proximity to the number given the parcel, and it must also bear an indication of the amount of the
insured value, mentioned fully and legibly in the currency of the country of origin and in Roman letters. This amount must be converted into gold francs by the sender or by the office of origin and the result of conversion is added below the original description. The amount of the insured value must also be indicated on the customs declaration .
5. The seals, as well as any kind of labels or stamps, affixed to insured parcels, must be so placed as not to hide injuries to the package. Moreover, the labels or stamps must not be folded over two sides of the package so as to cover the edge.

Ante, p. 1515.

THE TREATY

The Secretary of State (Stimson) to the Polish Ambassador (Filipowicz)

DEPARTMENT OF STATE,

EXCELLENCY:

Washington, June 15, 1931 .

I have the honor to communicate to Your Excellency my under-

standing of the agreement reached regarding the requirements for furnishing proof of the origin of imported merchandise entitled to the

benefits of the treaty of friendship , commerce and consular rights signed this day on behalf of the United States of America and Poland.

In the event that proof of the origin of imported goods is required

by either Party pursuant to the provisions of the tenth paragraph of

Article VI of the treaty , it is agreed that (1 ) A declaration by the shipper in the country of origin legalized

by a consular representative of the country of final destination resident in the country of origin shall be accepted as satisfactory proof

of the origin of the goods . As far as certificates of origin for importation into the Polish customs territory are concerned, the above-

mentioned shipper's declaration before legalization by a consular representative of Poland, has to be certified by a competent Chamber

of Commerce or similar organization, subject to the exceptions provided for in subparagraph (a) of paragraph (3) hereof.

(2) For indirect shipments an acceptable alternative to the certificate of origin obtained in the country of origin as provided in paragraph ( 1 ) shall be proof of origin obtainable in the intermediate

country from which the goods are last shipped to the country of final destination . Such proof shall consist of a declaration by the consignor of the goods in the intermediate country before a consular officer of the country of origin resident in the intermediate country, certified by the latter and approved by a consular representative of the country of final destination resident in the intermediate country , it being understood that the consular representatives of the country of origin shall not certify the shipper's declaration for this purpose unless they are satisfied upon examination of documentary or other evidence that the statements made therein are true.
(3) The attached form of certificate of origin for use in connection

with direct shipments from the United States to Poland and the attached form for use in connection with indirect shipments from the

United States to Poland through an intermediate country or countries ,

1536

FRIENDSHIP, ETC. , TREATY- POLAND. JUNE 15, 1931 .
respectively, conform to the provisions above set forth, it being understood and agreed, however, that
(a ) If the circumstances of any particular case render it impracticable for the shipper of the goods to obtain certification on a certificate of origin by a Chamber of Commerce or similar organization, the certificate of origin may be submitted for authentication directly to a Polish consular officer, and the fact that certification by a Chamber of Commerce or similar organization has not been obtained shall not be considered by such consular officer as of itself sufficient ground for refusing to authenticate the document .
(b) If at the time the certificate of origin is made out circumstances render it difficult or inconvenient for shippers to specify on such certificate the name of the vessel on which the goods are to be shipped, the necessities and convenience of shippers shall be taken into account either by waiving this requirement or by making such other provision as the circumstances of the case require .
(c) In exceptional cases in which doubt exists regarding the exact proportion of the value of any given article represented by the costs of the labor and raw material of the United States, or in which such proportion is less than fifty per centum, but the article, in view of the nature and extent of the processes to which it has been subjected , is distinctly an American product, no certification regarding such proportion on a certificate of origin shall be required.
Any article in which the raw material or the labor of the United States represents less than fifty per centum of the total value shall, nevertheless, be deemed to be a product of the United States if a like article from any third country representing less than fifty per centum in value the labor and raw material of such third country is deemed to be a product of that country .
(4) In the event that modification of the requirements outlined in the preceding paragraphs is at any time considered desirable from the viewpoint of either Party, it is agreed that its proposals to this end shall be given sympathetic consideration by the other Party.
I shall be glad to have your confirmation of the accord thus reached. Accept, Excellency, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration.

(1) The Government of the United States of America reserves the right to impose, for purpose of internal control and control of import into and export from territory under its jurisdiction , of opium, coca leaves, all of their derivatives and similar substances produced by synthetic process , measures stricter than the provisions of the Convention.
(2) The Government of the United States of America reserves the right to impose, for purposes of controlling transit through its territories of raw opium, coca leaves, all of their derivatives and similar substances produced by synthetic process, measures by which the production of an import permit issued by the country of destination may be made a condition precedent to the granting of permission for transit through its territory.
(3) The Government of the United States of America finds it impracticable to undertake to send statistics of import and export to the Permanent Central Opium Board short of sixty days after the close of the three-months' period to which such statistics refer.
(4) The Government of the United States of America finds it impracticable to undertake to state separately amounts of drugs purchased or imported for Government purposes.
(5) Plenipotentiaries of the United States of America formally declare that the signing of the Convention for Limiting the Manufacture and Regulating the Distribution of Narcotic Drugs by them on the part of the United States of America on this date is not to be construed to mean that the Government of the
United States of America recognises a regime or entity which signs or accedes to the Convention as the Government of a country when that regime or entity is not recognised by the Government of the United States of America as the Government of that country.
(6) The plenipotentiaries of the United States of America further declare that the participation of the United States of America in the Convention for limiting the manufacture of and regulating the distribution of narcotic drugs, signed on this date, does not involve any contractual obligation on the part of the United States of America to a country represented by a regime or entity which the Government of the United States of America does not recognise as the Government

(2) Le Gouvernement des Etats-Unis d'Amérique se réserve le droit d'appliquer, en vue de l'exercice d'un contrôle sur le transit à travers ses territoires de l'opium brut, des feuilles de coca, de tous leurs dérivés et des produits synthétiques analogues, des mesures en vertu desquelles l'octroi d'une autorisation de transit à travers son territoire pourra être subordonné à la production d'un permis d'importation délivré par le pays de destination .
(3) Le Gouvernement des Etats-Unis d'Amérique ne voit pas la possibilité de s'engage à envoyer au Comité central permanent de l'opium des statistiques des importations et des exportations avant un délai de soixante jours à dater de la fin de la période de trois mois à laquelle se rapportent ces statistiques.
(4) Le Gouvernement des Etats-Unis d'Amérique ne voit pas la possibilité de s'engager à indiquer séparément les quantités de stupéfiants achetées ou importées pour les besoins de l'Etat.
(5) Les plénipotentiaires des Etats-Unis d'Amérique declarent formellement que le fait qu'ils ont signé ce jour, pour le compte des Etats-Unis d'Amérique, la Convention pour la limitation de la fabrication et la réglementation de la distribution des stupéfiants, ne doit pas être interprété comme signifiant que le Gouvernement des Etats-Unis d'Amérique reconnaît un régime ou une entité qui signe la Convention ou y accède comme constituant le gouvernement d'un pays, lorsque ce régime ou cette entité n'est pas reconnue par le Gouvernement des Etats-Unis d'Amérique comme constituant le gouvernement de ce pays.
(6) Les plénipotentiaires des Etats-Unis d'Amérique déclarent, en outre, que la participation des Etats-Unis d'Amérique à la Convention pour la limitation de la fabrication et la réglementation de la distribution des stupéfiants, signée ce jour, n'implique aucune obligation contractuelle de la part des États-Unis d'Amérique à l'égard d'un pays représenté par un régime ou une entité que le Gouvernement des Etats-Unis d'Amérique ne reconnaît pas comme constituant le gouvernement de ce pays, tant que ce pays n'a pas un gouvernement reconnu par le Gouvernement des Etats-Unis d'Amérique.

Either of the two coun-
tries signing the present Agreement which wrongly forwards an insured parcel to a third country is responsible to the sender to the same extent as the country of origin, that is, within the limits of the present Agreement.

The Commission met in the conference room at the Department of Foreign Relations, Mexico City, at ten o'clock a.m. July 31 , 1930, in accordance with Minute No. 128, to complete its action in reporting and recommending a plan for Rio Grande rectification .
(1 ) Each section of the International Boundary Commission has been requested by the Foreign Relations Department of its Government to study and develop an international plan for the removal of the flood menace of the Rio Grande from the El Paso-Juarez Valley. Studies and investigations have now reached the point where it is possible to report to the two Governments a definite plan with estimates of cost ; and the following is the report of the International Boundary Commissioners, together with a joint report prepared by the consulting engineers and technical advisers. Minute No. 111 of the Joint Commission , dated December 21 , 1928 , outlined in a general way the necessities for international action and gave a general description of the areas involved, a preliminary summary of the proposed plan and recommended proceeding with the development of the final details of the plans and estimates . During the past few months a most important step taken by the Commission consisted in rendering decisions determining the national jurisdiction and dominion of a number of

La Comisión se reunió en la Sala de Conferencias de la Secretaría de Relaciones Exteriores en la Ciudad de México, a las 10 horas del día 31 de julio de 1930, de acuerdo con lo convenido en el
Acta No. 128, para formalizar por medio de esta Acta su informe y recomendaciones a los dos Gobier-
nos sobre el proyecto de Rectificación del Río Bravo.
(1 ) Cada una de las Secciones de la Comisión Internacional de Límites ha recibido instrucciones de la Secretaría de Relaciones Exteriores de su respectivo Gobierno para estudiar y preparar un proyecto de carácter internacional a fin de conjurar el peligro de inundación por aguas del Río Bravo, que se cierne sobre el Valle de Juárez-El Paso . Los estudios y las investigaciones han llegado a un punto tal que permiten presentar a los dos Gobiernos un proyecto definido y un presupuesto de costos, y a continuación aparece el Informe de los Comisionados de la Comisión Internacional de Límites, acompañado de un informe común preparado por los Ingenieros Consultores y los Asesores Técnicos. En el Acta No. 111 de la Comisión Unida, de fecha 21 de Diciembre de 1928 se delineó , en términos generales, la necesidad de tomar medidas de carácter internacional y se hizo una descripción general de los terrenos afectados y un resumen preliminar del proyecto y se recomendó que se elaborara éste hasta sus detalles finales y costos. Durante los últimos meses la Comisión ha dado un

as an engineering and economic project. In general the plan consists of straightening the present river channel, effecting decrease in length from one hundred fiftyfive (155) miles to eighty-eight (88) miles, and confining this channel between two parallel levees. In addition to this channel the plan includes the construction of a flood retention dam at

While the use of areas may be entirely proper in a distribution of costs for irrigation development, this unit of proration for an international flood control plan is unsuitable and produces serious irregularities.

Si bien es cierto que en la distribución del costo de un sistema de irrigación sería adecuado tomar como base las extensiones de terreno, si se adoptara esta misma base para el reparto del costo del proyecto internacional de obras de defensa se llegaría a conclusiones injustificadas e inaceptables .

ceive on the sole acreage basis. On the American side of the valley there are about fifty-three thousand (53,000 ) acres of land under the Rio Grande Federal Irrigation Project with water rights assured; the greater part of which is in full cultivation, and about seventeen thousand (17,000 ) acres in the lower portion of the valley below the project limits which are irrigated with project surplus water. The total irrigated area is seventy thousand (70,000) acres . This area is served with irrigation and drainage works, and firstclass roads. Finance companies facilitate the financing of the production and distribution of agricultural products .

En el lado americano del Valle hay 21.200 hectáras (53.000 acres) con derechos de agua asegurados dentro del Sistema Federal de Irrigación " Río Grande " , estando la mayor parte de esta extensión bajo cultivo ; hay también 6.800 hectáras (17.000 acres ) en la región inferior del Valle, y fuera de los límites del Sistema, que se riegan con las aguas sobrantes del mismo . El área total regada es de 28.000 hectáras (70.000 acres), que tienen obras de riego y de drenaje y caminos de primera clase . Existen además Compa-

major road improvements exist, and the finance companies organized to serve Mexican farmers are very limited in number and resources. The industrial plants
and means for handling agricultural products are in very small proportion when compared with those in the valley in the United States.
(10 ) The estimated value of
agricultural investments in the American part of the valley, according to figures assembled by the Bureau of Reclamation, including purchase of land and its preparation, farm improvements, equipment and live stock, is seventeen million dollars ($17.000,000) or thirty-four million gold pesos . The value of agricultural improvements on the Mexican side as estimated by Engineer Salvador Arroyo, Chief of the Flood Protection Work, is five million four hundred thousand ($5,400,000) gold pesos . Comparing these agricultural values in one part of the valley with those in the other it is seen that the Mexican side represents thirteen per cent of the total and the American eighty-seven per cent. Valley lands on either side of the river without water rights and assured irrigation service have very nominal value as compared with the lands obtaining water service from project sources ; a comparison of such areas on this basis results in twenty-seven per cent for Mexico and seventythree per cent for the United States.
(11 ) As the cities and suburbs of El Paso and Juarez not only are included in the flood protection plan, but either directly or indirectly would receive a large part of the benefits of the rectification of the channel, the Commission has considered the proration of values which each city bears to the other and giving proper weights to various percentages, believes the justifiable proration to be twelve (12) per cent

servir a los Minute No. 129 ofInorganizadas para servir a los ternational Boundary agricultores mexicanos son en Commission-Contd. número limitado y de escasos recursos. Las plantas industriales y los medios para la distribución de los productos agrícolas son inferiores a los que hay del lado de los Estados Unidos en este Valle.
(10 ) De acuerdo con los datos recopilados por el " Bureau of Reclamation", se estima en $ 17, 000.000.00 de dólares ($34.000.000.00 de pesos oro nacional) el valor de las inversiones agrícolas en la parte americana del Valle, incluyendo precio de la tierra, su preparación, las mejoras materiales y edificios de los ranchos , los implementos y semovientes. El valor de las inversiones agrícolas en el lado mexicano es de $5.400.000 oro nacional según el avalúo hecho por el Ingeniero Salvador Arroyo, Jefe de la Comisión de Obras de Defensa contra Inundaciones. Si se comparan las inversiones agrícolas en un lado del Valle con las del otro , puede verse que el lado mexicano representa el 13 % del total, y el lado americano el 87 %. Los
terrenos en cada lado del Río que no tienen derechos de agua asegurados ni servicio de riego permanente, tienen un valor insignificante comparados con los terrenos que se surten de agua del Sistema de Riego, y al comparar las extensiones correspondientes a terrenos de esta categoría, resulta el 27 % de ellos en México y el 73 % en los Estados Unidos.
(11 ) Puesto que las ciudades y los suburbios de Juárez y El Paso, además de quedar cubiertos por el Proyecto de Obras de Defensa contra las Inundaciones, reciben directa o indirectamente una gran parte de los beneficios de la rectificación del cauce, la Comisión ha tomado en cuenta los valores relativos de una y otra ciudad, y después de asignar a los varios porcentajes los pesos debidos , considera que el reparto equita-

teMrniantuitoneaNlo.Bo12u9nodfaIrny- for Mexico and eighty-eight (88) Commission-Contd. per cent for the United States.
(12 ) With reference to the estimates (exhibit number five of the engineers' report) the grand total of six million one hundred six thousand five hundred dollars ($6.106,500 ) includes certain items in which the Commissioners concur as being non-proratable and properly and practically chargeable to each Government separately . These are: rights-ofway four hundred twelve thousand five hundred dollars ($412 ,500) , for purchase of private channel rights above Cordova seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000), segregated tracts two hundred sixty-six thousand dollars ($ 266,000) , changes in irrigation works two hundred twentyfive thousand dollars ($ 225,000) . The total of these items, with twenty per cent overhead and contingencies is one million one hundred seventy-four thousand two hundred dollars ($ 1.174,200 ) . This amount subtracted from the grand total leaves a proratable total of four million nine hundred thirty-two thousand three hundred dollars ($ 4,932.300 ) . Using twelve per cent ( 12 % ) and eighty eight per cent (88 %) as the basis of proration Mexico's share of the cost of the project would be five hundred ninety-one thousand eight hundred seventy-six doilars ($591,876 ) and that of the United States four million three hundred forty thousand four hundred twenty-four dollars ($4.340,424) .
(13 ) On the basis that this report and the engineers ' statement have been prepared and submitted with the view of generally straightening the present river location between the Inter-
national Dam above El PasoJuarez and the Box Canyon below Fort Quitman , the question of using the present river at Fabens or following the boundary route on the south of the San Elizario area is left for later
determination. From the data

tivo de los costos puede hacerse a razón de 12 % para México y 88% para los Estados Unidos.
(12) En cuanto al presupuesto contenido en el anexo No. 5 del informe de los Ingenieros, los Comisionados juzgan que del total de $ 6.106,500.00 dólares, algunos gastos no deben repartirse a "pro-rata " , sino cargarse a cada Gobierno separadamente, por razones de conveniencia práctica. Estas partidas son: Derecho de vía $412,500.00 dólares ; compra de propiedades particulares dentro del cauce del Río arriba de Córdova $ 75.000.00 dólares ; terrenos segregados, $266.000.00 dólares y cambios en las obras de riego, $225.000.00 dólares . El total de estas partidas , aumentado en un 20 % por gastos de administración e imprevistos, es de $ 1.174,200.00 dólares , que, deducido del gran total, arroja un total de $4.932,300.00 dólares que repartido en la proporción de 12% y de 88 %, resulta que correspondería a México como participación en este proyecto , la cantidad de $ 591.876.00 dólares y a los Estados Unidos $4.340,424.00 dólares .
(13 ) Partiendo de la base de que el presente informe y el estudio de los Ingenieros se han preparado y se presentan con la idea de rectificar en general el cauce actual del Río entre la Presa Internacional arriba de Juárez-El Paso y el Cañón de Cajoncitos abajo de Fort Quitman, se ha dejado para decidirse en el futuro la elección entre los dos trazos en la Isla de San Elizario, es decir, si debe seguirse el cauce actual del Río que pasa por Fabens o si debe llevarse por

Since the joint preliminary report, dated December 1928, was submitted to the Commission , location surveys covering the entire lenght¹ of river from the cities of El Paso and Juarez to Quitman Canyon have been completed. These surveys have furnished additional data, and form in a large measure the basis for the report which follows.

This phase of changing channel has been largely prevented thru El Paso-Juarez Valley by the construction of artificial works , such as railroad
and road grades, canal and drain banks , and in late years, levees . Under these conditions the river bed has been continuously elevated . The Elephant Butte Dam was completed in the year 1916 , and as a result of its function of

Esta fase de cambios de cauce, ha sido en gran parte prevenida, a través del Valle de Juárez-El Paso , por la construcción de obras artificiales como terraplenes de ferrocarriles y de caminos, bordos de canales de riego y drenaje y, en los últimos años, diques de protección contra inundaciones . En estas circunstancias el lecho del

providing an irrigation supply during years of low run-off, it stores the floods, which previous to its construction had passed on down the river. The action of these floods was to scour out the
river channel, partly by carrying deposits on thru the valleys and partly by making deposits upon the valley floor whenever bank overflow stage was reached. The absence, since the completion of Elephant Butte Dam, of large scouring floods has changed the characteristics of the river channel thru the El Paso-Juarez Valley. Although large floods have been controlled behind the Elephant Butte Dam, smaller floods from the run-off area lying between Elephant Butte and El Paso-Juarez are of annual occurrence . These usually occur during the rainy season, that is, in August and September, and are generally flashy in character, the peak lasting only a few hours , and would pass harmlessly thru the valley were it not for the elevated bed .

Río ha continuado sobre-elevándose. La Presa del Elefante terminada el año de 1916 , al llenar su objeto, que consiste en asegurar una dotación permanente para el riego de terrenos durante los
años de poca precipitación , almacena las crecientes que, antes de su construcción, pasaban Río abajo . El efecto de estas crecientes era socavar el cauce del Río, arrastrando parte de los azolves y depositando otra parte sobre los terrenos adyacentes al desbordarse la corriente . La carencia de fuertes crecientes erosivas después de la terminación de la Presa del Elefante, marcó el cambio del régimen de la corriente en el Valle de JuárezEl Paso . A pesar de que las grandes avenidas se almacenan en el vaso del Elefante , anualmente ocurren crecientes más pequeñas que provienen de la cuenca tributaria del Río entre el Elefante y Juárez-El Paso . Estas últimas crecientes se presentan durante la estación de lluvias, generalmente en los meses de agosto y septiembre ; son repentinas y de poca duración y pasarían a través del Valle sin causar

daños si no fuese por la posición elevada del cauce del Río con

respecto a los terrenos adyacentes .

About two thousand three hundred (2300 ) square miles (6,000 square kilometers) drain directly into the river, of which some one thousand two hundred (1200 ) square miles (3100 square kilometers) are above and would be controlled by a dam constructed at the Caballo site.
(b) This damsite is located in Sierra County, New Mexico on the Rio Grande about twenty-two (22) miles (35 kilometers) below Elephant Butte Dam. Studies of the Caballo Dam and the result-
ing reservoir have been made by the Bureau of Reclamation, Department of the Interior, United States Government, in conjunction with the proposed water power development at Elephant Butte. These studies were begun in the year 1924 and included the surveying of the site, the testing of the foundation , the design and cost estimates of structures of various heights, and the effect on water supply and flood control . Two reports were written by the United States Bureau of Reclamation engineers, covering this dam and related features, one dated December 15, 1924 , and the other April 1925.

Estos estudios se iniciaron el año de 1924 e incluyeron los trabajos de topografía del vaso, los experimentos del terreno de cimentación , y proyectos y presupuestos para estructuras de diversas alturas, considerando sus efectos sobre el abastecimiento de agua y retención de la misma para fines de protección contra inundaciones. Los Ingenieros de la Oficina del " Reclamation " prepararon dos informes acerca del pro-

Commission- Contd.

(a) An estimate of the probable spill at Elephant Butte Dam has been made from a study of the spills as shown in the report of the Denver office of the Bureau of Reclamation, dated March 10 , 1928 and entitled " Review of Quinton, Code and Hill Reports on Elephant Butte Power Development of July 2, 1927 and September 30 , 1927 ". This review sets up the following assumptions :
1.-Irrigation storage is to be carried to elevation 4401 , leaving six feet (1.83 meters) , or the elevation 4407 , for flood control storage. This six feet (1.83 meters) will store two hundred thirtynine thousand (239,000) acre feet (294.806,000 cubic meters) . Additional flood control storage of about one hundred thousand (100,000) acre feet (123.350,000 cubic meters) is available to elevation 4410, at which height a discharge of about four thousand five hundred (4,500) second feet (128 cubic meters per second) will be passing over the spillway crest.
2.-Irrigation demand is to be limited to seven hundred thousand (700,000) acre feet (863.450.000 cubic meters ) annually when on June 30th of any year the reservoir content is less than one million five hundred thousand (1.500,000) acre feet ( 1.850,250, 000 cubic meters) . Irrigation demand is to be limited to seven
hundred eighty-seven thousand (787,000) acre feet (970.764,000 cubic meters) annually when on June 30th of any year the reservoir content is more than one million five hundred thousand (1.500,000) acre feet (1.850,250,000 cubic meters) .
3.-Reservoir capacity depletion thru silt deposit is at the average rate of twenty thousand (20,000) acre feet (26.670,000 cubic meters) per year.

Este estudio establece los siguientes supuestos:
1.-El almacenamiento para riego debe limitarse hasta la cota 4401 , dejando 1.83 Mts. (6 pies) , o hasta la cota 4407, para al-
macenamiento de protección contra inundaciones . En esta altura de 1.83 Mts. (6 pies) se almacenará un volumen de 294.806,000 metros cúbicos (239,000 acres pies) . Puede obtenerse un almacenamiento adicional para protección contra inundaciones con volumen aproximado de 123.350 ,000 metros cúbicos (100,000 acres pies) hasta la cota 4410, altura a la cual escurrirá sobre la Cresta del Vertedor de Demasías un gasto de 128 metros cúbicos por segundo (4500 pies cúbicos por segundo) .
2.-El volumen necesario para cubrir las necesidades del riego debe limitarse a 863.450,000 metros cúbicos (700,000 acres pies) anualmente, cuando el contenido del receptáculo el 30 de junio de un año cualquiera sea menor de 1.850,250,000 metros cúbicos , (1.500,000 acres pies) . El volumen para riego debe limitarse a 970.-

3.-La diminución de la capaci-
dad del vaso por azolve se estima a razón de 24.670,000 metros cúbicos (20,000 acres pies) al año.

(b) Practically no direct discharge of side drainage occurs below El Paso-Juarez until the Arroyo Alamo in Hudspeth County is reached . Below this point three large arroyos and many small ones empty directly into the river. The total drainage area on the American side between the Arroyo Alamo and Quitman Canyon is six hundred eighty (680) square miles (1760 square kilometers), of which four hundred ninety (490) square miles (1270 square kilometers) have direct discharge into the river and one hundred ninety (190) square miles (490 square kilometers) are indirectly discharged into the river. The drainage area on the Mexican side is considerably less,
although, due to the absence of maps, little detail knowledge is available. However, no arroyos empty directly into the river from the south until considerably below the town of McNary, Texas, and observations of the arroyo channels below this point show that their drainage areas are probably limited and their discharges small.
(c) The three largest arroyos on the American side are: the Alamo, with a drainage area of one hundred forty-five (145) square miles (375 square kilometers) ; the Diablo , with a drainage area of sixty-two (62) square miles (160 square kilometers ) ; and the Guayuco, with a drainage

El área de drenaje en el lado Mexicano es mucho menor, sin que se conozca en detalle por la carencia de planos de esta región . Sin embargo, no hay arroyos que, del Sur, entren directamente al Río, sino hasta muy abajo de la población de McNary, Texas, pudiendo deducirse de la inspección de los cauces de los arroyos abajo de este lugar, que sus áreas de drenaje son probablemente limitadas y sus gastos pequeños .

(a) The distance by the river between Elephant Butte and El Paso-Juarez is about one hundred
fifty (150) miles (241 kilometers) , and the valley axial distance is about one hundred twenty ( 120 ) miles ( 193 kilometers ) . Immediately below the dam the river passes thru fifteen miles (24 kilometers) of canyon where the fall varies from .00037 ( 1.94 feet per mile) to .00080 (4.26 feet per mile) then thru the Palomas Valley for thirteen miles (21 kilometers ) with a fall of .00080 (4.26 feet per mile) , then thru three miles (5 kilometers) of canyon where the Caballo damsite is located , then thru the Rincon Valley, the first seven miles (11 kilometers) of which have an average fall of .00074 (3.93 feet per mile) , and

per mile) . The river then traverses seven miles ( 11 kilometers ) known as the Selden Canyon, where the average fall is .00064 (3.4 feet per mile) , and then reaches the Leasburg Dam which is at the head of the Mesilla Valley. From Leasburg Dam to Mesilla Dam, a distance of twenty four miles (39 kilometers), the river has a fall of .00073 (3.84 feet per mile) . From Mesilla Dam to Canutillo Bridge, a distance of twenty-eight miles (45 kilometers ) the river has a fall of .00070 (3.67 feet per mile) , and from the Canutillo Bridge to the International Dam, some nineteen miles (30 kilometers) the river has a fall of .00048 (2.53 feet per mile) .
(b) As previously stated , the effect of the release of clear water from Elephant Butte Dam has been to degrade the river bed in the upper reaches immediately below the dam, and to build it up thru the El Paso-Juarez Valley. There is necessarily a stretch of river between these two actions which is quiescent, where neither degradation nor building up is going on . Studies of river sections indicate that the river bed thru the lower Mesilla Valley rests in this state.

El Río atraviesa en seguida el cañón Selden de 11 kilómetros de longitud (7 millas) con una pendiente media de 0.00064 (3.40 pies por milla) y llega a la presa de Leasburg, situada en la parte alta del Valle de Mesilla. Desde la Presa de Leasburg hasta la de Mesilla, el Río tiene 39 kilómetros de longitud (24 millas) con una pendiente de 0.00073 (3.84 pies por milla) . Desde la Presa de Mesilla hasta el Puente de Canutillo, la longitud del Río es de 45 kilómetros (28 millas) con una pendiente de 0.00070 (3.67 pies por milla) , y desde el Puente de Canutillo hasta la Presa Internacional, la longitud es de 30 kilómetros (19 millas) y la pendiente de 0.00048 (2.53 pies por milla) .
(b) Como se ha dicho antes, el efecto de la salida de agua clara de la Presa del Elefante ha sido
el de socavar el lecho del Río en la región inmediatamente abajo de la Presa, y azolvarlo en el Valle de Juárez-El Paso . Debe existir forzosamente un tramo del Río en el que estas dos acciones se equilibran, y en el que, por lo tanto, no se verifica ni socavación ni azolve. Estas condiciones existen en la parte baja del Valle de Mesilla, según lo demuestra el estudio de las secciones del Río .

(a) The length of the channel of the river between El Paso-

The fall of the river is about .00034 (1.82 feet per mile ) while the fall of the valley is .00061 (3.20 feet per mile) .

that this fall is in excess of that in the last stretch of the Mesilla
Valley, or between Canutillo Bridge and the International Dam, where a fall of .00048 (2.53 feet per mile) was indicated and that this fall of .00061 (3.2 feet per mile) is somewhat under that of .00070 (3.67 feet per mile ) for the upper part of the Mesilla Valley. If the lower stretch of the river in the Mesilla Valley is in equilibrium , that is, shows neither scour nor fill, with a gradient of .00048 (2.53 feet per mile) the river thru the El Paso-Juarez
Valley must have a greater gradient to reach the same state of equilibrium since the quantities of water normally carried are greatly reduced at the International Dam

Ahora bien, si con una pendiente de 0.00048 (2.53 pies por milla) el Río está en equilibrio en el tramo inferior del Valle de Me-

III.-PROPOSED PLAN

III.-PROYECTO

(a) The treatment to be given the river thru the valley to increase the fall from .00034 ( 1.82 feet per mile) to .00061 (3.2 feet per mile), in order to accelerate the velocity and to let the current of the river carry along the burden of sand and sediment, which has caused the rapid river bottom rising, so marked since the construction of the EElleepphhaanntt Butte Dam, consists of a general straightening following the present channel of the river wherever possible, and cutting across the bends where necessary to decrease length. Along each side of the new channel , and also along each side of the present river where followed, levees will be built of sufficient height and far enough apart to pass the floods . The channel thus created will always
be kept clear of brush and other obstructions which might retard the flow. In the alignment, due consideration has been given to the general principle of the compensation of the artificially segregated areas, in order to equalize

determinado el ascenso rápido del fondo del Río , tan marcado desde la construcción de la Presa del Elefante, se proyecta modificar el Río enderezándolo en lo general , siguiendo el cauce actual en
donde sea posible, y cortando las vueltas cuando sea necesario, a fin de disminuir la longitud . A cada lado del cauce nuevo y a los lados del cauce actual del Río en donde se siga éste, se construirán diques de altura suficiente y a distancia conveniente para permitir el paso de las avenidas . El cauce así formado se conservará siempre libre de yerbas y obstrucciones que pudieran retardar el escurrimiento . Al hacer el trazo se ha atendido como principio fundamental a igualar las áreas que se segreguen artificialmente, a fin de que la extensión total que

be cut from the other. (b ) This treatment brings
about the result that the right-ofway to be acquired by each nation will balance practically in area . In general, the water-way proposed will consist of a normal channel of similar size and capacity to the present river bed, with levees set back with a total distance of about five hundred ninety (590 ) feet (180 meters ) between them. Levees will be wide enough on top to permit travel for inspection and repair. The alignment has been so chosen as to avoid as far as possible all highly improved and cultivated areas, but at many places this was impracticable due to the meanderings of the river channel .
(c) The above plan of shortening the river by cut-offs is feasible in this case because Elephant Butte Dam, in conjunction with the proposed Caballo Dam and reservoir , will give practically complete control of the floods . Consequently the river thru the El Paso-Juarez Valley will take on more the nature of a large central drain or canal than a river.

se corte de un país , sea igual a la que se corte del otro .
(b) El trazo hecho de acuerdo con este principio, dá lugar a que las zonas de derecho de vía que debe adquirir cada nación sean prácticamente iguales en extensión . En términos generales , el cauce artificial proyectado consistirá de un cauce de estiaje de dimensiones y capacidad semejantes a las del actual lecho menor del Río y de un cauce mayor limitado en ambos lados por diques distantes como 180 metros (590 pies ) uno de otro . Estos diques tendrán un ancho en corona bastante para permitir el tráfico para fines de inspección y reparación . El trazo se ha hecho procurando , en lo posible, no cruzar terrenos cultivados o con mejoras ; pero en algunos lugares ésto ha sido impracticable debido a las sinuosidades del Río .
(c) El proyecto de acortamiento del Río por cortes artificiales es factible porque el efecto combinado de las Presas del Elefante y de Caballo , será el de controlar casi por completo las crecientes, y en consecuencia el Río adquirirá más bien los carácteres de un gran canal central en el Valle de Juárez-El Paso.

(a ) The cost of the Caballo

two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($ 1,250.000) for the one hundred thousand ( 100,000 ) acre feet (123,350,000 cubic meters ) capacity .
(b) The volume of water passing the Caballo Damsite during the flood of September 1925 was in the neighborhood of twenty-five thousand (25,000 ) acre feet (30, 837,000 cubic meters) . Storage in excess of this amount must be

(a) In order that neither nation shall sacrifice national area, it is required that the total land to be segregated or cut off from one country shall equal that to be segregated or cut off from the other. On the attached maps these tracts and their total areas have been shown . Fifty-nine (59) separate tracts will be cut from Mexico and sixty-five (65 ) separate tracts will be cut from the United States . Their areas vary from 0.10 hectares ( .25 acre) to 151 hectares (377 acres). The approximate total area to be cut from Mexico is one thousand four hundred ( 1400 ) hectares (3460 acres) and the approximate total area to be cut from the United States is one thousand four hundred (1400 ) hectares (3460 acres) .

(a) A fin de que ninguno de los dos países sufra pérdida de territorio Nacional, se ha establecido como requisito fundamental que la extensión total de

(b) The river route , by following the present river, is located entirely in the United States and passes thru areas largely undrained and uncultivated, while the boundary route passes largely thru highly cultivated and valuable areas . Therefore the costs of rights-of-way will be less with the river route

(b) Como el trazo por el Río sigue el cauce actual de la corriente, queda enteramente en los Estados Unidos y atraviesa terrenos en su mayor parte incultos y sin drenaje, mientras que el trazo por el Límite Internacional cruza terrenos cultivados y valiosos. Por lo tanto , el costo del derecho de vía será menor si

and no areas will be segregated in the sense of changed national jurisdiction . The alignment possible with the bboouunnddaarryy route is considerably better than that
of the river route, especially at the lower end of the Island , where a sharp curve is necessary if the river route is used .

se sigue el trazo por el Río , y no habrá cambios de jurisdicción nacional en los terrenos por segregarr. El trazo por el Límite Internacional es notablemente
mejor que el trazo por el Río , principalmente en el extremo inferior de la Isla , en donde se
requiere una curva pronunciada en caso de seguir el trazo por el Río.

(c) The boundary route makes more feasible the carrying thru of irrigation and drainage works needed by Mexico , as the present boundary in places is located practically against the toe of the mesa. On the other hand, the abandonment of the river requires the building in the United States of a feeder canal to reestablish water deliveries to the Tornillo Canal system.
(d) The boundary route is estimated to cost about seventyfive thousand dollars ($ 75,000) more than the river route, due largely to the higher value of the lands required for the rightof-way and the segregated areas, and to the disestablishment of some of the irrigation and drainage works now constructed in the United Sates of America with the river in its present location. The equalizing of all the segregated tracts and the estimate submitted herewith both are based on following the boundary route along the San Elizario Island .

(c) El trazo por el Límite Internacional facilita la ejecución de obras de riego y de drenaje necesarias para México , pues el actual Límite Internacional en varios lugares toca el pie de las lomas. Por otra parte, el abandono del Río , exige la construcción en territorio de Estados Unidos, de un canal para abastecer de agua el actual sistema del canal de Tornillo .
(d) El trazo por el Límite Internacional costará como 75.000 dólares más que el trazo por el Río, principalmente por el mayor valor de los terrenos destinados a
derecho de vía y de las parcelas por segregar, y por la inutilización de algunas obras de riego y de drenaje que actualmente existen en esta zona de los Estados Unidos. En el proyecto que se presenta , la compensación de las áreas por segregar y el costo de las obras están estudiados para el trazo por el Límite Internacional en la Isla de San Elizario .

V.-GENERAL . 1.- Velocities .

V.-GENERAL . 1.-Velocidades.

Minute No. 129 ofIn-
ternational Boundary Commission- Contd.

(a) The requirements of the project indicate two important limiting velocities ; namely, that the maximum velocity in the flood
channel at full flow must not entail expensive bank protection, and that the minimum velocity in the normal flow channel must be
high enough to carry the annual increment of sand and silt to prevent channel upbuilding.
(b) The increase in average gradient, which is from .00035 to .00061 , or from 1.82 feet per mile to 3.2 feet per mile, and which is brought about by the shortening in the river length, will produce velocities of from five to six feet ( 1.52 to 1.83 meters) per second at full flow, depending on the cross section and the gradient of the particular section considered .
(c) These velocities ccaann be safely carried in the channel designed for this project where the alignment is reasonably straight and the cross section relatively wide .
(d) The data on normal flow indicates that the low water channel will have a velocity of around
three feet (0.91 meters) per second. Experience on the Rio Grande Irrigation Project, in the sluicing of canals in the design of sand skimming devices, has shown that such velocities are capable of carrying the usual sand and silt borne by the Rio Grande.

(a) Las necesidades del pro-
yecto establecen los siguientes límites de velocidad : La velocidad máxima en el cauce mayor a plena capacidad no debe motivar trabajos costosos de protección de los diques, y la velocidad mínima en el cauce de estiaje debe ser suficiente para acarrear el incremento anual de azolve a fin de evitar la elevación del cauce.
(b) El aumento de pendiente media de 0.00035 a 0.00061 (de 1.82 a 3.20 pies por milla) , que se obtendrá mediante el acortamiento de la longitud del Río , producirá velocidades a plena capacidad entre 1.52 y 1.83 metros por segundo (5 y 6 pies por segundo ) , de acuerdo con la sección transversal y la pendiente en el lugar que se considere.
(c) Estas velocidades máximas pueden alcanzarse sin peligro en el cauce que se ha proyectado , en vista de que el trazo está constituido por numerosos tramos rectos y las secciones transversales son relativamente anchas.
(d) Los cálculos hechos para el gasto de estiaje indican que la velocidad en el cauce menor será alrededor de 0.91 metros por segundo (3.0 pies por segundo) . Por experiencia se ha visto en el Sistema de Irrigación del Río Grande que esta velocidad tiene capacidad bastante para acarrear los sedimentos que comunmente lleve el Río Bravo .

2.-Coefficient of Roughness.

2.-Coeficiente de Rugosidad.

(a) The value of " n " in Kutter's Formula adopted for use on this project is n= .025 for the normal flow channel and n = .030 for the flood channel. These values follow closely those determined on the Miami Conservancy
District at Dayton, Ohio, taking such tests as are believed to nearly
duplicate the conditions to be encountered on this project. On one particular determination where the channel was covered with weeds , and the flow was

3.-Cross-sections

3.-Secciones Transversales.

(a) The cross-sections adopted as best suited to the requirements of the project are shown on the attached Exhibit No. 3. It will be noted that two cross-sections are shown. These are identical except in the placement of the normal flow channel . The one to be used from El Paso-Juarez to the lower end of the San Elizario Island places the normal flow channel in the center while the one to be used from the lower end of the San Elizario Island to the mouth of Quitman Canyon places the normal flow channel adjacent to the left levee . This different treatment of the two sections of the river is required because, in the upper part, the land passed thru in the making of cut-offs is generally low ground lying from only slightly above the proposed river grade to, in some cases, slightly below the proposed grade. Thru this section the amount of material to be excavated from the proposed new channel is small and

(a) Las secciones transversales adoptadas como más adecuadas para las exigencias de este proyecto, se muestran en el anexo No. 3. Podrá observarse que aparecen dos secciones transversales que difieren sólo en la posición del cauce de estiaje . En la Sección para el tramo comprendido entre Juárez-El Paso y el extremo inferior de la Isla de San Elizario, el cauce de estiaje está colocado en el centro , mientras que en la sección correspondiente al tramo comprendido entre el extremo inferior de la Isla de San Elizario y la entrada del Cañón de Quitman, el cauce de estiaje queda situado junto al dique del lado izquierdo. Esta diferencia en las secciones obedece a que en la parte superior, el terreno en que se harán los cortes es en general bajo, queda un poco más alto que la plantilla del cauce proyectado, y en algunos casos ligeramente más abajo. En este tramo el volumen de material que debera

can be wasted adjacent to the normal flow channel without seriously decreasing flood channel capacities. Throughout the lower section deeper cuts are encountered and spoiling into the flood channel is impracticable. This changed condition is met by placing the normal channel adjacent to the left levee where the material excavated can be placed to form the left levee or can be wasted beyond the flood channel.

excavarse para formar el cauce menor proyectado , es relativamente pequeño y puede depositarse a los lados del cauce de estiaje sin que por ellos disminuya seriamente la capacidad del cauce mayor. En cambio , en el tramo inferior los cortes son más profundos y no puede hacerse dentro del cauce mayor el depósito del material excavado , por lo que se ha pensado colocar el cauce de estiaje adyacente al dique izquierdo y poder así aprovechar el material excavado en la construc-

ción de este dique o moverlo hasta afuera del cauce mayor.

(b) The proposed cross-section has levees spaced 180 meters (590 feet) apart with levee heights of

(b ) En las secciones transversales proyectadas, los diques distan 180 metros (590 pies) y su

RECTIFICATION OF THE RIO GRANDE - MEXICO. FEB. 1 , 1933. 1655

about 2.2 meters (7.2 feet ) . In actual construction levee heights will vary from nothing, where bench lands are encountered, to four and a half meters (15 feet) where the old river channel is crossed . The levee section proposed has a five meter (16.4 feet) crown with side slopes of two to one. This will permit the use of the top as a road for inspection and repair.
(c) The normal flow channel is designed with a bottom width of twenty meters (66 feet) as this channel width seems to best fit the present channel width of the river. Side slopes are 1 : 1 except throughout the lower section where 2: 1 slope is proposed on the side adjacent to the left levee.
(d) Gradients vary from .00045 (2.38 feet per mile) to .0008 (4.26 feet per mile) and the levee heights have been changed to conform, always adding 0.6 meters (2 feet) as freeboard.
(e) The estimated capacity below the 0.6 meters (2 feet) freeboard varies from ten thousand seven hundred (10,700) second feet (3,030 cubic meters per second) to eleven thousand five hundred (11,500 ) second feet (3,260 cubic meters per second) .

altura media es de 2.25 metros Minute No. 129ofInternational Boundary
(7.2 pies) . En la práctica, las Commission-Contd. alturas de los diques variarán
desde cero , en donde haya terreno alto , hasta 4.5 metros (15 pies) en los cruzamientos del cauce viejo del Río . Según el proyecto , la sección de los diques tiene 5 metros en la corona (16.4 pies) , con taludes de dos por uno . En estas condiciones se podrán usar las coronas como camino para fines de inspección y reparación .
(c) El cauce de estiaje proyectado tiene un ancho en el fondo de 20 metros (66 pies), que es el que parece concordar mejor con el del cauce actual del Río . Los taludes son de uno por uno, y solamente en el tramo inferior se proyecta un talud de dos por uno en el lado adyacente al dique izquierdo .
(d) Las pendientes varían
desde 0.00045 hasta 0.00080 (2.37 a 4.26 pies por milla) y las alturas de los diques se han ajustado a la pendiente del cauce, aumentando siempre una altura de 0.60 metros (2 pies) como margen de seguridad .
(e) La capacidad calculada para el cauce hasta una altura de 0.60 metros (2 pies) abajo de la corona de los diques, varía entre 3030 y 3260 metros cúbicos por segundo ( 10.700 y 11.500 pies cúbicos por segundo) .

4.-Right-of-way.

4.-Derecho de Vía.

(a) The total right-of-way required is eight thousand one hundred sixty (8,160) acres (3,300 hectares) . This is equally divided between the two countries to Mexico four thousand eighty (4,080) acres ( 1650 hectares ) and to the United States four thousand eighty (4,080) acres ( 1650 hectares). In addition to the land actually occupied by the works, a strip fifteen meters (49 feet) wide outside the land tow of each levee has been included for
use in levee maintenance or possible future levee widening.

(a) La extensión total necesaria de terreno para derecho de vía es de 3.300 hectáras (8160 acres ) , repartida por mitad entre los dos países , correspondiendo a México 1650 hectáras (4080 acres) y a los Estados Unidos 1650 hectáras (4080 acres) . El derecho de vía incluye, además del terreno ocupado por las obras, una faja de 15 metros (49 pies) de ancho contada desde el pie del talud del lado de tierra de cada dique, y que se destina a la conservación o a la
ampliación futura de los diques .

1656 RECTIFICATION OF THE RIO GRANDE - MEXICO . FEB. 1 , 1933 .

Minute No. 129 of In- 5. -Clearing. ternational Boundary Commission- Contd.
(a) The area to be cleared is

estimated as seventy per cent of the total area required for the

right-of-way. A part of the right-

of-way is now cleared and in culti-

vation, and in addition a consider-

able part is now occupied by the

present river.

Unit cost is

sixty-two dollars fifty cents per hectare , or about twenty-five dollars per acre. The work to be done consists of brush cutting, some grubbing, and the plowing of the area between the borrow pits and the normal channel.

5.-Desmonte .
(a ) Se estima necesario desmontar el 70 por ciento de la extensión total del derecho de
vía, pues parte de esa faja está actualmente en cultivo y otra parte considerable está ocupada por el cauce actual del Río . Se ha calculado un costo de 62.50 dólares por hectára (25 dólares por acre) para este trabajo, que consistirá en cortar las yerbas desenraizar y arar la parte comprendida entre las zanjas de préstamo y el canal de estiaje.

6.-Earthwork.

6.-Terracerías.

(a) All earthwork of both chan-

nel excavation and levee em-

bankment is planned to be ac-

complished by machine methods, and the unit cost used in the

estimates is eighteen cents per cubic meter which is about that

developed on similar work in that

locality .

The machines best

suited to the work are draglines

equipped with one hundred foot

booms, with buckets from two to

three cubic yards in capacity,

although on a great part of the levee work smaller equipment can be used economically. Proper

provision has been made in the

unit cost for full machine upkeep and depreciation, and for the

hazards of the work such as

untimely high water, soft and

marshy ground and unusable soft material .

(b) It is planned to secure material for the levee embankment from the channel excavation
in building the left levee from the lower end of San Elizario Island to the mouth of Quitman Canyon. At practically all the other locations the material will be secured from discontinuous borrow pits located on the channel side of the levees. Practically no material will require a second handling .

(a) Todo el trabajo de terracerías, tanto el correspondiente a la excavación del cauce, como a los terraplenes de los diques, se hará empleando excavadoras ; habiéndose aceptado un costo unitario en el presupuesto , de 18 centavos de dólar por metro cúbico , costo análogo al obtenido en trabajos semejantes en la localidad . Las máquinas más adecuadas para el trabajo serán palas o dragas mecánicas provistas de
plumas de cien pies de longitud y cucharones de dos a tres yardas cúbicas de capacidad, aunque en algunas partes de los diques puede usarse con economía equipo más chico . Al fijar el precio unitario se han incluido partidas correspondientes a reparaciones, depreciación de maquinaria y circunstancias imprevistas, como crecientes extemporáneas, terreno flojo y pantanoso, y material escurridizo e inútil.
(b ) En el tramo comprendido desde el extremo inferior de la Isla de San Elizario hasta la entrada del cañón de Quitman, se proyecta emplear el material de excavación del cauce para construir el dique izquierdo . En todos los demás casos , el material se tomará de zanjas de préstamo interrumpidas situadas del lado del Río de los diques . En la práctica no será necesario el doble traspaleo del material.

7.-Work near El Paso-Juarez.
(a) The item of one hundred twenty five thousand dollars (125,000) covers contemplated work on the section of river between International Dam and Cordova Island, and includes the extension and straightening of the present levees, the removal of existing obstructions, and purchase of title to all lands lying on the channel side of the present levees .

7.-Obras cerca de Juárez-El Paso . Minute No. 129 ofInternational Boundary Commission- Contd.
(a) En el presupuesto figura una partida de 125.000 dólares
destinada a las obras que se consideran necesarias en el tramo
del Río comprendido entre la Presa Internacional y el Corte de Córdova, tales como la prolongación y el refuerzo de los
diques actuales y la remoción de las obstrucciones existentes y a la
adquisición del título de propiedad sobre todos los terrenos
particulares que ahora quedan dentro del cauce entre los diques.

8.-Changes in Canals and Drains . 8.-Cambios en los Canales y en los Drenes.

(a) The sum of two hundred twenty five thousand dollars ($225,000 ) is carried in the estimate to cover the cost of rebuilding all constructed irrigation and drainage works where they will be interfered with by the proposed river work. This work will include the rearrangement of the irrigation systems on both sides of the river, especially in the area below Monument No. 1 of San Elizario Island , and changed drain outlets on the United States side in the same area. The sum of seventy-five thousand dollars has been allocated to Mexico and one
hundred fifty thousand dollars to the United States .

(a) En el presupuesto aparece
la suma de 225.000 dólares para cubrir los gastos de reconstrucción de las obras de riego y drenaje ahora existentes que resulten afectadas con los trabajos de rectificación proyectados . Estas obras incluyen la readaptación de los sistemas de riego en ambos lados del Río, especialmente en la región abajo del monumento No. 1 de la Isla de San Elizario, y los cambios de desagues de los drenes en el lado Americano en la
misma región. Se ha asignado a México la suma de 75.000 dólares y a los Estados Unidos 150.000 dólares .

9.- Bridges .

9.-Puentes .

(a) Present bridges will either have to be lengthened or moved, depending on how they fit with the new plan and probably several more bridges will have to be built. The estimate of the amount of this item is three hundred thousand dollars . ($300.000) .

(a) Será necesario alargar o cambiar de sitio varios de los Puentes existentes para adaptarlos al nuevo cauce y además será tal vez necesario construir varios puentes nuevos . Para estos ob-
jetos se ha incluido una partida de 300.000 dólares .

10.-Grade Controls.

10.-Estructuras de Control de la Pendiente.

(a) Because the effects of the introduction of steeper gradients in the river channel are problematical, and considerable scour may develop, and because the irrigation supply must be diverted at certain places , there has been set up in the estimate

(a) Teniendo en cuenta que
los efectos del aumento de pendiente del cauce del río no pueden precisarse de antemano , y que pudieran ocurrir socavaciones ; y considerando también que debe derivarse agua para riego en determinados lugares, se ha hecho

11.-Engineering, Contingencies and 11. Dirección Técnica, Adminis-

Overhead.

tración e Imprevistos.

(a) An allowance of twenty per cent has been added to cover the cost of the above item. A
relatively low engineering cost should result, due to the magnitude of the quantities involved . Contingencies are not serious, as the flow of the river is largely controlled by Elephant Butte Dam, and no long-lasting floods are probable. Overhead should be no higher than on other similar work.

(a) Por estos conceptos se ha aumentado al costo de las obras el 20 % . Los gastos por concepto de dirección técnica serán bajos, debido a la magnitud de las obras. Las contingencias no serán muy serias, dado que el Río está regularizado por la Presa del Elefante y no es probable que ocurran crecientes de larga duración . Los gastos de administración no serán mayores que en obras semejantes.

VI.-COST WITHOUT CA- VI.- COSTO SIN LA PRESA

BALLO DAM.

DE CABALLO.

(a) During December 1928 , a report was made on the probable floods at El Paso-Juarez, with and without, the additional flood control of a retention reservoir at Caballo. The data then available indicated a maximum flood of eight thousand (8.000 ) second feet (226 cubic meters per second) with the Caballo Dam, and a maximum flood of eighteen thousand second feet (510 cubic meters per second) without the Caballo Dam. Since that time additional
data has been acquired , and restudies have shown that the assumed maximum flood with the Caballo Dam should be eleven thousand second feet (314 cubic meters per second) , and that the assumed maximum flood with-
out the Caballo Dam should be twenty thousand second feet (576 cubic meters per second) .

(a) En diciembre de 1928 se hizo un estudio comparativo de gastos de crecientes probables frente a Juárez-El Paso considerando dos casos : 1o . Que se construyera el vaso de retención de Caballo y 20. Que no se construyera este vaso . Los datos
entonces disponibles indicaban que en caso de construirse la Presa de Caballo el gasto máximo de crecientes podría ser de 226 metros cúbicos (8.000 pies cúbicos) por segundo ; y que en caso de no construirse esa presa el gasto máximo de crecientes podría ser de 510 metros cúbicos
( 18.000 pies cúbicos) por segundo . Datos recogidos posteriormente y estudios más recientes, han aconsejado tomar como gastos máximos de crecientes, los de 314 metros cúbicos (11.000 pies cúbicos) por segundo , con la presa de Caballo y 576 metros cúbicos (20.000 pies cúbicos) por segundo , sin la presa de Caballo .

the canyon below Fort Quitman will cost about one million five hundred thousand dollars more when designed for the twenty thousand second foot (576 cubic meters per second) channel than when designed for the eleven thousand second foot (314 cubic meters per second) channel. The principal items of difference are the increase in rights-of-way required due to the widening between levees in the upper part, or from El Paso-Juarez to the

monumento número uno de la línea terrestre hasta la entrada del cañón abajo de Fort Quitman implicaría un costo excedente como de 1.500,000 dólares cuando se proveyera un cauce de 576 metros cúbicos (20.000 pies cúbicos) por segundo , sobre el costo correspondiente a un cauce de 314 metros cúbicos (11.000 pies cúbicos ) por segundo . Esta diferencia se debe principalmente al aumento en la superficie del terreno destinado a derecho de

Alamo Arroyo ; the increase in earthwork, due principally to the larger cross-section needed thru the deep cuts below the Alamo Arroyo, and to the lengthening of the grade control structures and the bridges. There is also an increase in the amount of clearing necessary .
(d ) The additional area required for rights-of-way is about eight hundred hectares (2,000 acres) and will cost one hundred thousand dollars. The additional

También se aumenta el área por desmontar.
(d) El área adicional para derecho de vía es como de 800 hectáras (2000 acres), con un
costo de 100.000 dólares . El volumen adicional de terracerías

earthwork required is about four million one hundred fifty thousand cubic meters (5,424,000 cubic yards) which at eighteen cents per cubic meter amounts to seven hundred forty-seven thousand

Minute No. 129 of In- dollars. The lengthening of ternational Boundary Commission-Contd. grade control structures and
bridges will cost an additional three hundred fifty thousand dollars. The additional clearing required will cost thirty-five thousand dollars. The total of the above items is one million two hundred thirty-two thousand dollars which, when increased by twenty per cent allowed for engineering, overhead and contingencies, makes a total additional cost
of one million four hundred eighty thousand dollars.
(e) Therefore, the cost ($ 1 ,250,000) of the Caballo Dam is more than offset by the economies made possible in the works from Land Monument No. 1 to the mouth of Quitman Canyon . Indeed, a saving of two hundred
fifty thousand dollars is achieved. This saving is in addition to a reduction of 800 hectares (2,000
acres) in the land used for the channel which would be other-
wise irredeemably lost for cultivation, and to an unknown amount annually saved in less expensive maintenance .

control de la pendiente y de los puentes importaría la suma adicional de 350,000 dólares . Por concepto de desmontes se aumentarían 35.000 dólares. El total de las cantidades anteriores es de 1.232.000 dólares, y si a esta cantidad se agrega el 20% por concepto de dirección , administración e imprevistos, el costo total adicional sería de 1.480.000 dólares .
(e) Así pues, se ve que el costo de la Presa de Caballo , que es de 1.250,000 dólares , resulta ampliamente compensado por las economías que pueden hacerse en las obras entre el Monumento No. 1 de la línea terrestre y la entrada del Cañón de Quitman, lográndose un ahorro de 250.000 dólares. Además de este ahorro, se disminuye en 800 hectáras (2000 acres) la extensión de terreno que, por formar parte del cauce, resultaría irremisiblemente perdida para el cultivo y a la vez se ahorra por concepto de gastos de conservación una cantidad anual cuyo monto no puede precisarse.

NATIONAL FIRE PREVENTION WEEK- 1933 BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

A PROCLAMATION

National Fire Prevention Week, 1933.

It has been a commendable custom for the President of the United

Preamble.

States to request the annual observance of Fire Prevention Week

throughout the country. It is a week set aside for the purpose of in-

forming the public of the dangers of fire to life and property. Fires

which are largely preventable take a cruel toll of many lives and de-

stroy property exceeding $400,000,000 in value each year. Of late,

progress has been made in reducing the Nation's fire loss, and this

fact should encourage continuous vigilance and alertness so necessary

to decrease the hazards of fire.

I , Franklin D. Roosevelt, President of the United States of America, beTrh3u0r,sd19a3y3,, seNtovaseimd-e
do set aside and appoint Thursday, the thirtieth day of November as Thanksgiving Day. 1933 , to be a Day of Thanksgiving for all our people.
May we on that day in our churches and in our homes give humble thanks for the blessings bestowed upon us during the year past by Almighty God .
May we recall the courage of those who settled a wilderness, the Recommendations. vision of those who founded the nation , the steadfastness of those who in every succeeding generation have fought to keep pure the ideal of equality of opportunity and hold clear the goal of mutual help in time of prosperity as in time of adversity.
May we ask guidance in more surely learning the ancient truth that
greed and selfishness and striving for undue riches can never bring lasting happiness or good to the individual or to his neighbors .
May we be grateful for the passing of dark days ; for the new spirit of dependence one on another; for the closer unity of all parts of our wide land ; for the greater friendship between employers and those who toil ; for a clearer knowledge by all nations that we seek no conquests and ask only honorable engagements by all peoples to respect the lands and rights of their neighbors ; for the brighter day to which we can win through by seeking the help of God in a more unselfish striving for the common bettering of mankind.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States to be affixed .
DONE at the City of Washington this twenty-first day of November, in the year of our Lord Nineteen hundred and thirty-

WHEREAS it appears from a certificate issued December 5, 1933,

dent of the United States of America, pursuant to the provisions of

section 217 (a) of the said act of June 16, 1933 , do hereby proclaim

that the eighteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United

States was repealed on the fifth day of December 1933 .

FURTHERMORE,

I

enjoin

upon

all

citizens

of the

United

States

Cooperation for greater respect for law

and upon others resident within the jurisdiction thereof to cooperate and order enjoined. with the Government in its endeavor to restore greater respect for

law and order, by confining such purchases of alcoholic beverages as they may make solely to those dealers or agencies which have been duly licensed by State or Federal license .
Observance of this request, which I make personally to every individual and every family in our Nation, will result in the consumption of alcoholic beverages which have passed Federal inspection , in the break-up and eventual destruction of the notoriously evil illicit liquor traffic, and in the payment of reasonable taxes for the support of Government and thereby in the superseding of other forms of taxation .
I call specific attention to the authority given by the twenty-first amendment to the Government to prohibit transportation or importation of intoxicating liquors into any State in violation of the laws of such State.

I ask the whole-hearted cooperation of all our citizens to the end that this return of individual freedom shall not be accompanied by

the repugnant conditions that obtained prior to the adoption of the eighteenth amendment and those that have existed since its adoption. Failure to do this honestly and courageously will be a living reproach to us all.

I ask especially that no State shall by law or otherwise authorize the return of the saloon either in its old form or in some modern guise .
The policy of the Government will be to see to it that the social and political evils that have existed in the pre-prohibition era shall not be revived nor permitted again to exist. We must remove forever from our midst the menace of the bootlegger and such others as would profit at the expense of good government, law, and order.
I trust in the good sense of the American people that they will not bring upon themselves the curse of excessive use of intoxicating liquors, to the detriment of health, morals, and social integrity.
The objective we seek through a national policy is the education of every citizen towards a greater temperance throughout the Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed .

DONE at the City of Washington this fifth day of December, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and thirty-three, and of

"Whenever the President finds, upon investigation, that ( 1 ) the foreign commerce of the United States is adversely affected by reason

of the depreciation in the value of the currency of any other govern-

ment or governments in relation to the present standard value of gold, or (2) action under this section is necessary in order to regulate and

maintain the parity of currency issues of the United States, or (3 ) an

economic emergency requires an expansion of credit, or (4) an expansion of credit is necessary to secure by international agreement a stabilization at proper levels of the currencies of various governments, the President is authorized , in his discretion-

"(a) To direct the Secretary of the Treasury to enter into agreements with the several Federal Reserve banks and with the Federal

Reserve Board whereby the Federal Reserve Board will , and it is

hereby authorized to , notwithstanding any provisions of law or rules and regulations to the contrary, permit such reserve banks to agree

that they will , ( 1 ) conduct, pursuant to existing law, throughout specified periods , open market operations in obligations of the United States Government or corporations in which the United States is the

majority stockholder, and (2) purchase directly and hold in portfolio for an agreed period or periods of time Treasury bills or other obligations of the United States Government in an aggregate sum of

$3,000,000,000 in addition to those they may then hold, unless prior to the termination of such period or periods the Secretary shall consent to their sale. No suspension of reserve requirements of the Fed-

eral Reserve banks, under the terms of section 11 (c) of the Federal Reserve Act, necessitated by reason of operations under this section,

shall require the imposition of the graduated tax upon any deficiency in reserves as provided in said section 11 (c) . Nor shall it require any automatic increase in the rates of interest or discount charged by any Federal Reserve bank, as otherwise specified in that section . The Federal Reserve Board, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, may require the Federal Reserve banks to take such action

as may be necessary, in the judgment of the Board and of the Secretary of the Treasury, to prevent undue credit expansion .
"(b) If the Secretary, when directed by the President, is unable to secure the assent of the several Federal Reserve banks and the Federal

Reserve Board to the agreements authorized in this section, or if operations under the above provisions prove to be inadequate to meet the purposes of this section, or if for any other reason additional

measures are required in the judgment of the President to meet such purposes, then the President is authorized-

agreement with any government or governments under the terms of which the ratio between the value of gold and other currency issued
by the United States and by any such government or governments is established, the President may fix the weight of the gold dollar in accordance with the ratio so agreed upon, and such gold dollar, the weight of which is so fixed , shall be the standard unit of value, and all forms of money issued or coined by the United States shall be
maintained at a parity with this standard and it shall be the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury to maintain such parity, but in no event shall the weight of the gold dollar be fixed so as to reduce its present weight by more than 50 per centum . Nor shall the weight of the gold dollar be fixed in any event at more than 60 per centum of its present weight. The powers of the President specified in this paragraph shall be deemed to be separate, distinct, and continuing powers, and may be exercised by him, from time to time, severally or together, whenever and as the expressed objects of this section in his judgment may require ; except that such powers shall expire two years after the Duration of powers date of enactment of the Gold Reserve Act of 1934 unless the President conferred.

with dated the Netherlands forthe

January 20, 1931 ,¹ enclosing copies of the Netherland Shipping Act roefcliopardoclailne creerctoigfniciattieosn.

and Royal Decree and Order in Council relating to load lines for the consideration of this Government in relation to its proposal to the

Netherland Government to conclude a reciprocal load line agreement

with this Government pending the coming into force of the International Load Line Convention.

Note has been made of the Legation's statement that the laws, rules

and regulations pertaining to load lines for vessels now enforced by

the Netherland Government are identical with those enforced by the Government of Great Britain , with the sole exception of the rules and regulations pertaining to the carriage of deck cargoes of wood goods.
The competent authorities of this Government consider that the 1906 rules of the British Board of Trade, concerning load lines, are

as effective as the United States Load Line Regulations for the determination of load lines on ordinary merchant vessels. The rules of the Netherland Government for determining the load lines of vessels with wood cargoes have been examined by these authorities and have likewise been found to be as effective as the rules contained in the

United States Load Line Regulations applicable to vessels carrying wood cargo on deck.
Pending the coming into effect of the International Load Line Convention in the United States and the Netherlands, the competent

authorities of the Government of the United States are prepared to recognize the load line marks and the certificate of such marking of merchant vessels of the competent authorities of the Netherland Gov-

ernment as equivalent to their own load line marks and certificates of marking : provided, that the load line marks are in accordance

with the load line certificates ; that the hull and superstructures of

the vessel certificated have not been so materially altered since the issuance of the certificate, as to affect calculations on which the load line was based, and that alterations have not been made so that the-

It will be understood that on the receipt of a note from you to the

effect that the competent authorities of the Netherland Government

will give full recognition to the load line marks made and the cer-

tificates issued by the competent authorities of this Government and

expressing the Netherland Government's concurrence in the foregoing understanding, the reciprocal agreement will become effective.

LÉGATION DES PAYS-BAS. Washington, D.C. , 18 March 1932.

Pursuant to instructions received from my Government, I have the honor to enclose herewith copy of the Royal Decree of January 29,

1932,³ (Official Gazette No. 25) regarding load line regulations in the Netherlands, purporting modification of the Royal Decree of September 22, 1909, which was amended last by Royal Decree of Novem-

ber 4, 1926 and copy of which was transmitted to Your Excellency by my note of January 20, 1931, No. 113.*

According to this new Decree in certain cases a somewhat more lenient rule may be adopted in the Netherlands with regard to load line marks, provided this will not endanger ship and crew and will be

in conformity with the minimum requirements as stipulated in the International Load Line Convention of London of July 5, 1930.

I may remark at the same time that the Netherland Government, according to this measure, has already put into force the stipulations of the London Convention before it has been ratified.

Please accept, Sir, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration .

SIR :

Washington, April 22, 1932.

I have the honor to refer to your note No. 3956, dated November 16, 1931 , and likewise to your note No. 935 of March 18, 1932, both of which relate to the proposed load-line agreement between the Governments of the United States and the Netherlands.

It is noted that the Government of the Netherlands has designated

the following bureaus as private investigation bureaus recognized in accordance with the " Schepenwet " (Netherlands Merchant Shipping Act of July 1 , 1909) :

1. Lloyd's Register of British and Foreign Shipping ; 2. British Corporation for the survey and registry of shipping ; 3. Bureau Veritas ; 4. Germanischer Lloyd ; 5. Det Norske Veritas.

The United States Government is willing to recognize the loadline certificates issued by the aforementioned classification societies to merchant ships of the Netherlands when they are issued under the authority thus granted by the Netherland Government.
This Government has authorized the marking of load- lines and the issuance of certificates therefor, on American vessels, by the American Bureau of Shipping, the American Committee of Lloyd's Registry of Shipping, and the American representatives of the Bureau Veritas.
The Government of the United States is also willing to recognize the certificates issued by the Netherland Government pursuant to the Royal Decree of January 29, 1932,5 (Official Gazette No. 25 ) which amends certain regulations under the Shipping Law of the Netherlands so as to allow the assignment of smaller freeboards than hitherto authorized provided it can be done without danger to ship and crew, and that the freeboards so assigned are in accordance with the provisions contained in the International Load Line Convention of July 5, 1930.
Note has been taken of Royal Decree No. 414 of October 8, 1931 ," by which the provisions in force in the United States in regard to the minimum water-line as established under the law of March 2 , 1929, will be recognized by the Netherland Government. It is the view of this Government , therefore, that the agreement for the recog-

These classification bureaux, when recognized by the Netherland Government, act on the subject of the marking of loadlines and the issuance of certificates, only in advisory capacity ; however, the advice of the majority of these bureaux is generally followed .
I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to you Sir, the assurances of my highest consideration.

The effect of the provisions of Article 7 is to establish the right of citizens of the United States in France to enjoy the same treatment as French citizens in matters relating to the ownership, possession and

Accordingly, citizens of the United States are entitled, to enjoy in France the benefit of all the provisions, whether applicable to owners or tenants, contained in the French law of April 1 , 1926 , as amended by the law of June 29 , 1929 , governing the relations between lessors and lessees of premises used for residential pur-

poses, and in the law of June 30 , 1926 , as amended by the law of April 22, 1927, governing the relations between tenants and landlords of

premises used for commercial or industrial purposes , notwithstanding Article 11 of the Civil Code and the exceptions or restrictions applicable to foreigners under the aforesaid laws.
I may add that, under the laws of the states of the United States and the District of Columbia, French citizens in the United States enjoy the same treatment as American citizens with regard to the leasing and renting of real property.

J'ai l'honneur d'informer Votre Excellence que le Gouvernement français accepte, pour l'application future de la Convention, l'inter-

Les dispositions de l'article 7 ont pour effet d'assurer aux citoyens des Etats-Unis résidant en France le droit de jouir du même traite-

ment que les citoyens français en matière de propriété, de possession

et de disposition de biens immeubles . En conséquence, les citoyens des Etats-Unis jouiront en France du bénéfice de toutes les disposi-

française du 1er avril 1926 , modifiée par celle du 29 juin 1929 , régissant les relations entre bailleurs et preneurs de locaux à usage d'habi-

MR. AMBASSADOR,

By a letter of the 23d of last month you acquainted me with your

Government's interpretation of article 7 of the consular convention

concluded on February 23, 1853 , between France and the United

States of America, dealing with the rights of American citizens in France in relation to the French rent law.

I have the honor to inform Your Excellency that the French Gov-

ernment accepts, for the future application of the convention, the following interpretation, already valid in the past.
The effect of the provisions of article 7 is to secure for citizens of the United States residing in France the right to enjoy the same treatment as French citizens in matters relating to the ownership, possession, and disposal of real property . Consequently, citizens of the United States will enjoy in France the benefit of all the provisions , whether applicable to owners or tenants, of the French law of April 1 , 1926, amended by the law of June 29 , 1929, governing the relations between lessors and lessees of premises used for residential purposes ,

and the law of June 30, 1926 , amended by the law of April 22, 1927 ,

governing the relations between tenants and landlords of premises used for commercial and industrial purposes, notwithstanding article

11 of the Civil Code and the exceptions or restrictions applicable to foreigners under the aforesaid laws.

I take note that, under the laws of the different States of the United States and of the District of Columbia, French citizens residing in the United States enjoy the same treatment as American citizens in regard to the leasing or renting of real property.
Kindly accept, Mr. Ambassador, the assurances of my very high consideration .

I särskilda fall må vederbörande myndighet tillåta luftfartyg att landa å eller starta från annan flygplats, varest möjlighet till tullbehandling, immigration och klarering ordnats . Förbudet mot mellanlandning avser även sådana fall.
Har nödlandning ägt rum utanför flygplats, som omförmäles i första stycket av denna artikel, skola luftfartygets förare, dess besättning och passagerare ställa sig till efterrättelse de tull- och immigrationsbestämmelser , som gälla inom det område, varest landningen ägt rum .
Luftfartyg hemmahörande i en av de fördragsslutande staterna, skola hava rätt att inkomma å den andra partens område , under förutsättning att de ställa sig till efterrättelse därstädes gällande karantänsföreskrifter .

ARTIKEL 14 .
Envar av de fördragsslutande parterna förbehåller sig rätt att fordra, att alla luftfartyg, som överskrida gränserna för dess område, skola göra det antingen mellan vissa punkter eller i närheten av en tullflygplats inom dess område, på sådan höjd att signalering kan uppfattas , även om luftfartyget icke där landar . De kontraherande parterna skola underrätta varandra om de punkter , varest , i enlighet med vad sålunda bestämts , deras respektive gränser må passeras .
Det förutsättes , att ingen av de föreskrifter rörande inflygningsleder, vilka omförmälas i föregående stycke, befriar luftfartyg, som passerar endera partens gränser, från skyldighet att landa å flygplats , som, enligt bestämmelserna i artikel 13, är fastställd såsom inflygningsort .

DEPARTMENT OF STATE,

Agreement United States.

Washington, January 9, 1934.
SIR : by
In a note dated August 24, 1933, Mr. Macaulay, as Chargé d'Af-
faires ad interim, brought to the notice of the Government of the

United States the provisions of Section 10 of the Irish Free State Finance Act of 1932 , which provides for the relief of American

steamship owners from double income tax on shipping profits.

The text of Section 10 of the above law was brought to the attention of the Secretary of the Treasury, with the request that he inform

Vol . 47, pp. 228, 230. the Department of State whether the Irish Free State satisfied the

equivalent exemption requirements of Sections 212 ( b ) and 231 ( b )

DOUBLE INCOME TAX-IRISH FREE STATE .
of the United States Revenue Act of 1932. I have pleasure in informing you that I am now in receipt of a letter from the Acting Secretary of the Treasury dated December 14, 1933, which reads in part as follows :
" In view of the fact that the Irish Free State, under the provision of law quoted above, exempts from income tax so much of the income of a citizen of the United States not resident in the Irish Free State or of a corporation organized in the United States as is derived from the operation of a ship or ships documented under the laws of the United States, it is the opinion of this Department that the Irish Free State meets the reciprocal exemption provisions of sections 212 (b ) and 231 ( b ) of the Revenue Act of 1932. The income of a non-resident alien individual and of a foreign corporation which consists exclusively of earnings derived from the operation of a ship or ships documented under the laws of the Irish Free State is, therefore, not required to be included in gross income and is exempt from income tax under the provisions of the Revenue Act of 1932. The exemption accorded herein is effective April 6, 1932, the beginning of the first income-tax taxable year to which Section 10 of the Finance Act of 1932 is applicable."
It will be observed that the Acting Secretary of the Treasury holds that in view of the fact that the Irish Free State, under the provisions of Section 10 of the Irish Free State Finance Act of 1932 , exempts from income tax so much of the income of a citizen of the United States not resident in the Irish Free State or of a corporation organized in the United States as is derived from the operation of a ship or ships documented under the laws of the United States, the Irish Free State has satisfied the equivalent exemption provisions of Sections 212 ( b ) and 231 ( b ) of the United States Revenue Act of 1932. The exemption accorded to steamship owners of the Irish Free State under the above ruling of the Acting Secretary of the Treasury is effective as of April 6, 1932 , the beginning of the first income-tax taxable year to which Section 10 of the Irish Free State Finance Act of 1932 is applicable.
Accept, Sir, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration. For the Acting Secretary of State : R. WALTON MOORE

condition of reciprocity, is prepared to grant freedom from taxation rmoocbaillterse. atment of autofor a period of 3 months to foreign automobiles built for the transportation of passengers not to exceed 7 in number including the driver,

and belonging in the country in question and registered as the property of persons residing there.
In these circumstances I would be greatly obliged to you for being so good as to let me know, what formalities and conditions must be complied with in order that motor vehicles registered in Denmark may be exempted from taxation in the United States, therein included duties and taxes of all kinds .

SIR :

Washington, October 27, 1928.

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your note of Septem- StaRteessp. onse by United ber 4, 1928 , in which you were good enough to inform me that your Government, on the basis of reciprocity, is prepared to grant freedom from taxation for a period of three months to foreign automobiles built for transportation of passengers not to exceed seven in number, including the driver, and belonging in the country in question and registered as the property of persons residing there.

PASSENGER MOTOR VEHICLES- DENMARK.

In reply I have the honor to inform you that the Federal Government imposes no taxes on automobiles in the United States . The taxation of owners of automobiles and the exaction of fees for the
registration of automobiles is a matter for determination by the several States . The Department has been informally advised that an investigation of the motor vehicle laws of the forty-eight States of the United States discloses the fact that all of them grant reciprocity to foreign visitors.
This reciprocity is granted in respect both to the license plate and the driving license, provided , of course, that the same reciprocity is extended by foreign countries to residents of States that are now granting this courtesy . With regard to the taxation of owners of automobiles which is usually distinct from the payment of a registration fee, it may be stated that it is the Department's understanding that as a general rule such taxes are only imposed upon persons who are found to be legal residents of a certain State. Such taxes, it is believed, would not be exacted from persons who are merely touring through the several States of the Union, the class of persons to whom, presumably, reference is made in your note under acknowledgment .
In this connection the following information regarding the freedom from customs duties granted on a reciprocal basis to motorcycles and automobiles brought into the United States by nonresidents for a period of not more than six months, quoted from a letter from the Treasury Department, would appear pertinent to your inquiry:
"The regulations governing such importations are contained in Chapter VIII, Customs Regulations of 1923 , Articles 406-413 . Article 407 provides that entry shall be made on Customs Form 7501 , and that bond shall be given on Customs Form 7563 (with surety) in a penal sum equal to double the estimated duties . In lieu of such bond, the importer may deposit a cash amount equal to the estimated duties, which is treated as a cash bond . The entry will be liquidated free of duty, and the bond canceled or the amount deposited returned, if the vehicle in question is exported within the six months period prescribed by Section 308 and provided that exportation is made in the manner required by Article 412 of the regulations . When not so exported, the vehicles are treated in the same manner as similar articles imported for sale and consumption, and assessed for duty on their value at the time of importation . The six months period prescribed for exportation cannot be extended . "

I have the honor to express the hope that in the light of the fore-

going information the competent Danish authorities will be prepared to grant reciprocal treatment to American citizens desiring to drive automobiles in Denmark.

Accept, Sir, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration .

(b) Notwithstanding anything previously stated in this Article, it is understood that if the Government of India should after the date
of this agreement sell silver to any Government for the purpose of transfer to the United States Government in payment of war debts such silver shall be excluded from the scope of this agreement ;
