Whereas it is found expedient, for the better administration of jus-
tice and the prevention of crime within the territories and jurisdiction of the parties, respectively, that persons committing certain heinous crimes, being fugitives from justice, should, under certain circumstances,
be reciprocally delivered up; and also to enumerate such crimes explicitly ; and whereas the laws and constitution of Baden do not allow its government to surrender its own citizens to a foreign jurisdiction, the government of the United States, with a view of making the convention strictly reciprocal, shall be held equally free from any obligation to surrender citizens of the United States: therefore, on the one part, the United States of America, and on the other part, his Royal Highness the Grand Duke of Baden, having resolved to treat on this subject, have, for that purpose, appointed their respective plenipotentiaries to negotiate and conclude a convention; that is to say, the President of the United States of America, Peter D.

within the territories of the other : Provided, That this shall only be done upon such evidence of criminality as, according to the laws of
the place where the fugitive or person so charged shall be found, would justify his apprehension and commitment for trial, if the crime or offence had there been committed; and the respective judges and other magistrates of the two governments shall have power, jurisdiction, and authority, upon complaint made under oath, to issue a warrant for the apprehension of the fugitive or person so charged, that he may be brought before such judges or other

A PROCLAMATION.

July 4, 1857.

Whe rea s a convention between the United States and the Republic of Peru with regard to the interpretation to be given to article XHth of the treaty of the twenty-sixth July, eighteen hundred and fifty-one, was signed at Lima on the fourth of July, eighteen hundred and fifty-seven, which convention is, word for word, as follows :

Preamble.

Certain doubts having arisen with
regard to the interpretation to be given to article twelfth of the treaty of the 26th of July, 1851, as to the goods, other than oil and the produce of their fishery, that the whale ships of the United States may land and sell, or barter, duty free, for the purpose of obtaining provisions and refitting, a concession which, in articles eighty-one and one hundred and ten of the General Commercial Regulations, is not so extensive; and it being convenient, for the advantage of the citizens of the United States employed in the whale fishery, and of the citizens of Peru, who furnish provisions, to fix, clearly and definitively, the proper meaning of the concessions stipulated in the abovementioned article twelfth of the treaty of the 26th July, 1851, so that while
those reciprocal benefits are secured, all and every controversy in the matter may be avoided:
The envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the United
States of America to the Republic of Peru, John Randolph Clay, in virtue of his full powers, and his excellency Doctor Don Manuel Ortiz de Zevallos, minister of foreign affairs of the Republic of Peru, fully authorized to act in the premises by the excellent council of ministers charged with the government of the Republic, after having held repeated conferences, and come to a mutual

de derechos, con el objeto de procurarse víveres y repararse; permiso que en los artículos 81 y 110 del Reglamento General de Comercio no tiene la misma latitud ; y siendo conveniente en provecho del comercio de los naturales Peruanos que proveen de víveres, y en utilidad de los ciudadanos de los Estados Unidos que se dedican a la pesca, fijar clara y definitivamente el sentido propio de las concesiones estipuladas en el preindicado articulo 12 del tratado de 26 de Julio, de 1851, de manera que, á la vez que se alcancen aquellas reciprocas ventajas, se eviten

provides:

as military bounty land-warrants, and be subject to the same rules and regulations.
Arti cle X. Samuel Allis has long been the firm friend of the Pawnees, and in years gone by has ministered to their wants and necessities.

ment of the amount of the accounts between the postal departments of

To all the other countries above named, the postage beyond the United States must be computed as follows, viz. one rate for the first half-ounce or under ; two rates if the weight is over one half and not exceeding an ounce ; four rates if over one ounce and not exceeding two ounces ; and so on, charging two rates for every ounce or fractional part of an ounce over the first ounce. In adding the United States and French postage on letters to these last-named countries, the United States proportion of inland postage (three cents the single rate) must be excluded, as this is included in the rates set down as the postage from the United States.
