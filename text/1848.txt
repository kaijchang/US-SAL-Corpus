Chap . CL. -- An Act to carry into Effect certain Provisions in the Treaties between
the United States and China and the Ottoman Porte, giving certain judicial powers to Ministers and Consuls of the United States in those Countries.

The commissioner and consuls of the United States appointed to reside in China vested with judicial authority.
May arraign and try all citizens of the United States charged with offences against law in the dominions of China, and upon conviction, sentence the offenders.
1850, ch. 65.
Their jurisdiction in regard to civil rights.
Laws of the United States extended over the citizens of the United States in China; and when theyare deficient, the common law extended in like manner.
Where these are insufficient, the commissioner shall, by decrees and regulations, supply such defects.
The commissioner, with the advice of the several consuls, to make the necessary regulations, decrees, &c., for carrying the provisions of this act into effect.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That, to carry into full effect the provisions of the treaty of July third, eighteen hundred and forty-four, with the Chinese empire, the commissioner and the
consuls of the United States, duly appointed to reside in China, shall, in addition to the other powers and duties imposed upon them by the provisions of said treaty, be vested with the judicial authority herein described, which shall appertain to the said office of commissioner and consul, and be a part of the duties belonging thereto.
Sec . 2. And be it further enacted, That in regard to crimes and misdemeanors, the said public functionaries are hereby fully empowered to arraign, and try, in the manner herein provided, all citizens of the United States charged with offences against law, which shall be committed in the dominions of China, including Macao, and, upon conviction, to sentence such offenders in the manner herein authorized ; and the said functionaries and each of them are hereby authorized to issue all such processes as are suitable and necessary to carry this authority into execution.
Sec . 3. And be it further enacted, That in regard to civil rights, whether of property or person, the said functionaries are hereby vested with all the judicial authority necessary to execute the provisions of said treaty, and shall entertain jurisdiction in matters of contract at the port where, or nearest to which, the contract was made, or at the port at which, or nearest to which, it was to be executed; and in all other matters at the port where, or nearest to which, the cause of controversy arose, or at the port where, or nearest to which, the damage complained of was sustained-- any such port above named being always one of the five mentioned in the treaty ; which jurisdiction shall embrace all controversies between citizens of the United States or others provided for by said treaty.
Sec . 4. And be it further enacted, That such jurisdiction in criminal and civil matters shall, in all cases, be exercised and enforced in conformity with the laws of the United States, which are hereby, so far as is necessary to execute said treaty, extended over all citizens of the United States in China, (and over all others to the extent that the terms of the treaty justify or require,) so far as such laws are suitable to carry said treaty into effect; but in all cases where such laws are not adapted to the object, or are deficient in the provisions necessary to furnish suitable remedies, the common law shall be extended in like manner over such citizens and others in China; and if defects still remain to be supplied, and neither the common law nor the statutes of the United States furnish appropriate and suitable remedies, the commissioner shall, by decrees and regulations which shall have the force of law, supply such defects and deficiencies.
Sec . 5. And be it further enacted, That, in order to organize and carry into effect the system of jurisprudence demanded by said treaty, the commissioner, with the advice of the several consuls for the five ports named in said treaty, or so many of them as can be conveniently assembled, shall prescribe the forms of all processes which shall be issued by any of said consuls; the mode of executing and the time of returning the same; the manner in which trials shall be conducted, and how the records thereof shall be kept; the form of oaths for Christian witnesses, and the mode of examining all other witnesses; the costs which shall be allowed to the prevailing party, and the fees

party who appeals from the decision of a consul; and generally, without further enumeration, to make all such decrees and regulations from time to time, under the provisions of this act, as the exigency may demand ; and all such regulations, decrees, and orders shall be plainly drawn up in writing, and submitted, as above provided, for the advice of the consuls, or as many of them as can be consulted without prejudicial delay or inconvenience, who shall each signify his assent or dissent in writing, with his name subscribed thereto; and after taking such advice, and considering the same, the commissioner may, nevertheless, by causing the decree, order, or regulation, to be published with his signature thereto, and the opinions of his advisers inscribed thereon, [make it] to become binding and obligatory until annulled or modified by Congress, and it shall take effect from the publication or any subsequent day thereto named in the act.
Sec . 6. And be it further enacted, That all such regulations, orders, and decrees shall, as speedily as may be after publication, be transmitted by the commissioner, with the opinions of his advisers, as drawn up by them severally, to the President, to be laid before Congress for revision.
Sec . 7.

Sec . 8. And be it further enacted, That any consul, when sitting alone for the trial of offences, shall finally decide all cases where the fine imposed does not exceed one hundred dollars, or the term of imprisonment does not exceed sixty days, and there shall be no appeal therefrom, except as provided in section eleven of this act.
Sec . 9. And be it further enacted, That when sitting alone he may also decide all cases in which the fine imposed does not exceed five hundred dollars, or the term of imprisonment does not exceed ninety days; but in all such cases, if the fine exceeds one hundred dollars, or the imprisonment exceeds ninety days, the defendant may, by comply-
ing with the requirements in cases of appeal, carry the case before the commissioner by appeal.
Sec . 10. And be it further enacted, That whenever in any case the consul shall be of opinion that, by reason of the legal questions which may arise therein, assistance will be useful to him, or whenever he shall be of opinion that a severer punishment than those above specified will be required, he shall, in either case, summon one or more citizens of the United States, not exceeding four in number, but in capital cases not less than four, who shall be persons of good repute and competent to the duty, to sit with him in the trial, and who, after so sitting upon the trial, shall each enter upon the record his judgment and opinion, and sign the same.

also approves of the conviction; but it shall always be lawful to convict

Sec . 17. And be it further enacted, That it shall be the duty of the commissioner to establish a tariff of fees for judicial services, which shall be paid by such parties, and to such persons, as said commis-

TREATY WITH THE STOCKBRIDGE INDIANS. Nov. 24, 1848. 955

TREATY WITH THE STOCKBRIDGE TRIBE OF INDIANS.

Wher eas , by an act of Congress, entitled "An Act for the relief of the Stockbridge tribe of Indians, in the Territory of Wisconsin," approved on the third day of March, A. D., 1843, it was provided that
the township of land on the east side of Winnebago Lake, secured to said tribe by the treaty with the Menomonee Indians of February 8th, 1831, as amended by the Senate of the United States, and not heretofore ceded by said tribe to the United States, should be divided and allotted among
the individual members of said tribe, by commissioners to be elected for that purpose, who were to make report of such division and allotment, and thereupon the persons composing said tribe were to become citizens of the United States.
And whereas a portion of said tribe refused to recognize the validity of said act of Congress, or the proceedings which were had under it,
or to be governed by its provisions, and upon their petition a subsequent act was passed by the Congress of the United States, on the 6th day of August, 1846, repealing the said act of March 3d, 1843, and providing, among other things, that such of said tribe as should enrol themselves with the sub-agent of Indian affairs at Green Bay, should be and remain citizens of the United States, and the residue of said tribe were restored to their ancient form of government as an Indian tribe. It was also provided that the said township of land should be divided into two districts, one of which was to be known as the " Indian district," the other as the "citizen district;" the former to be held in common by the party who did not desire citizenship, and the latter to be divided and allotted among such as were citizens and desired to remain so.
And whereas it has been found impracticable to carry into full effect the provisions of the act of August 6th, 1846, by dividing the said township of land in the manner specified in said act, without infringing upon private rights acquired in good faith under the act of 1843 hereinbefore referred to, with a view of relieving both the Indian and citizen parties of said Stockbridge tribe of Indians from their present embarrassments, and to secure to each their just rights, articles of agreement and compromise have been entered into, as follows: --

los limites que porel siguiente articulo van a fijarse alos Estados
Unidos, el gobierno de los mismos Estados Unidos exigira su libertad y los hara restituir a su pais.

Arti cle V.

Boundary line between the two republics established.

The boundary line between the two republics shall commence in the Gulf of Mexico, three leagues
from land, opposite the mouth of the Rio Grande, otherwise called Rio Bravo del Norte, or opposite the mouth of its deepest branch, if
it should have more than one
branch emptying directly into the sea; from thence up the middle of that river, following the deepest channel, where it has more than
one, to the point where it strikes the southern boundary of New
Mexico; thence, westwardly, along the whole southern boundary of New Mexico (which runs north
of the town called Paso) to its western termination; thence, northward, along the western line of New Mexico, until it intersects the first branch of the River Gila ;
(or if it should not intersect any branch of that river, then to the
point on the said line nearest to such branch, and thence in a di-
rect line to the same;) thence down the middle of the said branch
and of the said river, until it empties into the Rio Colorado ; thence
across the Rio Colorado, following the division line between Upper
and Lower California, to the Pacific Ocean.

Southern and western limits of New Mexico, as
referred to in this article, defined.

The southern and western limits of New Mexico, mentioned in this article, are th^e laid down in the map entitled " Map of the
United Mexican States, as organ-
ized and defined by various acts
of the Congress of said republic,
and constructed according to the
best authorities. Revised edition.
Published at New York, in 1847, by J. Disturnell." Of which map a copy is added to this treaty, bearing the signatures and seals of the undersigned plenipotentiaries.

Arti cul o V.
La linea divisoria entre las dos republicas comenzara en el Golfo de Mexico, tres leguas fuera de tierra frente a la desembocadura del Rio Grande, llamado por otro nombre Rio Bravo del Norte, 6 del mas profundo de sus brazos, si en la desembocadura tuviere varios brazos: correra por mitad de dicho rio, siguiendo el canal mas profundo, donde tenga mas de un canal, hasta el punto en que dicho rio corta el lindero meridional de Nuevo Mexico; continuara luego hacia occidente por todo -este lindero meridional (que corre al norte del pueblo llamado Paso) hasta su termino por el lado de occidente : desde alii subira la linea divisoria hacia el norte por el lindero occidental de Nuevo Mexico, hasta donde este lindero este cortado por el primer brazo del Rio Gila; (y si no esta cortado por ningun brazo del Rio Gila, entonces hasta el punto del mismo lindero occidental mas cercano al tai brazo, y.de alii en una linea recta al mismo brazo;) continuara despues por mitad de este brazo y del Rio Gila hasta su confluencia con el Rio Colorado; y desde la confluencia de ambos rios la linea divisoria, cortando el Colorado, seguira el limite que separa la Alta de la Baja California hasta el Mar Pacifico.
Los linderos meridional y occidental de Nuevo Mexico, de que habla este articulo, son los que se marcan en la carta titulada : Mapa

927

And, in order to preclude all difficulty in tracing upon the ground the limit separating Upper from Lower California, it is agreed that the said limit shall consist of a straight line drawn from the middle of the Rio Gila, where it unites with the Colorado, to a point on the coast of the Pacific Ocean distant one marine league due south of the southernmost point of the port of San Diego, according to the plan of said port made in the year 1782 by Don Juan Pantoja, second sailing-master of the Spanish fleet, and published at Madrid in the year 1802, in the Atlas to the voyage of the schooners Sutil and Mexicana, of which plan a copy is hereunto added, signed and sealed by the respective plenipotentiaries.
In order to designate the boundary line with due precision, upon authoritative maps, and to establish upon the ground landmarks which shall show the limits of both republics, as described in the present article, the two governments shall each appoint a commissioner and a surveyor, who, before the expiration of one year from the date of the exchange of ratifications of this treaty, shall meet at the port of San Diego, and proceed to run and mark the said boundary in its whole course to the mouth of the Rio Bravo del Norte. They shall keep journals and make out plans of their operations ; and the result agreed upon by them shall be deemed a part of this treaty, and shall have the same force as if it were inserted therein. The two governments will amicably agree regarding what may be necessary to these persons, and also as to their respective escorts, should such be necessary.
The boundary line established by this article shall be religiously respected by each of the two republics, and no change shall ever be made therein, except by the express and free consent of both nations, lawfully given by the general government of each, in con-

limite que separa la Alta de la Baja California, queda convenido
que dicho limite consistira en una linea recta tirada desde la mitad
del Rio Gila en el punto donde se une con el Colorado, hasta un punto en la costa del Mar Pacifico,
distante una legua marina al sur del punto mas meridional del puerto de San Diego, segun este puerto esta dibujado en el piano que le-
vanto el ano de 1782 el segundo piloto de la armada Espanola Don Juan Pantoja, y se publico en Madrid el de 1802, en el Atlas para el viage de las goletas Sutil y Mexi
cana ; del cual piano se agrega copia firmada y sellada por los plenipotenciarios respectivos.

Para consiguar la linea divisoria con la precision debida en mapas fehacientes, y para establecer sobre la tierra mojones que pongan a la vista los liinites de ambas repu-
blicas, segun quedan descmtos en el presente articulo, nombrara cada
uno de los dos gobiernos un comisario y un agrimensor, que se juntaran antes del termino de un ano contado desde la fecha del cange de las ratificaciones de este tratado, en el puerto de San Diego, y procederan a senalar y demarcar
la expresada linea divisoria en todo su curso hasta la desembocadura
del Rio Bravo del Norte. Lievaran di arios y llevantaran pianos de sus operaciones: y el resultado convenido por ellos se tendra por
parte de este tratado, y tendra la misma fuerza que si estuviese inserto en el; debiendo convenir
amistosamente los dos gobiernos en el arreglo de cuanto necesiten estos individuosffy en la escolta
respectiva que deban llevar, siem-
pre que se crea necesario.
La linea divisoria que se establece poreste articulo sera religio-
samente respetada por cada una de las dos republicas, y ninguna variacion se hara jamas en ella, sino

in the preceding article ; it being understood that this passage is to be by navigating the Gulf of Cali-
fornia and the River Colorado, and not by land, without the express consent of the Mexican
government. If, by the examinations which
may be made, it should be ascertained to be practicable and advantageous to construct a road, canal, or railway, which should in
whole or in part run upon the River Gila, or upon its right or its left-bank, within the space of one marine league from either margin of the river, the govern-
ments of both republics will form an agreement regarding its construction, in order that it may
serve equally for the use and advantage of both countries.

Article XI.

Incursions of savage tribes into the territory of Mexico to be restrained by the government of the United States
or punished.

Considering that a great part of the territories which, by the present treaty, are to be compre-
hended for the future within the limits of the United States, is now occupied by savage tribes, who
will hereafter be under the exclusive control of the government of the United States, and whose in-
cursions within the territory of Mexico would be prejudicial in the extreme, it is solemnly agreed that all such incursions shall be forcibly restrained by the government of the United States whensoever this may be necessary; and that when they cannot be prevented, they shall be punished by the said government, and satisfaction for the same shall be exacted --
all in the same way, and with equal diligence and energy, as if
the same incursions were medi-

zens. It shall not be lawful, under
any pretext whatever, for any in-
habitant of the United States to purchase or acquire any Mexican, or any foreigner residing in Mex-
ico, who may have been captured by Indians inhabiting the territory of either of the two republics, nor to purchase or acquire horses,
mules, cattle, or property of any kind, stolen within Mexican territory by such Indians.
And in the event of any person or persons, captured within Mexican territory by Indians, being
carried into the territory of the United States, the government of the latter engages and binds itself,
in the most solemn manner, so soon as it shall know of such captives being within its territory, and shall be able so to do, through
the faithful exercise of its influence
and power, to rescue them and return them to their country, or
deliver them to the agent or representative of the Mexican govern-
ment. The Mexican authorities will, as far as practicable, give to the government of the United States notice of such captures; and its agent shall pay the ex-
penses incurred in the maintenance and transmission of the rescued
captives ; who, in the mean time, shall be treated with the utmost hospitality by the American au-
thorities at the place where they may be. But if the government
of the United States, before receiving such notice from Mexico,
should obtain intelligence, through any other channel, of the existence of Mexican captives within its
territory, it will proceed forthwith
to effect their release and delivery
to the Mexican agent, as above stipulated.
For the purpose of giving to these stipulations the fullest possible efficacy, thereby affording the security and redress demanded by their true spirit and intent, the government of the United
States will now and hereafter pass, without unnecessary delay,
and always vigilantly enforce, such

Inhabitants of the United States not to purchase any Mexicans, &c., captured by Indians, nor to
purchase horses, mules, &c., stolen by them within Mexican terri-

Y en caso de que cualquier persona 6 personas cautivadas por los Indios dentro del territorio Mexicano sean llevadas al territorio de los Estados Unidos, el gobierno de dichos Estados Unidos se compromete y liga de la manera mas solemne, en cuanto le sea posible, a rescatarlas, y a restituirlas a su pais, 6 entregarlas al agente 6 representante del gobierno Mexicano; haciendo todo esto, tan luego como sepa que los dichos cautivos se hallan dentro de su territorio, y empleando al efecto el leal ejercicio de su influencia y poder. Las autoridades Mexicanas daran a las de los Estados Unidos, segun sea practicable, una noticia de tales cautivos; y el agente Mexicano pagara los gastos erogados en el mantenimiento y remision de los que se rescaten,
los cuales entre tanto seran tratados con la mayor hospitalidad por las autoridades Americanas del
lugar en que se encuentren. Mas si el gobierno de los Estados Unidos antes de recibir aviso de Mexi-
co, tuviere noticia por cualquiera otro conducto de existir en su territorio cautivos Mexicanos, procedera desde luego a verificar su

never be lost sight of by the said government when providing for the removal of the Indians from any portion of the said territories, or for its being settled by citizens

In case of disagreement between the governments of the two countries, mutual representations and pacific negotiations to be used to settle such differences.

If unhappily any disagreement should hereafter arise between the governments of the two republics, whether with respect to the inter-

The merchants of either republic then residing in the other shall be allowed to remain twelve months, (for those dwelling in the interior,) and six months (for those dwelling at the seaports,) to collect their debts and settle their affairs; during which periods, they shall enjoy the same protection, and be on the same footing, in all respects, as the citizens or subjects of the most friendly nations ; and, at the expiration thereof, or at any time before, they shall have full liberty to depart, carrying off all their effects without molestation or hinderance, conforming therein to the same laws which the citizens or subjects of the most friendly nations are required to conform to. Upon the entrance of the armies of either nation into the territories of the other, women and children, ecclesi astics, scholars of every faculty, cultivators of the earth, merchants, artisans, manufacturers, and fishermen, unarmed and inhabiting unfortified towns, villages, or places, and in general all persons whose occupations are for the

Articu lo XXII.

Si (lo que no es de esperarse, y Dios no permita) desgraciadamente
se suscitare guerra entre las dos republicas, estas para el caso de
tai calamidad se comprometen
ahora solemnemente, ante si mismas y ante el mundo, a observar
las reglas siguientes de una manera absoluta si la naturaleza del objeto a que se contraen lo permite; y tan extrictamente como sea dable
en todos los casos en que la abso-
luta observancia de ellas fuere imposible: --
1. Los coraerciantes de cada
una de las dos republicas que a la
sazon residan en territorio de la otra, podran permanecer doce meses los que residan en el interior, y seis meses los que residan
en los puertos, para recoger sus deudas y arreglar sus negocios;
durante estos plazos disputaran la misma proteccion y estaran sobre el mismo pie en todos respectos que los ciudadanos 6 subditos de
las naciones mas amigas; y al expirar el termino, 6 antes de el, tendran completa libertad para
salir y llevar todos sus efectos sin

leyes a que esten sujetos, y deban
arreglarse los ciudadanos 6 subditos de las naciones mas amigas.
Cuando los ejercitos de una de las dos naciones entren en territories de la otra, las mujeres y ninos, los

common subsistence and benefit of mankind, shall be allowed to
continue their respective employments unmolested in their persons.
Nor shall their houses or goods be burnt or otherwise destroyed, nor
their cattle taken, nor their fields wasted, by the armed force into whose power, by the events of war,
they may happen to fall; but if the necessity arise to take any thing from them for the use of such armed force, the same shall be paid for at an equitable price. All churches, hospitals, schools,
colleges, libraries, and other establishments for charitable and
beneficent purposes, shall be respected, and all persons connected with the same protected in the dis-
charge of their duties, and the
pursuit of their vocations.

Prisoners of
war; their treatment.

2. In order that the fate of prisoners of war may be alleviated, all such practices as those of sending them into distant inclement or unwholesome districts, or crowding them into close and noxious places, shall be studiously
avoided. They shall not be confined in dungeons, prison-ships, or
prisons; nor be put in irons, or bound, or otherwise restrained in the use of their limbs. The officers shall enjoy liberty on their paroles, within convenient districts, and have comfortable quarters; and the common soldier shall be disposed in cantonments, open and extensive enough for air and exercise, and lodged in barracks as roomy and good as are provided
by the party in whose power they are for its own troops. But if any officer shall break his parole by leaving the district so assigned him, or any other prisoner shall
escape from the limits of his cantonment, after they shall have been designated to him, such individual, officer, or other prisoner,
shall forfeit so much of the benefit of this article as provides for
his liberty on parole or in cantonment. And if any officer so
breaking his parole, or any common soldier so escaping from the

sonas sean molestadas. No seran incendiadas sus casas 6 bienes, 6
destruidos de otra manera; ni seran tornados sus ganados, ni devastados sus campos por la fuerza armada en cuyo poder puedan venir a care por los acontecimientos de la guerra; pero si hubiere necesidad de tomarlos alguna cosa para el uso de la misma fuerza armada, se les pagara lo tornado a un precio justo. Todas
las iglesias, hospitales, escuelas, colegios, librerias, y demas establecimientos de caridad y benefi-
cencia seran respetados ; y todas las personas que dependan de los mismos seran protegidas en el de sempeno de sus deberes y en la
continuacion de sus profesiones. 2. Para aliviar la suerte de los
prisioneros de guerra se evitaran ciudadosamente, las practicas de enviarlos a distritos distantes, inclementes 6 malsanos, 6 de aglo-
merarlos en lugares estrechos y enfirmizos. No se confinaran en calabosos, prisiones ni pontones;
no se les aherrojar , ni se les atara, ni se les impedira de ningun otro
modo el uso desus miembros. Los oficiales que daran en libertad
bajo su palabra de honor, dentro de distritos convenientes y tendran alojamientos comodos; y los sol-
dados rasos se colocaran en acantonamientos bastante despejados y
extensos para la ventilacion y el ejercicio, y se alojaran en cuarteles tan amplios y comodos como los que use para sus propias tropas la
parte que los tenga en su poder. Pero si algun oficial faltare a su palabra, saliendo del distrito que se le ha senalado; 6 algun otro prisionero se fugare de los limites
de su acantonamiento despues que estos se les hayan fijado, tai oficial 6 prisionero perdera el beneficio
del presente articulo por lo que mira a su libertad bajo su palabra 6 en acantonamiento; y si algun

limits assigned him, shall afterwards be found in arms, previously to his being regularly exchanged, the person so offending shall be dealt with according to the established laws of war. The officers shall be daily furnished by the party in whose power they are, with as many rations, and of the same articles, as are allowed, either in kind or by commutation, to officers of equal rank in its own army; and all others shall be daily furnished with such ration as is allowed to a common soldier in its own service: the value of all which supplies shall, at the close of the war, or at periods to be agreed upon between the respective commanders, be paid by the other party, on a mutual adjustment of accounts for the subsistence of prisoners ; and such accounts shall not be mingled with or set off against any others, nor the balance due on them be withheld, as a compensation or reprisal for any cause whatever, real or pretended. Each party shall be allowed to keep a commissary of prisoners, appointed by itself, with every can tonment of prisoners, in possession of the other; which commissary shall see the prisoners as often as he pleases ; shall be allowed to receive, exempt from all duties or taxes, and to distribute, whatever comforts may be sent to them by their friends; and shall be free to transmit his reports in open letters to the party by whom he is employed.
And it is declared that neither the pretence that war dissolves all treaties, nor any other whatever, shall be considered as annulling or suspending the solemn covenant contained in this article. On the contrary, the state of war is precisely that for which it is provided ; and during which, its stipulations are to be as sacredly observed as the most acknowledged obligations under the law of nature or nations.

debidamente cangeado, tai persona en esta actitud ofensiva sera trata-
da conforme a las leyes comunes de la guerra. A los oficiales se
proveera diariamente por la parte en cuyo poder esten, de tantas raciones compuestas de los mismos articulos como las que gozan en
especie 6 en equivalente los oficiales de la misma graduacion en su propio ejercito: a. todos los demas prisioneros se proveera dia
riamente de una racion semejante a la que se ministra al soldado raso
en su propio servicio : el valor de todas estas suministraciones se pagara por la otra parte al concluirse la guerra, 6 en los periodos que se convengan entre sus respec-
tivos comandantes, precediendo una mutua liquidacion de las cuentas que se lleven del mantenimiento de prisioneros: y tales cuentas no se mezclaran ni compen-
saran con otras; ni el -saldo que resulte de ellas, se reusara bajo
pretesto de compensacion 6 represalia por cualquiera causa, real figurada. Cada una de las partes podra mantener un comisario de prisioneros nombrado por ella mis
ma en cada acantonamiento de los prisioneros que esten en poder de la otra parte: este comisario visitara a los prisioneros siempre
que quiera; tendra facultad de recibir, libres de todo derecho 6 impuesto, y de distribuir todos los
auxilios que pueden enviarles sus
amigos, y podra libremente transmitir sus partes en cartas abiertas
a la autoridad por la cual esta empleado.
Y se declara que ni el pretesto
de que la guerra destruye los tratados, ni otro alguno, sea el que fuere, se considerara que anula
suspende el pacto solemne contenido en este articulo. Por el
contrario, el estado de guerra es cabalmente el que se ha tenido
presente al ajustarlo, y durante el cual sus estipulaciones se han de observar tan santamente como las obligaciones mas reconocidas de
la ley natural 6 de gentes.

The solemn covenant herein entered into not to be annulled on the pretence that war dissolves all treaties.
