July twenty-seventh, eighteen hundred and seventy-one, of amounts paid

to second assistant and other surgeons, for services rendered in con-

nection with raising and organizing volunteers within the State during the

rebellion, are not admissible under the law, for the reason that the employ-

ment of the said medical officers was not authorized prior to the act of

July second, eighteen hundred and sixto-two ; and whereas it appears that

the said State, and were subsequently mustered or employed in the service

of the United States : Therefore,

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United

States of America in Congress assembled, That the Secretary of the Treas-

ury be, and he is hereby, directed, out of any money appropriated to

continue the settlement of accounts presented under the act of July

twenty-seventh, eighteen hundred and sixty-one, to pay to the governor

of Connecticut, or to his duly authorized agents, any amounts advanced

by the said State, in payment of extra surgeons or assistant surgeons for

services rendered prior to their muster into the service of the United

States ; the said claims to be settled upon proper vouchers to be filed and

passed upon by the proper accounting officers of the treasury.

Sec . 2. That where the vouchers of other States, for payments made

to extra surgeons or assistant surgeons of militia or volunteers accepted

into the service of the United States, are situated similarly with those of

Connecticut, the Treasury Department adjust and settle them according

to the provisions of the foregoing section.

If the assessor is satisfied that the distiller has reported all the spirits produced by him, and the quantity so reported shall be found to be less than eighty per centum of the producing capacity of the distillery as estimated under the provisions of this act, an assessment shall be made for such deficiency at the rate of seventy cents for every proof gallon. In determining the quantity of grain used, fifty-six pounds shall be accounted as a bushel; and if the assessor finds that the distiller has used any grain or molasses in excess of the capacity of his distillery as estimated under the provisions of this act, an assessment shall be made against the distiller at the rate of seventy cents for every proof gallon of spirits that should have been produced from the grain or molasses so used in excess, which assessment shall be made whether the quantity of spirits reported is equal to or exceeds eighty per centum of the producing capacity of the distillery. If the assessor finds that the distiller has not accounted for all the spirits produced by him, he shall, from all the evidence he can obtain, determine what quantity of spirits was actually produced by such distiller, and an assessment shall be made for the difference between the quantity reported and the quantity shown to have been actually produced, at the rate of seventy cents for every proof gallon: Provided, That the actual product shall be assumed to be in no case less than eighty per centum of the producing capacity of the distillery as estimated under the provisions of this act, or under the act to which this is an amendment. Any and all assessments made under this section shall be a lien on all distilled spirits on the distillery premises, the distillery used for distilling the same, the stills, vessels, fixtures, and tools therein, and on the tract of land whereon the said distillery is located, together with any building thereon, from the time such assessment is made until the same shall have been paid."

such spirits when the manufacture thereof is complete. Sec . 14. That on and after the date when this act shall take effect, the

Preamble Discriminating duties on merchandise imported in Japanese vessels, to be discontinued so long as, &c. 1828, ch. Ill,  1. Vol iv. p. 308.

Whereas satisfactory information has been received by me from His Majesty the Emperor of Japan, through an official communication of Mr. Arinori Mori, His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires, under date of the second instant, that no other or higher duties of tonnage or impost are imposed or levied in the ports of the Empire of Japan, upon vessels wholly belonging to citizens of the United States, or upon the produce, manufactures, or merchandise imported in the same from the United States, or from any foreign country, than are levied on Japanese ships and their cargoes in the same ports under like circumstances :
Now, therefore, I, Ulysses S. Gran t , President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by an act of Congress of the twenty-fourth day of May, one thousand eight hundred and twenty-eight, do hereby declare and proclaim that from and after the said second instant, so long as vessels of the United States and their cargoes shall be exempt from discriminating duties as aforesaid, any such duties on Japanese vessels entering the ports of the United States, or on the produce, manufactures, or merchandise imported in such vessels, shall be discontinued and abolished.

No. 13. BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: Oct. 11, 1872.

A PROCLAMATION-

Where as the revolution of another year has again brought the time when it is usual to look back upon the past, and publicly to thank the Almighty for his mercies and his blessings ;
And whereas if any one people has more occasion than another for such thankfulness, it is the citizens of the United States, whose government is their creature, subject to their behests; who have reserved to themselves ample civil and religious freedom and equality before the law; who, during the last twelvemonth, have enjoyed exemption from any grievous or general calamity, and to whom prosperity in agriculture, manufactures, and commerce has been vouchsafed:
Now, therefore, by these considerations, I recommend that on Thursday, the twenty-eighth day of N ovember next, the people meet in their respective places of worship, and there make their acknowledgments to God for his kindness and bounty.
In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
Done at the city of Washington, this eleventh day of October, in the year of j- -| our Lord one thousand eight hundred and seventy-two, and of the [seal .j jndepcndence of the United States the ninety-seventh.

By the President: Ham il ton Fish , Secretary of State.

Wherea s , upon information received by me from His Majesty the Emperor of the French, that discriminating duties before the date of said information levied in French ports upon merchandise imported from the countries of its origin in vessels of the United States were discontinued and abolished, and in pursuance of the provisions of an act of Congress of the 7th of January, 18'24, and of an act in addition thereto of the 24th of May, 1828, I did, on the 12th day of June, 1869, issue my proclamation declaring that the discriminating duties before that date levied upon merchandise imported from the countries of its origin into ports of the United States in French vessels were thereby discontinued and abolished;
And whereas, upon information subsequently received by me that the levying of such duties on all merchandise imported into France in vessels of the United States, whether from the country of its origin or from other countries, had been discontinued, I did, on the 20th of November, 1869, in pursuance of the provisions of the said acts of Congress, and by the authority in me vested thereby, issue my proclamation declaring that the discriminating duties before that date levied upon merchandise imported into the United States in French vessels, either from the countries of its origin or from any other country, were thereby discontinued and abolished;
And whereas, by the provisions of the said acts of Congress of January 7th, 1824, and of the 24th of May, 1828, as well as by the terms of the said proclamations of the 12th of June, 1869, and of the 20th of November, 1869, the said suspension of discriminating duties upon merchandise imported into the United States in French vessels was granted by the United States on condition that, and to continue so long as merchandise imported into France in vessels of the United States should be admitted into the ports of France on the same terms of exemption from the payment of such discriminating duties ;
