"SEC. 319. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary shall, within thirty days following the enactment of this section, proclaim national marketing quotas for burley tobacco for the three marketing years beginning October 1, 1971, and determine and announce the amount of the marketing quota for burley tobacco for the marketing year beginning October 1,1971, as provided in this section.
"Within thirty days following such proclamation, the Secretary shall conduct a referendum of the farmers engaged in the production of the 1970 crop of burley tobacco to determine whether they favor or oppose the establishment of farm marketing quotas on a poundage basis as provided in this section for the three marketing years beginning October 1,1971. If the Secretary determines that two-thirds or more of the farmers voting in such referendum approve marketing quotas on a poundage basis, marketing quotas as provided in this section shall be in effect for those three marketing years. I f marketing quotas on a poundage basis are not approved by at least two-thirds of the farmers voting in such referendum, no marketing quotas or price support for burley tobacco shall be in effect for the marketing year beginning October 1, 1971.

If marketing quotas have been made effective on a poundage basis under this section, the Secretary sliall, not later than February 1 of the last year of three consecutive marketiiig years for which marketing quotas are in effect under this section, proclaim national marketing quotas for burley tobacco for the next three succeeding marketing years as provided in this section. Within thirty days following such proclamation, the Secretary shall conduct a referendum in accordance with section 312(c) of the Act. If the Secretary determines that more than one-third of the farmers voting oppose the national marketing quotas, he shall announce the results and no marketing quotas or price support shall be in effect for such kind of tobacco for the first marketing year of such three-year period. Thereafter, the provisions of section 312 of the Act shall apply: Pro'vided^ That the national marketing quota and farm marketing quotas shall be determined as provided in this section. Notice of thei farm marketing quota which will be in effect for his farm for the first marketing year covered by any referendum under this section shall, insofar as practicable, be mailed to the farm operator in sufficient time to be received prior to the referendum.
" (c) The national marketing quota determined under this section for burley tobacco for any marketing year shall be the amount produced in the United States which the Secretary estimates will be utilized in the United States and will be exported during such marketing year, adjusted upward or downward in such amount as the Secretary, in his discretion, determines is desirable for the purpose of maintaining an adequate supply or for effecting an orderly reduction of supplies to the reserve supply level. Any such downward adjustment shall not exceed 5 per centum of such estimated utilization and exports. For each marketing year for which marketing quotas are in effect under this section, the Secretary in his discretion may establish a reserve (hereinafter referred to as the 'national reserve') from the national marketing quota in an amount not in excess of 1 per centum of the national marketing quota to be available for making corrections and adjusting inequities in farm marketing quotas, and for establishing marketing quotas for new farms (that is, farms for which farm marketing quotas are not otherwise established).
" ( d ) When a national marketing quota is first proclaimed under this section, the Secretary shall through local committees determine a farm yield for each farm for which a burley tobacco acreage allotment was established for the marketing year beginning October 1, 1970. Such yield shall be determined by averaging the yield per acre for the four highest years of the five consecutive years beginning with the 1966 crop year: Provided^ That if burley tobacco was produced on the farm in fewer than five of such years, the farm yield shall be the simple average of the yields obtained in the years during such period that burley tobacco was produced on the farm: Provided further^ That if no burley tobacco was produced on the farm but the farm was considered as having planted burley tobacco during the immediately preceding five years, the farm yield will be appraised on the basis of the yields established for similar farms in the area on which burley tobacco was produced during such five-year period : And provided furtJier, That the farm yield established for any farm shall not exceed three thousand five hundred pounds per acre.
"(e) A preliminary farm marketing quota Shall be determined for each farm for which a burley tobacco acreage allotment was established for the marketing year beginning October 1, 1970, by multiplying the farm yield determined under subsection (d) of this section by the farm

acreage allotment (prior to any reduction for violation of regulations issued pursuant to the Act) established for such farm for the marketing year beginning October 1, 1970. For each farm for which such a preliminary farm marketing quota is determined, a farm marketing quota for the first j^ear shall be determined by multiplying the preliminary farm marketing quota by a national factor obtained by dividing the national marketing quota determined under subsection (c) of this section (less the national reserve) by the sum of all preliminary farm marketing quotas as determined under this subsection: Provided^ That such national factor shall not be less than 95 per centum.
"The farm marketing quota for each succeeding year shall be determined by multiplying the previous year's farm marketing quota by a national factor obtained by dividing the national marketing quota determined under subsection (c) of this section (less the national reserve) by the sum of the farm marketing quotas for the immediately preceding year for all farms for which burley tobacco marketing quotas will be determined for such succeeding marketing year: Provided^ That such national factor shall not be less than 95 per centum: Provided fwrther^ That for the marketing years beginning October 1, 1972, and October 1, 1973, the farm marketing quota for any farm shall not be less than the smaller of (1) one-half acre times the farm yield times one-half the sum of the figure one and the national factor for the current year, or (2) the farm marketing quota for the immediately preceding marketing year times one-half the sum of the figure one and the national factor for the current year. The farm marketing quota so computed for any farm for any year shall be increased by the number of pounds by which marketings from the farm during the immediately preceding year were less than the farm marketing quota (after adjustments) : Provided^ That any such increase shall not exceed the amount of the farm marketing quota (including leased pounds) for the immediately preceding marketing year prior to any increase for undermarketings or decrease for overmarketings. The farm marketing quota so computed for each farm for any year shall be reduced by the number of pounds by which marketing from the farm during the immediately preceding year exceeded the farm marketing quota (after adjustments) : Provided, That if, on account of excess marketings in the preceding year, the farm marketing quota is reduced to zero pounds without reflecting the entire reduction required, the additional reduction required shall be made in subsequent marketing years.
"The fann marketing quota for a new farm shall be the number of pounds determined by the county committee with approval of the State committee to be fair and reasonable for the farm on the basis of the past burley tobacco experience of the farm operator; the land, labor, and equipment available for the production of burley tobacco; crop rotation practices, and the soil and other physical factors aii'ectin^ the production of burley tobacco: Provided., That the farm marketnig quota for any such new farm shall not exceed 50 per centum of the average of the farm marketing quotas for similar farms for which farm marketing quotas are otherwise established: Provided further. That the number of pounds allocated to all new farms shall not exceed that portion of the national reserve provided by the Secretary for establishing quotas fornewfanns.
" ( f ) When a poundage program is in effect under this section, the farm marketing quota next established for any farm shall be reduced by the amount of burley tobacco produced on any farm (1) which is marketed as having been produced on a different farm; (2) for which proof of disposition is not furnished as required by the Secretary; and

The reductions required under this subsection shall be in addition to any other adjustments made pursuant to this section.
" (g) When a poundage program is in effect under this section, farm marketing quotas (after adjustments) for burley tobacco may be leased and transferred to other farms in the same county under the *^TM^s and conditions contained in section 318 of the Act: Provided, That such leases and transfers shall be on a pound for pound basis: Provided further. That any adjustment for undermarketings or overmarketings shall be attributed to the farm to which leased and transferrcd: Provided further, That not more than fifteen thousand pounds may be leased and transferred to any farm under this section: And provided further, That the marketing quota determined for any farm subsequent to such lease and transfer shall not exceed an amount determined by multiplying the farm yield established under subsection (d) of this section by 50 per centum of the acreage of cropland in the farm.
" (h) Effective with the marketing year beginning October 1, 1976, no marketing quota, other than a new farm marketing quota, shall be established for a farm on w^hich no burley tobacco was planted or considered planted in any of the five years immediately preceding the year for which farm marketing quotas are being established.

To provide for an extension of section 10 of tlie Railway Labor Act with respect to the current railway labor-management dispute, and for other purposes.

May 18. 1971 [S. J . R e s . 100]

Whereas the labor dispute between the carriers represented by the National Railway Labor Conference and the Eastern, Western, and Southeastern Carriers Conference Committees and certain of their employees represented by the Brotherhood of Railway Signalmen threatens essential transportation services of the Nation; and
Whereas it is essential to the national interest, including the national health and defense, that essential transportation services be maintained; and
Whereas all the procedures for resolving such dispute provided for in the Railway Labor Act have been exhausted and have not resulted in settlement of the dispute; and
Whereas the Congress finds that emergency measures are essential to security and continuity of transportation services by such carriers; and
Whereas it is desirable to achieve the objectives in a manner which preserves and prefers solutions reached through collective bargaining; and
Whereas the recommendations of Presidential Emergency Board Numbered 179 for settlement of this dispute did not result in a settlement: Now, therefore, in order to encourage these parties to reach their own agreement, be it
Resolved hy the Senate and House of Rep^'esentatlves of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the provisions of the final paragraph of section 10 of the Railway Labor Act (45 U.S.C. 160) shall apply and be extended for an additional period with respect to the above dispute, so that no change, except by agreement, shall be made by the carriers represented by the National Railway Labor Conference Committees or by their employees, in the conditions out of which such dispute arose prior to 12:01 antemeridian of October 1, 1971.
SEC. 2. Not later than ten days prior to the expiration date specified in the first section of this joint resolution the Secretary of Labor shall submit to the Congress a full and comprehensive report containing--

SEC. 3. Not later than July 31,1971, the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Transportation shall submit jointly to the Congress as full and comprehensive a report as feasible on the impact of the current work stoppage. Such report shall include an analysis of all the recoverable and nonrecoverable losses suffered as a result of the stoppage; the extent to which rail traffic was diverted to other means of transportation, and the secondary effects on other industries and employment. Not later than July 31, 1971, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the Congress as full and comprehensive a report as feasible on the impact of the current stoppage on movement of goods vital to the national defense; the extent to which rail traffic was diverted to other means of transportation and the status of plans to provide for the movement of defense articles in the event of a railroad work stoppage or lockout.

SEC. 4. Notwithstanding the first section of this joint resolution, the rates of pay of all employees who are subject to the first section of this joint resolution sha 11 be increased in accordance with the following table:

Effective as of:
January 1, 1970 November 1, 1970 November 1, 1970

Pay increase
5 per centum for all employees. 30 cents per hour for leaders and mechanics. 18 cents per hour for assistants and helpers.

Nothing in this section shall prevent any change made by agreement in the increases in rates of pay provided pursuant to this section.
SEC. 5. I t is the sense of the Congi-ess that the living accommodations of some of the employees who are subject to the first section of this joint resolution, while they are on travel status, are unsatisfactory. Accordingly, the Congress does not intend, by limiting the effect of section 4 to rates of pay, to endorse the continued furnishing of substandard quarters to employees and urges management and labor to negotiate an agreement to provide, as soon as possible, substantially improved living quarters for employees on travel status.
SEC. 6. This resolution shall take effect immediately upon enactment.

Emergency Employment Act of 1971.

Public Law 92-54
AN ACT
To provide (luring times of high unemployment for programs of public service employment for unemployed persons, to assist States and local communities in providing needed public services, and for other purposes.
Be it enacted hy the Senate and House of Representatives of the Vnited States of America in Congress assembled. That this Act may be cited as the "Emergency Employment Act of 1971".
STATEMENT OF FINDINGS AND PURPOSES
SEC. 2. The Congress finds and declares that-- (1) times of high unemployment severely limit the work
opportunities available to the general population, especially lowincome persons and migrants, persons of limited English-speaking ability, and others from socioeconomic backgrounds generally associated with substantial unemployment and underemployment;
(2) expanded work opportunities fail, in times of high unemployment, to keep pace with the increased number of persons in the labor force, including the many young persons who are entering the labor force, persons who have recently been separated from military service, and older persons who desire to remain in, enter, or reenter the labor force;
(3) in times of high unemployment, many low-income persons are unable to secure or retain employment, making it especially difficult to become self-supporting and thus increasing the number of welfare recipients;
(4) many of the persons who have become unemployed or underemployed as a result of technological changes or as a result of shifts in the pattern of Federal expenditures, as in the defense, aerospace, and construction industries, could usefully be employed

85 STAT. ]

in providing needed public services; (5) it is appropriate during times of high unemployment to fill
unmet needs for public services in such fields as environmental quality, health care, housing and neighborhood improvements, recreation, education, public safety, maintenance of streets, parks, and other public facilities, rural development, transportation, beautification, conservation, crime prevention and control, prison rehabilitation, and other fields of human betterment and public improvement;
(6) programs providing transitional employment in jobs providing needed public services and related training and manpower services can be a useful component of the Nation's manpower policies in dealing with problems of high unemployment and dependency upon welfare assistance, and providing affected individuals with opportunities to develop skills and abilities to enable them to move into other public or private employment and other opportunities; and
(7) providing resources for transitional public service employment and related training and manpower services during an economic slowdown can help as an economic stabilizer both to ease the impact of unemployment for the affected individuals and to reduce the pressures which tend to generate further unemployment.
I t is therefore the purpose of this Act to provide unemployed and underemployed persons with transitional employment in jobs providing needed public services during times of high unemployment
and, wherever feasible, related training and manpower services to enable such persons to move into employment or training not supported under this Act.

FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE
SEC. 3. (a) The Secretary of Labor shall enter into arrangements wdth eligible applicants in accordance with the provisions of this Act in order to make financial assistance available during times of high unemployment for the purposes of providing transitional employment for unemployed and underemployed persons in jobs providing needed public services, and training and manpower services related to such employment which are otherwise unavailable, and enabling such persons to move into employment or training not supported under this Act.
(b) Not less than 85 per centum of the funds appropriated pursuant to this Act shall be expended only for wages and employment benefits to persons employed in public service jobs pursuant to this Act.

(2) If, at any time subsequent to the Secretary's determination under this section, the rate of national unemployment (seasonally adjusted) equals or exceeds 4.5 per centum for three consecutive months, the Secretary shall, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1), resume the obligation of funds appropriated under this section until a new determination has been made under paragraph (1).

E S T A B L I S H M E N T OP T H E BOARD
SEO. 2. There is created an Emergency Loan Guarantee Board (referred to in this Act as the "Board") composed of the Secretary of the Treasury, as Chairman, the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Decisions of the Board shall be made by majority vote.
AUTHORITY

LIMITATIONS AND CONDITIONS

SEC. 4. (a) A guarantee of a loan may be made under this Act only if--
(1) the Board finds that (A) the loan is needed to enable the borrower to continue to furnish goods or services and failure to meet this need would advei-sely and seriously affect the economy of or employment in the Nation or any region thereof, (B) credit is not otherwise available to the borrower under reasonable terms or conditions, and (C) the prospective earning power of the borrower, together with the character and value of the security pledged, furnish reasonable assurance that it will be able to repay the loan within the time fixed, and afford reasonable protection to the United States; and

this subsection, as specified in the guarantee agreement covering a loan

to any particular enterprise, if it determines that such waiver is not

inconsistent with the reasonable protection of the interests of the

United States under the guarantee.

(b) If the Board determines that the inability of an enterprise to

obtain credit without a guarantee under this Act is the result of a

failure on the part of management to exercise reasonable business

prudence in the conduct of the affairs of the enterprise, the Board shall

req[uire before guaranteeing any loan to the enterprise that the enter-

prise make such management changes as the Board deems necessary

to give the enterprise a sound managerial base.

(c) A guarantee of a loan to any enterprise shall not be made under

this Act unless--

(1) the Board has received an audited financial statement of

the enterprise; and

(2) the enterprise permits the Board to have the same access

to its books and other documents as the Board would have under

section 7 in the event the loan is guaranteed.

entered into under this Act unless the lender has exhausted any reme-

dies which it may have under the guarantee agreement.

guarantee is sought contains all the affirmative and negative covenants

" 806. Mortgage Protection Life Insurance
"(a) The Administrator is authorized, without regard to section 3709 of the Eevised Statutes, as amended (41 U.S.C. 5), to purchase from one or more life insurance companies a policy or policies of mortgage protection life insurance on a group basis to provide the benefits specified in this section.
" (b) Any policy of insurance purchased by the Administrator under this section shall be placed in effect on a date determined by the Administrator and shall automatically insure any eligible veteran who is or has been granted assistance in securing a suitable housing unit under this chapter against the death of the veteran, unless the veteran elects in writing not to be insured under this section or fails to timely respond to a request from the Administrator for information on which his premium can be based.
"(c) The initial amount of insurance provided hereunder shall not exceed the lesser of the following amounts: (1) $30,000, (2) the amount of the loan outstanding on such housing unit on the date insurance under this section is placed in effectj or (3) in the case of a veteran granted assistance in securing a housing unit on or after such date the amount of the original loan.

there is no outstanding loan on the housing unit no insurance shall be payable hereunder. If any eligible veteran elects not to be insured under this section, he may thereafter be insured hereunder only upon application, payment of required premiums, and compliance with such health requirements and other terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the Administrator.

"(d) The premium rates charged a veteran for insurance under this section shall be paid at such times and in such manner as the Administrator shall prescribe and shall be based on such mortality data as the Administrator deems appropriate to cover only the mortality cost of insuring standard lives. The Administrator is authorized and directed to deduct the premiums charged veterans for life insurance under this section from any compensation or other cash benefits payable to them by the Veterans' Administration and to pay such premiums to the insurer or insurers for such insurance. Any veterans insured hereunder not eligible for cash benefits from the Veterans' Administration may pay the amount of his premiums directly to the insurer or insurers for insurance hereunder.

Premium rates.

"(e) The United States shall bear all of the cost of the insurance Cost. provided under this section except the amount of the premium rates established for eligible veterans under subsection (d) as the mortality cost of insuring standard lives. For each month for which any eligible veteran is insured under a policy purchased under this section there shall be contributed to the insurer or insurers issuing the policy or policies from the appropriation 'Compensation and Pensions, Veterans' Administration' an amount necessary to cover the cost of the insurance in excess of the premiums established for eligible veterans, including the cost of administration and the cost of the excess mortality attributable to the veterans' disabilities. Appropriations to carry out the purposes of this section are hereby authorized.

"(f) Any amount of insurance in force under this section on the date of death of an eligible veteran insured hereunder shall be paid only to the holder of the mortgage loan, the payment of which such insurance was granted, for credit on the loan indebtedness and the liability of the insurer under such insurance shall be satisfied when such payment is made. If the Administrator is the holder of the mortgage loan, the insurance proceeds shall be credited to the loan indebtedness and, as appropriate, deposited in either the direct loan or loan guaranty revolving fund established by section 1823 or 1824 of this title, respectively.
"(g) Each policy purchased under this section shall also provide, in terms approved by the Administrator, for the following:
"(1) reinsurance, to the extent and in a manner to be determined by the Administrator to be in the best interest of the veterans or the Government, with other insurers which meet qualifying criteria established by the Administrator as may elect to participate in such reinsurance.
" (2) that at any time the Administrator determines such action to be in the best interest of veterans or the Government he may (A) discontinue the entire policy, or (B) at his option, exclude from coverage under such policy loans made after a date fixed by him for such purpose; however, any insurance previously issued to a veteran under such policy may not be canceled by the insurer solely because of termination of the policy by the Administrator with respect to new loans. If the policy is wholly discontinued, the Administrator shall have the right to require the transfer, to the extent and in a manner to be determined by him, to any new company or companies wi^h which he has negotiated a new policy or policies, the amounts, as determined by the existing

insurer or insurers with the concurrence of the Administrator of any policy or contingency reserves with respect to insurance previously in force;
"(3) issuance to each veteran insured under this section of a uniform type of certificate setting forth the benefits to w^hich he is entitled under the insurance;
"(4) any other provisions which are reasonably necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this section; and
"(5) an accounting to the Administrator not later than ninety days after the end of each policy year which shall set forth, in a form approved by the Administrator, (A) the amount of premiums paid by veterans and contributions made by the Veterans' Administration accrued under the contract or agreement from its date of issue to the end of such contract year; (B) the total of all mortality and other claim charges incurred for that period; and (C) the amount of the insurer's expense and risk charges, if any, for that period. Any excess of the total of item (A) over the sum of items (B) and (C) shall be held by the insurer as a contingency reserve to be used by such insurer for charges under the contract or agreement only. The contingency reserve shall bear interest at a rate to be determined in advance of each contract year by the insurer, which rate shall be approved by the Administrator if consistent with the rates generally used by the insurer for similar funds held under other plans of group life insurance. If and when the Administrator determines that such contingency reserve has attained an amount estimated by him to make satisfactory provision for adverse fluctuations in future charges under the contract, the Administrator shall require the insurer to adjust the premium rates and contributions so as to prevent any further substantial accretions to the contingency reserve. If and when the contract or agreement is discontinued and if after all charges have been made there is any positive balance remaining in the contingency reserve, such balance shall be payable to the Administrator and by him deposited to the appropriation 'Compensation and Pensions, Veterans' Administration,' subject to the right of the insurer to make such payment in equal monthly installments over a period of not more than two years. "(h) With respect to insurance contracted for under this section, the Administrator is authorized to adopt such regulations relating to eligibility of the veteran for insurance, maximum amount of insurance, maximum duration of insurance, and other pertinent factors not specifically provided for in this section, which in his judgment are in the best interest of veterans or the Government. Insurance contracted for under this section shall take effect as to eligible veterans heretofore granted assistance under this chapter on a date determined by the Administrator, and as to eligible veterans hereafter granted assistance under this chapter at the time of the closing of his loan. The amount of the insurance at any time shall be the amount necessary to pay the mortgage indebtedness in full, except as otherwise limited by the policy.
"(i) Insurance contracted for under this section shall terminate upon whichever of the following events first occurs:
" (1) satisfaction of the veteran's indebtedness under the loan upon which the insurance is based;
" ^2) the veteran's seventieth birthday; "(3) termination of the veteran's ownership of the property securing the loan; " ^ 4) discontinuance of payment of premiums by the veteran; or " (5) discontinuance of the entire contract or agreement, " ( j ) Termination of the mortgage protection life insurance will

(1) there are more than two thousand minority language groups of one hundred and sixty million people, most of whom live in remote areas of the world in cultural isolation without books or even an alphabet;
(2) it has been shown that these people are gifted individuals whose human resources the world is denied;
(3) the translation of literacy materials and teachings of moral and spiritual significance into minority languages, which requires that an alphabet be produced and a thorough grammatical analysis of the languages be undertaken, results in an expansion of literacy and an improvement of the cultural bases of the language groups affected;
(4) such organizations as the Summer Institute of Linguistics composed of linguistic scholars trained at the Universities of Oklahoma, North Dakota, Washington, Michigan, Indiana, California, Pennsylvania, Texas, and elsewhere have undertaken the task of bringing literacy to sxich groups;

(5) the Summer Institute of Linguistics has more than two thousand five hundred members now working in more tlian five hundred minority language groups in twenty-tliree foreign countries with the cooperation of the governments and institutions of higher learning in these countries;
(6) the cultural, economic, social, and political, and educational significance of these efforts has brought commendations from many foreign governments;
(7) the Summer Institute of Linguistics and other concerned organizations have called for the beginning of work in the remaining over two thousand minority language groups yet without even an alphabet; and
(8) these organizations, through modern science and technology, are continuing the task of freeing all the various minority groups from linguistic isolation, and they deserve our encouragement. SEC. 2. I n recognition of the international effort to provide written languages for minority language groups, the President is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation designating 1971 as the "Year of World Minority Language Groups", and inviting foreign governments, the governments of our States and communities, and all peoples to observe the year with appropriate scientific and educational activities.

Further, the Export-Import Bank shall at the same time survey a representative number of United States exporters and United States commercial lending institutions which provide export credit to determine their experience in meeting financial competition from other countries whose exporters compete with United States exporters. The results of this survey shall be included as part of the semiannual report provided for under this section. I t is further the policy of the United States that the Bank in the exercise of its functions should supplement and encourage and not compete with private capital; that the Bank shall accord equal opportunity to export agents and managers, independent export firms, and small commercial banks, in the formulation and implementation of its programs; that loans, so far as possible consistent with the carrying out of the purposes of subsection ( a ) , shall generally be for specific purposes, and, in the judgment of the Board of Directors, offer reasonable assurance of repayment; and that in authorizing such loans the Board of Directors should take into account the possible adverse effects upon the United States economy."

after the date of the enactment of the Act enacting this sentence, the President is requested to appoint the membership of each local board so
that to the maximum extent practicable it is proportionately representative of the race and national origin of those registrants within its jurisdiction, but no action by any local board shall be declared invalid on the ground that any board failed to conform to any particular quota as to race or national origin.

(33) Section 15 (d) is amended to read as follows: "(d) Except as provided in section 4(c), nothing contained in this title shall be construed to repeal, amend, or suspend the laws now in force authorizing voluntary enlistment or reenlistment in the Armed Forces of the United States, including the reserve components thereof, except that no person shall be accepted for enlistment after he has been issued an order to report for induction unless authorized by the Director and the Secretary of Defense and except that, whenever the Congress or the President has declared that the national interest is imperiled, voluntary enlistment or reenlistment in such forces, and their reserve components, may be suspended by the President to such extent as he may deem necessary in the interest of national defense."

The acreage so allocated shall be distributed on a fair and reasonable basis to new and old sugar beet farms to the extent that it can be utilized without regard to any other acreage allocations to States determined by the Secretary. At the time the Secretary allocates acreage for a new or substantially enlarged existing sugar beet processing facility for any year, which determination shall be made as far in advance of such year as practicable, such allocation shall thereby be committed to be in effect for the year in w^hich production of sugar beets is scheduled to commence or to be substantially increased in the locality or localities determined by the Secretary to receive such acreage allocation for such year, such determination by the Secretary shall be final, and such commitment of acreage allocation shall be irrevocable upon issuance of such determination of the Secretarj^ by publication in the Federal Register ; except that if the Secretary finds in any case that the construction of new or the substantial enlargement of existing sugar beet processing facilities and the contracting for processing of sugar beets has not proceeded in substantial accordance with the representations made to him as a basis for his determination of acreage allocation, he shall revoke such determination in accordance with and upon publication in the Federal Register of such findings. In determining acreage allocations for a locality or localities serving new or substantially enlarged existing sugar beet facilities and whenever proposals are made to construct new or to substantially enlarge existing sugar beet processing facilities in two or more localities (where sugar beet production is proposed to be commenced or to be substantially increased in the same year), the Secretary shall base his determination and selection upon the firmness of capital commitment, the proven suitability of the area for growing sugar beets and the relative qualifications of localities and proposals under such criteria. In making his determination under the preceding sentence, the Secretary shall give a preference to any processing facility located or to be located in or adjacent to growing areas where processing facilities were closed during 1970 or thereafter if he finds that sugar beets can and will be grown in sufficient quantity and quality to make the production of sugar beets and the operation of such facility successful.

Such acreage shall be fairly and equitably distributed to farms on the basis of land, labor, and equipment available for the production of sugarcane, and the soil and other physical factors affecting the production of sugarcane. The acreage allocation for any year shall be made as far in advance of such year as practicable, and the commitment of such acreage to the area shall be irrevocable upon issuance of such determination by publication thereof in the Federal Register, except that, if the Secretary finds in any case that construction of sugarcane facilities and the contracting for processing of sugarcane has not proceeded in substantial accordance with the representation made to him as a basis for his determination of distribution of acreage, he shall revoke such determination in accordance with and upon publication in the Federal Register of such findings. In making his determination for the establishment of a quota and the allocation of the acreage required in connection with such quota, the Secretary shall base such determination upon the firmness of capital commitment and the suitability of the area for growing sugarcane and, where two or more areas are involved, the relative qualifications of such areas under such criteria. If proportionate shares are in effect in such area in the two years immediately following the year for which the sugarcane acreage allocation is committed for any area, the total acreage of proportionate shares established for farms in such area in each such two years, shall not be less than the larger of the acreage committed to such area or the acreage which the Secretary determines to bie required to enable the area to fill its quota and provide for a normal carryover inventory."

AVhereas it appears that under the proposed apportionment of funds aA-ailable for special assistance under section 11 of the National School Lunch Act for the fiscal year ending June 30,1972 (including funds appropriated by section 32 of the Act of August 24, 1935, and made available for that purpose), only six States will receive more than 30 cents in such assistance per free or reduced price lunch; and
Whereas it appears that this amount per lunch is not adequate to enable States and schools to continue to participate in the school Ivmch program and to achieve the objectives of the National School Lunch Act, particularly that of providing a free or reduced price lunch to every needy child: Therefore be it

Reaolred hy the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America hi Congress assembled^ That, notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary of Agriculture shall until such time as a supplemental appropriation may provide additional funds for such purpose use so much of the funds appropriated by section 32 of the Act of August 24, 1935 (7 LLS.C. 612c), as may be necessary, in addition to the funds now available therefor, to carry out the purposes of section 11 of the National School Lunch Act and provide a rate of reimbursement which will assure every needy child of free or reduced price lunches during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1972, and to carry out the purposes of section 4 of the National School Lunch Act and provide an average rate of reimbursement of 6 cents per meal within each State. In determining the amount of funds needed and the requirements of the various States therefor, the Secretary shall consult with the National Advisory Council on Child Nutrition and interested parties. Funds expended under the foregoingprovisions of this resolution shall be reimbursed out of any supj)lemental appropriation hereafter enacted for the purpose of carrying out section 4 and section 111 of the National School Lunch Act, and such reimbursements shall be deposited into the fund established pursuant to section 32 of the Act of August 24, 1935, to be available for the

"(d) (1) The United States shall be entitled to recover from any school of nursing for whom a loan guarantee was made under this section the amount of any payment made pursuant to such guarantee, unless the Secretary for good cause waives such right of recovery; and, upon making any such payment, the United States shall be subrogated to all of the rights of the recipient of the payments with respect to which the guarantee was made.

"(2) In any fiscal year no loan guarantee may be made under subsection (a) and no agreement to make interest subsidy payments may be entered into under subsection (b) if the making of such guarantee or the entering into of such agreement would cause the cumulative total of--
" ( A ) the principal of the loans guaranteed under subsection (a) in such fiscal year, and
" ( B ) the principal of the loans for which no guarantee has been made under subsection (a) and with respect to which an agreement to make interest subsidy payments is entered into under subsection (b) in such fiscal year, to exceed the amount of grant funds obligated under this part in such fiscal year for construction grants; except that this paragraph shall not apply if the amount of grant funds so obligated in such fiscal year equals the sums appropriated for such fiscal year under section 801.

If and when the relative amounts of stock in a Federal intermediate ^ credit bank owned by the production credit associations are adjusted to reestablish the proportion of such stock owned by each association, as provided in the first or second paragraphs of section 2.2 (g) of this title, amounts in the reserve account that are allocated to production credit associations may be adjusted in the same manner, so far as practicable, to reestablish the holdings of the production credit associations in the allocated legal reserve accounts into substantially the same proportion as are their holdings of stock.

Such regulations may provide for the application of less than 25 per centum of net earnings after payment of operating expenses to the restoration or maintenance of the allocated reserve account, additions to unallocated contingency reserve account of not to exceed such per centum of net earnings as may be approved by the Farm Credit Administration, and provide for allocations to patrons not qualified under the Internal Revenue Code, and the payment of patronage in stock, participation certificates, or in cash, as the board may determine. If during the fiscal year but not at the end thereof a bank shall have had outstanding capital stock held by the Governor of the Farm Credit Administration, provision will be made for the payment of the franchise tax required in section 4.0.
(d) Such allocations of reserve account shall be subject to a first lien as additional collateral for any indebtedness of the holders thereof to the bank and in any case where such indebtedness is in default may, but shall not be required to, be retired and canceled for application on such indebtedness, and, in case of liquidation or dissolution of a holder thereof, such reserve account allocations may be retired, all as is provided for stock and participation certificates in section 2.2(g) of this title.

The loan documents may provide for the interest rate or rates to vary from time to time during the repayment period of the loan, in accordance with the rate or rates currently being charged by the bank.
(b) Loans shall be made upon such terms, conditions, and security, if any, as may be determined by the bank in accordance with regulations of the F a r m Credit Administration.
(c) Each bank for cooperatives shall have a first lien on all stock or other equities in the bank as collateral for the payment of any indebtedness of the owner thereof to the bank. I n the case of a direct loan to an eligible cooperative by the Central Bank, the Central Bank shall have a first lien on the stock and equities of the borrower in the district bank and the district bank shall have a lien thereon junior only to the lien of the Central Bank.
(d) I n any case where the debt of a borrower is in default, or in any case of liquidation or dissolution of a present or former borrower from a bank for cooperatives, the bank may, but shall not be required to, retire and cancel all or a part of the stock, allocated surplus or contingency reserves, or any other equity in the bank owned by or allocated to such borrower, at the fair book value thereof not exceeding par, and, to the extent required in such, cases, corresponding shares and allocations and other equity interests held by a district bank in another district bank on account of such indebtedness, shall be retired or equitably adjusted.

surplus account; (3) it shall next pay to the United States a franchise tax as provided in section 4.0 of this Act; (4) reasonable contingency reserves may be established; (5) dividends on investment stock may be declared as provided in this title; and (6) any remaining net savings shall be distributed as patronage refunds as provided in subsection (c) or (d) of this section: Provided^ That any patronage refunds received by a district bank from any other bank for cooperatives shall be excluded from net savings of the district bank for the purpose of computing such franchise tax. Amounts applied as provided in (2) above after January 1, 1956, shall be allocated on a patronage basis approved by the Farm Credit Administration. At the end of any fiscal year any portion of the reserve established under (4) above which is no longer deemed necessary shall be transferred to the surplus account and, if the surplus account of any such bank for cooperatives exceeds 25 per centum of the sum of all its outstanding capital stock, the bank may distribute in the same manner as a patronage refund any part or all of such excess which has been allocated: Provided^ That any surplus and contingency reserve shown on the books of the banks as of January 1, 1956, shall not be distributed as patronage refunds. In making such distributions except as otherwise provided in section 3.5 and distributions by the Central Bank, the oldest outstanding allocations shall be distributed first. Whenever used in this title, the words "surplus account" as applied to any bank for cooperatives shall mean any surpluses and contingency reserves shown on the books of the bank as of January 1, 1956, and any amounts accumulated as allocated or unallocated surplus after said date. Said surplus account shall be divided to show the amounts thereof subject to allocation as provided in this subsection and may be further subdivided as prescribed by the Farm Credit Administration.

"Surplus account."

(b) Whenever at the end of any fiscal year a bank for cooperatives shall have no outstanding capital stock held by the Governor of the Farm Credit Administration, the net savings shall, under regulations prescribed by the Farm Credit Administration, continue to be applied on a cooperative basis with provision for sound, adequate capitalization to meet the changing financing needs of eligible cooperative borrowers and prudent corporate fiscal management, to the end that current year's patrons carry their fair share of the capitalization, ultimate expenses, and reserves related to the year's operations and the remaining net savings shall be distributed as patronage refunds as provided in subsections (c) and (d) of this section. Such regulations may provide for application of less than 25 per centum of net savings to the restoration or maintenance of an allocated surplus account, reasonable additions to unallocated surplus, or to unallocated reserves of not to exceed such per centum of net savings after payment of operating expenses as may be approved by the Farm Credit Administration, and provide for allocations to patrons not qualified under the Internal Kevenue Code, or payment of such per centum of patronage refunds in cash, as the board may determine. If during the fiscal year but not at the end thereof a bank shall have had outstanding capital stock held by the United States, provision will be made for payment of franchise taxes required in section 4.0.

68A Stat. 3. 26 u s e 1 et

(c) The net savings of each district bank for cooperatives, after the earnings for the fiscal year have been applied in accordance with subsections (a) or (b) of this section whichever is applicable, shall be l^aid in stock or in cash, or both, as determined by the board, as patronage refunds to borrowers of the fiscal year for which such patronage refunds are distributed.

(d) The net savings of the Central Bank for Cooperatives after the earnings for the fiscal year have been applied in accordance with subsections (a) or (b) whichever is applicable, shall be paid in stock or cash, or both, as determined by the board, as patronage refunds to the district banks on the basis of interests held by the Central Bank in loans made by the district banks and upon any direct loans made by the Central Bank to cooperative associations, or on such other proportionate patronage basis as the Farm Credit Administration may approve. In cases of direct loans, such refund shall be paid to the district bank or banks which issued their stock to the borrower incident to such loans, and the district bank or banks shall issue a like amount of patronage refunds to the borrower.
(e) I n the event of a net loss in any fiscal year after providing for all operating expenses (including reasonable valuation reserves and losses in excess of any applicable reserves), such loss may be carried forward or carried back, if appropriate, or otherwise shall be absorbed by charges to unallocated reserve or surplus accounts established after the date of enactment of this Act; charges to allocated contingency reserve account; charges to allocated surplus accounts; charges to other contingency reserve and surplus accounts; the impairment of voting stock; or the impairment of all other stock.
(f) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section any costs or expenses attributable to a prior year or years but not recognized in determining the net savings for such year or years may be charged to reserves or surplus of the bank or to patronage allocations for such years, as may be determined by the board of directors.
(g) For any year that a bank for cooperatives is subject to Federal income tax, it may pay in cash such portion of its patronage refunds as will permit its taxable income to be determined without taking into account savings applied as allocated surplus, allocated contingency reserves, and patronage refunds under subsection (a) or (b) of this section.

To require the protection, management, and control of wild free-roaming horses and burros on public lands.

^^' m ^ l

Be it enacted hy the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled., That Congress finds and declares that wild free-roaming horses and burros are living symbols of the historic and pioneer spirit of the West; that they contribute to the diversity of life forms within the Nation and enrich the lives of the American people; and that these horses and burros are fast disappearing from the American scene. I t is the policy of Congress that wild free-roaming horses and burros shall be protected from capture, branding, harassment, or death; and to accomplish this they are to be considered in the area where presently found, as an integral part of the natural system of the public lands.
SEC. 2. As used in this Act-- (a) "Secretary" means the Secretary of the Interior when used
in connection with public lands administered by him through the Bureau of Land Management and the Secretary of Agriculture in connection with public lands administered by him through the Forest Service;
(b) "wild free-roaming horses and burros" means all unbranded and unclaimed horses and burros on public lands of the United States;
(c) "range" means the amount of land necessary to sustain an existing herd or herds of Avild free-roaming horses and burros, which does not exceed their known territorial limits, and which is devoted principally but not necessarily exclusively to their welfare in keeping with the multiple-use management concept for the public lands;
(d) "herd" means one or more stallions and his mares; and (e) "public lands" means any lands administered by the Secretary of the Interior through the Bureau of Land Management or by the Secretary of Agriculture through the Forest Service. SEC. 3. (a) All wild free-roaming horses and burros are hereby declared to be under the jurisdiction of the Secretary for the purpose of management and protection in accordance with the provisions of this Act. The Secretary is authorized and directed to protect and manage wild free-roaming horses and burros as components of the public lands, and he may designate and maintain specific ranges on public lands as sanctuaries for their protection and preservation, where the Secretary after consultation with the wildlife agency of the State wherein any such range is proposed and with the Advisory Board established in section 7 of this Act deems such action desirable. Tlie Secretary shall manage wild free-roaming horses and burros in a manner that is designed to achieve and maintain a thriving natural ecological balance on the public lands. He shall consider the recommendations of qualified scientists in the field of biology and ecology, some of whom shall be independent of both Federal and State agencies and may include members of the Advisory Board established in section 7 of this Act. All management activities shall be at the minimal feasible level and shall be carried out in consultation with the wildlife agency of the State wherein such lands are located in order to protect the natural ecological balance of all wildlife species which inhabit such lands, particularly endangered wildlife species. Any adjustments in forage allocations on any such lands shall take into consideration the needs of other wildlife species which inhabit such lands.

" ( A ) the agreement to have been unconscionable at the time it was made, or to have been induced by unconscionable conduct, the court may refuse to enforce the agreement, or

(c) no provision of this Act shall replace or diminish any right, privilege, or obligation of Natives as citizens of the United States or of Alaska, or relieve, replace, or diminish any obligation of the United States or of the State or Alaska to protect and promote the rights or welfare of Natives as citizens of the United States or of Alaska; the Secretary is authorized and directed, together with other appropriate agencies of the United States Government, to make a study of all Federal programs primarily designed to benefit Native people and to report back to the Congress with his recommendations for the future management and operation of these programs within three years of the date of enactment of this Act;
(d) no provision of this Act shall constitute a precedent for reopening, renegotiating, or legislating upon any past settlement involving land claims or other matters with any Native organizations, or any tribe, band, or identifiable group of American Indians;

(g) no provision of this Act shall be construed to terminate or otherwise curtail the activities of the Economic Development Administration or other Federal agencies conducting loan or loan and grant programs in Alaska. For this purpose only, the terms "Indian reservation" and "trust or restricted Indian-owned land areas" in Public Law 89-136, the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965, as amended, shall be interpreted to include lands granted to Natives under this Act as long as such lands remain in the ownership of the Native villages or the Regional Corporations.

NATIVE LAND SELECTIONS

SEC. 12. (a) (1) During a period of three years from the date of enactment of this Act, the Village Corporation for each Native village identified pursuant to section 11 shall select, in accordance with rules established by the Secretary, all of the township or townships in which any part of the village is located, plus an area that will make the total selection equal to the acreage to which the village is entitled under section 14. The selection shall be made from lands withdrawn by subsection 11 (a) : Provided^ That no Village Corporation may select more than 69,120 acres from lands withdrawn by subsection 11(a) (2), and not more than 69,120 acres from the National Wildlife Refuge System, and not more than 69,120 acres in a National Forest: Provided further^ That when a Village Corporation selects the surface estate to lands within the National Wildlife Refuge System or Naval Petroleum Reserve Numbered 4, the Regional Corporation for that region may select the subsurface estate in an equal acreage from other lands withdrawn by subsection 11(a) within the region, if possible.
(2) Selections made under this subsection (a) shall be contiguous and in reasonably compact tracts, except as separated by bodies of water or by lands which are unavailable for selection, and shall be in whole sections and, wherever feasible, in units of not less than 1,280 acres.
(b) The difference between twenty-two million acres and the total acreage selected by Village Corporations pursuant to subsection (a)
shall be allocated by the Secretary among the eleven Regional Corporations (which excludes the Regional Corporation for southeastern Alaska) on the basis of the number of Natives enrolled in each region. Each Regional Corporation shall reallocate such acreage among the Native villages within the region on an equitable basis after considering historic use, subsistence needs, and population. The action of the Secretary or the Corporation shall not be subject to judicial review. Each Village Corporation shall select the acreage allocated to it from the lands withdrawn by subsection 11 ( a ) .
(c) The difference between thirty-eight million acres and the 22 million acres selected by Village Corporations pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) shall be allocated among the eleven Regional Corporations (which excludes the Regional Corporation for southeastern Alaska) as follows:
(1) The number of acres each Regional Corporation is entitled to receive shall be computed (A) by determining on the basis of available data the percentage of all land in Alaska (excluding the southeastern region) that is within each of the eleven regions, (B) by applying that percentage to thirty-eight million acres reduced by the acreage in the southeastern region that is to be selected pursuant to section 16, and (C) by deducting from the figure so computed the number of acres within that region selected pursuant to subsections (a) and (b).
(2) I n the event that the total number of acres selected within a region pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) exceeds the percentage of the reduced thirty-eight million acres allotted to that region pursuant

For each region so affected the difference between the acreage calculated pursuant to subsection (c) (1) (B) and the acreage selected pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) shall be deducted from the acreage calculated under subsection (c) (1) (C) for the remaining regions which will select lands under this subsection (c). The reductions shall be apportioned among the remaining regions so that each region's share of the total reduction bears the same proportion to the total reduction as the total land area in that region (as calculated pursuant to subsection (c) (1) (A) bears to the total land area in all of the regions whose allotments are to be reduced pursuant to this paragraph.
(3) Before the end of the fourth year after the date of enactment of this Act, each Regional Corporation shall select the acreage allocated to it from the lands within the region withdrawn pursuant to subsection 11(a) (1), and from the lands within the region withdrawn pursuant to subsection 11(a) (3) to the extent lands withdrawn pursuant to subsection 11(a) (1) are not sufficient to satisfy its allocation: Provided^ That within the lands withdrawn by subsection 11(a) (1) the Regional Corporation may select only even numbered townships in even numbered ranges, and only odd numbered townships in odd numbered ranges.
(d) To insure that the Village Corporation for the Native village at Dutch Harbor, if found eligible for land grants under this Act, has a full opportunity to select lands within and near the village, no federally owned lands, whether improved or not, shall be disposed of pursuant to the Federal surplus property disposal laws for a period of two years from the date of enactment of this Act. The Village Corporation may select such lands and improvements and receive patent to them pursuant to subsection 14(a) of this Act.
(e) Any dispute over the land selection rights and the boundaries of Village Corporations shall be resolved by a board of arbitrators consisting of one person selected by each of the Village Corporations involved, and an additional one or two persons, whichever is needed to make an odd number of arbitrators, such additional person or persons to be selected by the arbitrators selected by the Village Corporations.

The administration of such lease, contract, permit, right-ofway, or easement shall continue to be by the State or the United States, unless the agency responsible for administration waives administration. In the event that the patent does not cover all of the land embraced within any such lease, contract, permit, right-of-way, or easement, the patentee shall only be entitled to the proportionate amount of the revenues reserved under such lease, contract, permit, right-of-way, or easement by the State or the United States which results from multiplying the total of such revenues by a fraction in which the numerator is the acreage of such lease, contract, permit, right-of-way, or easement which is included in the patent and the denominator is the total acreage contained in such lease, contract, permit, right-of-way, or easement.

zation of interest rates and finance charges, unless he issues a deter-

mination, accompanied by a statement of reasons, that such regulations

(2) The Congress finds that the persistence of inflationary pressures, and of a high rate of unemployment, the underutilization and obsolescence of production facilities, and the inadequacy of productivity are damaging to the effort to stabilize the economy.
(3) The Congress, therefore, finds a national need to increase economic productivity which depends on the effectiveness of management, the investment of capital for research, development, and advanced technology and on the training and motivation of the American worker.
(4) The Congress further finds that at a time when economic stabilization programs require price-wage restraints, management and labor have a strong mutual interest in containing "cost-push" inflation and increasing output per man-hour so that real wages may increase without causing increased prices, and that, without in any way infringing on the rights of management or labor, machinery should be provided for translating this mutuality of interest into voluntary action.

Resolved hy the Senate {the House of Representatives concurring) ^ That it is the sense of Congress that the Public Health Service hospitals and outpatient clinics, and the clinical research center located at Lexington, Kentucky, should remain open and remain within the Public Health Service at this time. The importance of health care delivery in Urban and rural areas is so great that the Administration should fund and staff these facilities at a sufficient level to allow them to perforip their multiple responsibilities during the entire fiscal year 1972. During this period, the Secretary and the Congress should explore the resources and capabilities of these facilities in their communities, to determine which facilities should continue to be operated by the Public Health Service, which facilities should be converted to community operation, and which facilities, if any, should be closed.

American Heart Month, 1971

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

January 22, 1971

The special effort to combat diseases of the heart and circulation initiated in the United States more than twenty years ago has been tremendously successful. Advances have been made in every aspect of cardiovascular medicine--in basic understanding, in preventive measures, in methods of diagnosis, in instrumentation, in surgical treatment, in drug therapy, in patient care, in rehabilitation. Heart victims everywhere have enormously benefited.
This progress is clearly reflected in our overall cardiovascular mortality rate, which has been reduced more than 14 percent. However, there is much to be done before this killer disease is conquered. Heart and blood vessel diseases still afflict more than 27 million persons in our country. They take over one million lives annually and they exact a tremendous toll in suffering, disability, and economic loss.
The progress we have witnessed these past years has been achieved primarily because of the programs supported by the Federal Government's National Heart and Lung Institute and the American Heart Association, a private voluntary agency. Allied with other public and private interests by common purpose, they constitute a continuing force for progress in reducing death and disability from cardiovascular causes. To sustain the forward march, however, the concern and support of all Americans is needed. With this support, the conquest of heart disease can be an attainable goal.

I urge the people of the United States to give heed to the nationwide problem of heart disease and to support the programs essential to bring about its solution.

National Safe Boating Week, 1971

January 28, 1971

By the President of the United States of America

36 u s e 161.

A Proclamation
More Americans each year are choosing boating as the ideal way to relax with their families and friends. All too often, however, what starts out as a pleasant cruise ends in tragedy because boatmen fail to teach their families to swim, fail to properly equip their craft with life preservers and other protective devices, or fail to instruct their passengers on the use of such devices prior to a boating cruise.
Every year, about 1,300 lives are lost in boating accidents. These fatalities can be reduced and boating made more pleasurable if those who engage in it will emphasize boating safety rules.
Recognizing the need for that emphasis, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved June 4, 1958 (72 Stat. 179), has requested the President to proclaim annually the week which includes July 4 as National Safe Boating Week.

I also invite the Governors of the States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to provide for the observance of this week.

USO Day
By the President of the United States of America

February 2, 1971

A Proclamation

On February 4, 1971, the United Service Organizations, affectionately known as the USO, will celebrate its thirtieth anniversary.
Its exclusive mission, since its beginning prior to World War II, has been to serve the morale, spiritual, recreational, and entertainment needs of the Armed Forces.
In war and peace the USO, with its thousands of patriotic volunteers, has kept the faith with millions of Americans as they have been called into the service of their nation.
Neither asking for nor receiving any financial support from the Government, the USO has been described as an expression of the continuing concern of Main Street America for its sons and daughters in uniform, wherever they serve.
For the past three decades, the American people have voluntarily given their support, both financial and personal, to bolster the morale of our servicemen and women through the operation of the USO. It continues to give an answer to the two questions always on the minds of the young men and women in uniform, "Does anyone know I'm here?" and "Does anyone care?".

A Proclamation

Although the number of children who die from poisoning has been declining, approximately 75,000 accidental poisonings and some 300 deaths among children under the age of five are still reported every year. Young children cannot differentiate between things that are meant to be swallowed and those that are not meant to be swallowed. We adults must make this distinction, and we must be constantly on the alert to avoid a poisoning incident.

The Poison Prevention Packaging Act, which I recently signed into law, will provide for child-resistant containers for toxic or harmful household substances, and will help to end the tragedy of childhood poisonings.

Proclaiming the Suspension of the Davis-Bacon Act of March 3, 1931

By the President of the United States of America

February 23, 1971

A Proclamation

Section 1 of the Davis-Bacon Act of March 3, 1931 (46 Stat. 1494, as amended, 40 U.S.C. 276a), provides:
". . . every contract in excess of $2,000, to which the United States or the District of Columbia is a party, for construction, alteration, and/or repair, including painting and decorating, of public buildings or public works of the United States or the District of Columbia within the geographical limits of the States of the Union, or the District of Columbia, and which requires or involves the employment of mechanics and/or laborers shall contain a provision stating the minimum wages to be paid various classes of laborers and mechanics which shall be based upon the wages that will be determined by the Secretary of Labor to be prevailing for the corresponding classes of laborers and mechanics employed on projects of a character similar to the contract work in the city, town, village, or other civil subdivision of the State in which the work is to be performed, or in the District of Columbia if the work is to be performed there . . .";

49 Stat. 1011; 78 Stat. 238.

Various other acts provide for the payment of wages, with these provisions dependent upon determinations by the Secretary of Labor under the Davis-Bacon Act.

The Nation is now confronted by a set of conditions involving the construction industry which, taken together, create an emergency situation:

880

PROCLAMATION 4031-FEB. 23, 1971

[85 STAT.

--Construction industry collective bargaining settlements are excessive and show no signs of decelerating,

--Increased unemployment and more frequent and longer work stoppages in the construction industry have accompanied the excessive and accelerating wage demands and settlements in the construction industry.

--The excessive and accelerating wage settlements in the construction industry have affected collective bargaining in other industries, thus contributing to inflation in the overall economy.
--This combination of factors in the construction industry has threatened the basic economic stability of the construction industry and thus the Nation's economy.

--Construction industry employers and employee representatives have been unable voluntarily to agree upon any arrangement which would ameliorate these conditions.

--The Federal Government is planning to expand its direct and financially-assisted construction, in part to reduce unemployment in the construction industry and in the national economy.

--The Federal Government anticipates that a larger portion of total resources will be devoted to construction activity as the economy expands.

40 u^c' 276^'

-- ^ ^ ^ Davis-Bacon Act and other acts dependent upon it frequently require contractors working on federally involved projects to pay the high negotiated wage settlements to mechanics and laborers, thereby sanctioning and spreading the high rates and thus inducing further acceleration contributing to the threat to the Nation's economy.

40 u s e 276a-5. Section 6 of the Davis-Bacon Act provides:

"In the event of a national emergency the President is authorized to suspend the provisions of this Act."

WHEREAS I find that a national emergency exists within the meaning of section 6 of the Davis-Bacon Act of March 3, 1931 (46 Stat. 1494, as amended, 40 U.S.C. 276a).

PROCLAMATION 4032
Law Day, U.S.A., 1971
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

March 2, 1971

Change is the immutable first law of nature, and governments reveal themselves most in the manner by which they provide for change. History is littered with the remains of governments that failed to meet this challenge : of those that gave too great a scope to unbridled impulse, and of those that gave too little scope to the human spirit.
Between these two extremes--between the tyranny of anarchy and the tyranny of totalitarianism--the law has its dominion. Our forefathers established government and founded a free nation on that high place. They gave us laws that could be changed by orderly process so that the nation and its people might remain free.
This ability to change by orderly process is essential to democratic government, for the success of such a form of government depends upon a capacity constantly to resolve the basic paradox of a system of liberty under law: that the supremacy of the law rests on its recognition of the supremacy of the people.
The continuing success of America testifies to the wisdom with which the founders of this nation addressed this paradox, and to the legal skill with which they resolved it.
It is fitting that we honor not merely the law, but the lawgivers, and that we honor above all those citizens who keep the law.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, R I C H A R D N I X O N , President of the United States of America, do hereby urge the people of the United States to observe Saturday, May 1, 1971, as Law Day in the United States of America with appropriate public ceremonies and by the reaffirmation of their dedication to our form of government and the su-

premacy of law in our lives. I especially urge the legal profession, the schools and educational institutions, civic and service organizations, all media of public information, and the courts to take the lead in sponsoring and participating in appropriate observances throughout the nation.
And, as requested by the Congress, I direct the appropriate Government officials to display the flag of the United States on all public buildings on that day.

Red Cross Month, 1971
^^ ^^^ President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The highest ideal of mankind is love, and the great challenge is to infuse love into the decisions and actions of daily living. "Love cannot be a mere abstraction," the American religious leader Mary Baker Eddy wrote nearly a century ago; we must "make strong demands on love, call for active witnesses to prove it, and noble sacrifices and grand achievements as its results." At about the same time, her contemporary Clara Barton was founding an organization that meets this challenge superbly--the American Red Cross.
Today the hands of the Red Cross reach across the Nation and, through the League of Red Cross Societies, around the world, to bring relief wherever disaster, disease, misfortune, or war causes human suffering. The American Red Cross is chartered by Congress but its financing is purely voluntary, compelled by compassion alone. The success of its vital humanitarian mission rests upon generous gifts of time and money from millions of Americans.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, R I C H A R D NIXON, President of the United States of America, and Honorary Chairman of the American National Red Cross, do hereby designate March 1971, as Red Cross Month, a month when the organization will appeal for your active help. I urge every American to measure his contribution of dollars and skills

Save Your Vision Week, 1971

March 4, 1971

The greatest tragedy of blindness is that it may be needless.
Much can be done to preserve sight by regular and thorough eye examinations, beginning early in life, and by promoting eye safety on the job, in schools, and at home.
Early detection can prevent glaucoma and prompt treatment can restore the vision lost because of cataracts. Healthy tissue can be transplanted to restore sight.
On the other hand, there are many causes of blindness or visual disability that science cannot yet prevent or treat. Only research can provide the answers to visual problems such as disorders of the retina, inherited vision defects, and blindness from long-standing diabetes.
The Federal Government conducts and supports such research in the recently established National Eye Institute of the National Institutes of Health and in laboratories across the Nation. This effort by the Government complements the many excellent activities of private and voluntary groups in supporting research and in providing services to the blind and visually handicapped.
In an effort to make Americans better aware of how sight may be preserved, the Congress by a joint resolution approved December 30, 1963 (77 Stat. 629), requested the President to proclaim the first week in March of each year as Save Your Vision Week.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, RICHARD NIXON, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week of March 7, 1971, as Save Your Vision Week; and I invite appropriate officials of State and local governments to issue similar proclamations.

From the beginning of our country, Americans have worked together voluntarily to help master common needs and problems. This year marks the seventy-fifth anniversary of one of the Nation's leading voluntary action organizations, the Volunteers of America, devoted to solving the spiritual and social problems of our needy.
In recognition of the work of this humanitarian organization, the Congress, by House Joint Resolution 337, has requested the President to designate the second week of March 1971 as Volunteers of America Week.

Loyalty Day, 1971

By the President of the United States of America

March lo, i9yji_

A Proclamation

In this time, as throughout our history, the American nation rests fully and finally upon the loyalty of the American people.

Every day Americans around the globe bear witness to their national allegiance. In doing so, some bear final witness by giving up their lives for the life of this Nation. Not all are called to that extremity. But all are called to that degree of devotion. For that reason it is fitting that we set aside one day in the year when every citizen may pause to reflect on his own debt to the devotion of other Americans, and to bear witness in every appropriate way to his own loyalty.

To that end the Congress by a joint resolution of July 18, 1958, has designated May 1 of each year as Loyalty Day and requested the President to issue a proclamation inviting the people of the United States to observe such day with appropriate ceremonies.

72 Stat. 369. 36 u s e 162.

NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, RICHARD N I X O N , President of the United States of America, do call upon the people of the United States, and upon all patriotic, civic, and educational organizations, to observe Saturday, May 1, 1971 as Loyalty Day, with appropriate ceremonies in which all of us may join in a reaffirmation of our loyalty to the United States of America.

I also call upon appropriate officials of the Government to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on that day as a manifestation of our loyalty to the Nation which that flag symbolizes.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-one and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-fifth.

A Proclamation
The first American still being held by the enemy was captured in South Vietnam on March 26, 1964. Now, with the seventh anniversary of that event approaching, the number of Americans missing in action or known captured in the Vietnamese conflict has grown to about 1,600. Most of these men are officers and enlisted men of the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and the Marine Corps; some are civilians. Even in captivity, they continue to serve our Nation in the highest sense of honor and duty to country. We owe them, in turn, no less than our strongest support and our firmest pledge that we will neither forget them nor abandon them.
This Government has made and will continue to make strenuous efforts in behalf of these Americans who are prisoners of war or missing in action. In the face of the enemy's callous indifference to the plight of these men and their families, we have sought to focus the attention of the world on the barbaric attitude of North Vietnam and its agents throughout Indochina. We have conducted vigorous diplomatic efforts to resolve the prisoner of war problem on a purely humane basis for the prisoners we hold as well as for our brave men held prisoner.
The Geneva Prisoner of War Convention of 1949 sets forth the minimum standards for humanitarian treatment applying to all prisoners of war. Some 125 nations including all of those involved on both sides in the Southeast Asia hostilities have acceded to the Geneva Convention and have pledged to observe its humane standards. And on a moral plane above and apart from these formal rules, all civilized peoples are subject to the basic humanitarian standards long established in international law and custom.
In view of the continuing disregard of this Convention and basic humane standards by North Vietnam and its agents--their refusal to identify all of the Americans being held, to permit impartial inspection of their camps, to release the seriously sick and wounded prisoners, to provide humane treatment, and to permit prisoners to correspond regularly with their families--and in view of their adamant refusal to consider

I call upon all the people of the United States to observe this week in heartfelt prayer, and in ceremonies and activities appropriate to voice deep concern for the prisoners and missing men, to inspire their loved ones with new courage and hope, and to hasten the day when their ordeal may end.

A Proclamation
This Nation may stand on the threshold of one of the greatest triumphs in human history--the conquest of cancer. If we can now achieve that great goal, we will have lifted from the human family forever the pain, the suffering and the unbearable fear of that most dreaded of all diseases.
Decades of research have brought us at last to the moment when scientists can look with renewed hope toward victories in the prevention and treatment of cancer. This moment presents an opportunity that we dare not pass up. The lives of millions now living and countiess more yet unborn can be touched--and saved--by what we do.
I have proposed a bold new effort to bring us closer to the goal we seek. I have asked for an additional $100 million this year to press toward the conquest of cancer. I know that money alone cannot guarantee victory in a struggle as complex and difficult as this. But I also

know that this search can be quickened by great strides. When they occur, we must be ready to seize upon them and grasp, if we can, the prize that has been sought for so long.
Just as the whole world could benefit from this effort, the whole Nation must be behind it. The Congress, by joint resolution of March 28, 1938 (52 Stat. 148) requested that the President issue annually a proclamation setting aside the month of April as Cancer Control Month.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, R I C H A R D N I X O N , President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the month of April 1971 as Cancer Control Month, and I invite the Governors of the States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the appropriate officials of all other areas under the United States flag to issue similar proclamations.
To give new emphasis to this serious problem, and to encourage the determination of the American people to resolve it, I also ask the medical and allied health professions, the communications industries, and all other interested persons and groups to unite during the appointed month in public reaffirmation of this Nation's efforts to control cancer.

National Defense Transportation Day and National Transportation Week, 1971

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
The past growth and prosperity of the United States relied heavily on an interconnected, diversified transportation network which linked its cities and its citizens. Our commerce prospered from the everincreasing proximity of the markets; our citizens, from the availability and accessibility of the great productive wealth of the Nation.
We are now entering into a new era in transportation--an era in which our national mobility will demand the continued conquest of time and space, yet our national conscience will no longer permit irreparable damage to our land, our environment, or the social fabric of our communities. It is in this light that transportation faces its challenge of the future.
To meet that challenge, we will need a truly balanced transportation system--a system that provides our citizens with the ability to choose the most efficient means of transportation at the least possible cost to themselves and to the environment. I ask for the help of all citizens in achieving this goal.
In recognition of the importance of our transportation system to our economy, our national security and our daily lives, and as a tribute to

All that we do, all that we hope to achieve for ourselves, all that we hope to create for our children will go for nothing if the world itself is made unfit to live in. The question of what we do with our environment is a matter of cosmic consequence; there is a limit to how long the matter rests merely with man, and if that limit is exceeded, the success of man as an earth creature may itself be limited by forces he no longer controls.
The earth and its atmosphere are a closed system. They are finite. The good water cannot purify itself indefinitely. The good air cannot cleanse itself endlessly. And the good earth cannot sustain and repair the injustices of man forever. Man must help to put his own earthly house in order.
We have made a beginning in this. But we have only begun. Now there must be a conscious, sustained effort by every American and, we

All elements of the maritime industry should utilize the opportunity provided by that Act to develop an American merchant marine fully capable of providing the modem, efficient services which are indispensable both to our foreign commerce and to our security.

To remind Americans of the important role which the merchant marine plays in our national life, the Congress in 1933 designated the anniversary of the first transatlantic voyage by a steamship, the SS Savannah, on May 22, 1819, as National Maritime Day, and requested the President to issue a proclamation annually in observance of that day.

Primitive man's first discoveries about cultivating the land came by chance, and for thousands of years thereafter agriculture progressed only slowly out of the realm of guesswork. Even in the early days of this Nation, when we were a people of farmers and planters, the process of coaxing life out of the earth remained far more an art than a science. But today American agriculture has become a fully realized technology largely subject to human planning and control--a bountiful producer of food, clothing, and the makings of the good life for America and the world.
Thus there is sharp irony in the fact that this great industry, so accomplished in the scientific nurture of plant and animal life, remains among the industries in which human life is most precarious and accident rates are highest. The farm and ranch environment abounds in potential hazards--powerful machinery, exposed working conditions, physically demanding jobs--but experience has shown that caution, common sense, and protective equipment can do much to counter them and keep accidents and injuries to a minimum. All who live and work on America's farms and ranches owe it to themselves, their families, and the nation that depends on them, to put safety first. Let us set the goal of eliminating chance from rural life just as we have learned to exclude it from agricultural production.

Small Business Week, 1971

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

APHI S, 1971

The American tradition of independent enterprise is as old as our society itself. The freemen who tended little stores, ran coastwise shipping, traded in furs, or made candles helped this tradition put down deep roots early in our history. "What most astonishes me," wrote de Tocqueville as he took the measure of our young nation in the 1830s, "is not so much the marvelous grandeur of some undertakings as the innumerable multitude of small ones." From such beginnings, small business has grown into one of the principal economic forces in this, the world's greatest industrial nation.
Today--its name aside--small business is big. Nineteen United States firms in twenty are small businesses. They do nearly three-fourths of the total volume of sales and one-third of all manufacturing. For the industry and resourcefulness which millions of Americans invest in them as owners and employees, they return not only profits but also the rich rewards of self-reliance. They contribute to the wide diversity of our society and our economy, and they offer members of disadvantaged minority groups an open door into full participation in the Nation's prosperity--a door through which black Americans, Spanish-speaking Americans, Indians, and other minority enterprisers are now passing in increasing numbers.
But if small business is to realize its full potential in the years ahead, it needs and deserves wholehearted support from citizens and the business

April 14 marks the eighty-first anniversary of the founding of the world's oldest regional grouping of nations, the inter-American system now called the Organization of American States.
^
The name of the system has changed over the years, but its objectives have not. It was Simon Bolivar's dream of 150 years ago--that the freedom of the New World would be the hope of the universe--which inspired the creation of the inter-American system. And it is that aspiration which still unites the peoples of the Western Hemisphere in the structure of peace and the pursuit of progress, transcending our diversity of languages and cultures.
The United States, as the oldest republic in the Americas and a founding member of the inter-American system, has long been pledged to lend its full weight to the work of realizing Bolivar's dream. I have renewed that pledge for the Seventies, with special emphasis on equal partnership and full participation for all the New World nations.
The Organization of American States has long outlived the farsighted men who laid the foundations of hemispheric cooperation eight decades ago. It has gained steadily in stature as a force for a better life in the

Trade between nations is an expression of mutual dependence and good will. The international flow of goods is an instrument of world cooperation that fosters the well-being of peoples.
A strong position in world trade and investment has become a basic pillar of the American economy. It also helps raise the standards of living of other peoples of the world by making more widely available our advanced technologies and our capital.
Now, more than ever before, the United States must seek to strengthen its role as a key supplier to the global marketplace. An increased international effort will accelerate foreign exchange earnings, strengthen the position of the dollar abroad and enable us to meet our responsibilities to the international community. It will also provide added stimulus to our economy at home as it moves towards our national objective of full employment through increased productivity.

From its beginnings, the American Nation has been dedicated to the constant pursuit of better tomorrows. Yet, for many of our 20 million older Americans the "tomorrows" that arrive with their later years have not been better. Rather than days of reward, happiness, and opportunity, they have too often been days of disappointment, loneliness, and anxiety. It is imperative that this situation be changed.
Some of the problems of older Americans have their roots in economic causes. For example, the incidence of poverty is more than twice as great among older Americans as among those under 65. This is especially tragic because many of these people did not become poor until they reached their later years. Moreover, the economic gap between the age groups has been accompanied in recent years by a growing sense of social and psychological separation, so that too often our older citizens are regarded as an unwanted generation.
The generation of Americans over 65 have lived through a particularly challenging time in world history. The fact that our country has come through the first two-thirds of the twentieth century as a strong and growing Nation is the direct result of their devotion and their resourcefulness. We owe them a great deal--not only for what they have done in the past but also for what they are continuing to do today. Perhaps the greatest error which younger Americans make in dealing with the elderly is to underestimate the energy and skill which they can still contribute to their country.
During the last year, several hundred thousand older people wrote to officials of the Federal Government and told us in their own words--

some sad, some hopeful--about what they need and what they desire. We learned once again that what they seek most of all is a continuing role in shaping the destiny of their society. We must find new ways for helping them play such a role--an undertaking which will require a basic change in the attitudes of many Americans who are not yet elderly.
As a part of our effort to achieve such changes, our Nation each year observes the month of May as Senior Citizens Month. This is a time when we make a special effort to thank our older citizens for all they have contributed to America's progress. It is also a time for asking with special force whether tncy are now sharing in that progress as fully as they deserve and desire and for renewing our efforts to help them live proud and fulfilling lives.
Senior Citizens Month, 1971, will be a particularly important time for such endeavors, for this is the year of the White House Conference on Aging. The Governor of every State has issued a call for a State Conference on Aging to be held during May. From these State conferences will come policy recommendations which will be submitted to the White House Conference in Washington next November.
I know that the work of these State conferences during Senior Citizens Month--like the work of the White House Conference next autumn-- will be undertaken with a high sense of discipline, commitment, and imagination. The Nation owes no less to those who have given so much to its development.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, R I C H A R D NIXON, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate May, 1971, as Senior Citizens Month. The theme for this month will be Toward a National Policy on Aging.
I am deeply grateful to the Governors for their concern and participation in this observance. I urge officials of government at all levels-- national, State, and local--and of voluntary organizations and private groups to give special attention to the problems of older Americans during this period.
I also call upon individual citizens of all ages to take fuU advantage of this opportunity to share in designing a better future--for those who are now numbered among our older citizens and for all who will be among that number someday.
IN WITNESS W H E R E O F , I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-fifth.

Clean Waters for America Week, 1971

April 30,1971

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

84 Stat. 1589.

The United States has a proud record of facing up to great challenges by taking the decisive action required to meet them. Perhaps the greatest challenge to America in the 1970s will be ending the wasteful and destructive practices which have so seriously degraded our environment.
For too many years, we Americans have taken our natural resources for granted, confident that the abundant land of our forefathers would always provide enough fresh air, good water, and open space for every need.
The truth is that no new sources of fresh water have been uncovered in America for many years. At the same time, population growth and technological advances have tremendously increased both the overall and the per capita consumption of water, while inadequate treatment of wastes has contaminated more and more of our water resources.
We must act quickly and effectively to protect our waters from further deterioration and to treat wastes so the water may be used again. Only in this way will future generations of Americans be assured of an adequate supply of clean water.
To call attention to the need for a continuous program for the control and elimination of water pollution, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved December 28, 1970, requested the President to issue a proclamation designating the first full calendar week in May of 1971 as Clean Waters for America Week.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, RICHARD NIXON, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning May 2, 1971, as Clean Waters for America Week.
I urge all Americans, and interested groups and organizations, to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and educational programs, and to support community. State, and Federal efforts to clean up our national waterways and to adopt new habits and practices which will contribute to the enhancement of water quality in this country.
I also invite the Governors of the States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the Commissioner of the District of Columbia to provide for the observance of this week.

National Employ The Older Worker Week, 1971
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

May 5,1971

The skills, the wisdom and the strength of older Americans constitute a great resource for our country. Unfortunately, it is a resource which has not been adequately used. Too many of our older citizens are denied opportunities for employment simply because of their age. Yet each year thousands of older workers demonstrate in convincing fashion that age is not a bar to efficient and productive labor.
Often, in fact, just the opposite is the case. For the older worker brings to his job a range and depth of experience which makes his efforts especially valuable.
The more I learn about older men and women, the more convinced I become of this central fact: what those who have reached retirement age desire most of all in life is the chance to continue their service to society. They want to be useful members of the community--independent and self-reliant citizens who are regarded as full participants in our national life.
I believe very strongly that these men and women, who have already given so much to our country, deserve every chance to fulfill this desire. They will benefit enormously from such opportunities, and our- society will benefit even more.
The Congress, by joint resolution approved December 28, 1970, has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation designating the first full calendar week in May of 1971, as "National Employ the Older Worker Week."

Throughout this Nation's history, American mothers have played a very special role--helping to pioneer the land, enriching our community life, and bringing deeper meaning to the lives of their husbands and children.
In recent years we have come to appreciate more than ever before the influential contribution mothers can make in the extended community beyond the home. But even as new horizons are opened for many mothers, each mother's responsibility to her children still defines her central role.
In our society, we want to see each person fulfill his unique potential. It is fitting therefore that we recognize and honor the part that mothers play in the development of their children--even as we welcome new opportunities for mothers to contribute to the Nation's life.
' ^ ^ Congress, by a joint resolution of May 8, 1914, has set aside the second Sunday of May of each year as a day on which we honor all mothers for their countless contributions to their own families, to their communities, and to the Nation.

Great progress has been made in the fight against disease and disability during the past few decades. Now, with the major infectious diseases under control, medical research is giving increased attention to diseases which originate within the body such as the disabling neurological disorders.
Among the illnesses which present the greatest challenge at the present time is multiple sclerosis. Of the hundreds of thousands of Americans who suffer from diseases of the central nervous system, many are the victims of this crippling illness.
Advances in medicine result from the combined efforts of private physicians, research scientists--both in and outside of government--and voluntary health agencies such as the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, which was established over 20 years ago.
To focus the attention of the American people on the national effort to find the cause of multiple sclerosis and its cure, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved December 28, 1970, has requested the President to proclaim the period from May 9, 1971, Mother's Day, through June 20,

A Proclamation

The fabric of American society is woven around the family and at the center of the family is the father.
Fatherhood can be one of the most enriching and most satisfying experiences in a man's life. But the role of the father is not an easy one. Often, his sacrifices are taken for granted, and--even at the times of greatest stress--he must always stand steady, providing the strength and stability on which a sound family life depends.
A man does not need to be applauded or given a citation for being a good father. Fatherhood is its own reward. But it is appropriate that the Nation pause every so often to recognize the contributions which the fathers of America have made to their families, their communities, and their country.
To that end, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved December 28, 1970, designated the third Sunday in June of 1971 as Father's Day and requested the President to issue a proclamation calling for its observance.

May 27, 1971

It is a tradition of our Nation, as it is a tradition of most nations, to pay homage to those who have fallen in defense of our land, our people, and our principles. These men and women honor America by their sacrifice. It is for America to honor them by its devotion to those purposes for which they perished.
We cannot dismiss with easy platitudes the debt which the deaths of our countrymen lays upon us. And while the declaration of noble sentiments, the placing of flowers and the shedding of tears of remembrance can pay deserved tribute to their sacrifices, these by themselves cannot redeem those sacrifices. So let us bear witness to the plain truth

908 64 Stat. 158.

PROCLAMATION 4056-MAY 27, 1971

[85 STAT.

that we can only insure that our soldiers and sailors and marines and airmen have not died in vain by resolving, as citizens of the land for which they died, that we shall not ourselves live in vain.
It is a simple matter to make war, and a difficult matter to make a peace. The history of man confirms this, for it records few periods when men have not somewhere in the world waged war on their fellow men. Confirmed in this truth, we know that our concern in America must be to move hand in hand with men of all nations to make the world safe for humanity. In this manner we can insure that those who died for us did not die in vain, that out of war has come redemption, and out of the search for redemption has come a true and just and lasting peace.
To manifest the concern of the American people for the purposes of pcacc, Congrcss by a joint resolution approved May 11, 1950, has requested the President to issue a proclamation calling upyon the people of the United States to observe each Memorial Day as a day of prayer for permanent peace and designating a period during such day when the people of the United States might unite in such supplication.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, R I C H A R D NIXON, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Memorial Day, Monday, May 31, 1971, as a day of prayer for permanent peace, and I designate the hour beginning in each locality at 11 o'clock in the morning of that day as a time to unite in such prayer.
I urge the press, radio, television, and all other information media to cooperate in this observance.
As a special mark of respect for those Americans who have given their lives in the tragic struggle in Vietnam, I direct that the flag of the United States be flown at half-staff all day on Memorial Day, instead of during the customary forenoon period, on all buildings, grounds, and naval vessels of the Federal government throughout the United States and all areas under its jurisdiction and control.
I also request the Governors of the United States and of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the appropriate officials of all local units of government to direct that the flag be flown at half-staff on all public buildings during that entire day, and request the people of the United States to display the flag at half-staff from their homes for the same period.

Despite unparalleled technological advances in many areas of our society, uncontrolled fires continue to bring a great deal of tragedy and widespread loss to our Nation. Fires now kill more than 12,000 persons each year and cause annual property losses exceeding $2 billion.
The most shameful aspect of this terrible waste is that it is so unnecessary. Most fires are caused by carelessness, by lack of knowledge, or by hazardous conditions--all of which can be eliminated. But while we all give occasional lip-service to the importance of fire prevention, our deeds too often fail to match our words--and so the loss continues.
But this pattern need not continue. If each of us will only focus his attention on the practical implications of fire prevention in his daily life, a great deal can be done to reduce the destruction caused by fires.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, RICHARD NIXON, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning October 3, 1971, as Fire Prevention Week,
I call upon all citizens to participate in the fire prevention activities of their various governments, of community fire departments, and of the National Fire Protection Association. Every person should be alert to the ways in which he can eliminate fire hazards. Every citizen should learn

how to report fires, how to use basic extinguishing agents and firefighting techniques, and how to react when major fires strike his place of work or his residence. The need to rethink all of these matters is especially important as new technologies change our living environments and the nature of the fire risks we encounter.
I also encourage all Federal agencies, in cooperation with the Federal Fire Council, to conduct effective fire prevention programs, including fire exit drills and other means of training employees, in order to help reduce this waste of life and resources which now plagues our Nation.

World Law Day, 1971

A Proclamation

june 17, 1971

From the time more than 25 centuries ago when a Hebrew prophet wrote, "The Lord is our judge . . . our lawgiver . . . our king; he will save us," Western civilization's sense of salvation has been intimately related to its vision of the universal rule of law in the affairs of men. We in the United States have special reason to cherish this vision, for the freedom, the order, and the abundance which we enjoy are fruits of its application. The great principle that the people are sovereign, and that the law they make is supreme, has operated with such signal success in our country's history that Americans are turning increasingly to the compelling logic of putting it to work in the world community as wellPeople of many other nations and cultures are doing likewise.
At the same time technology is shrinking the globe so that the sense of common destiny and common danger, the sense that "my country is the world; and my countrymen are mankind," is no longer fancy but compelling fact for the whole human race. More and more, it becomes a matter of prime importance that principle and not mere power should govern in this country called Earth.

PROCLAMATION 4061-JUNE 19, 1971

[85 STAT.

We can see many heartening evidences that law is becoming stronger and more just around the world under the pressures which reason and necessity exert. Within the nations, human rights and ecological wisdom continue to gain stature in the law. Among the nations, security and cooperation--on every front from space to the seabeds--are being enhanced through negotiations, treaties, and conventions. The United Nations is entering its second quarter of a century, and many other international organizations are working effectively through and for world law.
Also playing a constructive role are those organizations which are made up not of countries but of individual men and women, joined together in the interest of the law as citizens of their countries and of the world. One of the most important of these is the World Peace Through Law Center, founded in 1963, which this summer will hold its Fifth World Conference on World Peace Through Law at Belgrade, Yugoslavia. July 21, the date when thousands of lawyers and jurists from around the world will convene for this conference, will be observed in many nations as World Law Day--an observance in which I know the American people, a people who love the law, will want to join.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, RICHARD N I X O N , President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim July 21, 1971, as World Law Day. I call on every American to reflect that day on the sacredness of the law in American tradition. And I urge each American to join with millions of his fellow men around the world in heightened recognition of the importance of the rule of law in international affairs to our goal of a stable peace.

By the President of the United States of America

juiy i, 1971

A Proclamation

In our highly mobile society where city streets are jammed with motor vehicles, a number of safeguards such as traffic lights, "Walk" signs, and hatched crosswalks have been introduced to promote pedestrian safety. In the world of the blind and visually handicapped this same purpose is served by a single small device, often weighing less than half a pound. It is the white cane.
For its owner the white cane is at once a sensor and a guide, and even as it denotes his physical limitation it speaks eloquently for his capability.

[85 STAT.

Training programs instituted throughout the Nation in recent years have developed travel techniques for white cane users that instill self-confidence and a sense of independence. As a result, the white cane has become a symbol of achievement--the achievement of its owner in learning to cope with his environment and to move readily on his way.
But this new mobility cannot be fully realized without the cooperation of fellow pedestrians and the willingness of motorists to give way. An understanding of the potential dangers which city streets hold for blind citizens is commendable, but adequate protection for them can be provided only by strict observance of safety measures.
Our recognition of the white cane and its significance must be immediate; and our reaction equally as rapid. It takes only a second for a motorist to accept second place, but that instant's inhibition may save a life. There is no better time to be our brother's keeper.
To make our people more fully aware of the significance of the white cane, and of the need for motorists to exercise caution and courtesy when approaching persons carrying a white cane, the Congress, by joint resolution, approved October 6, 1964 (78 Stat. 1003), has authorized the President to proclaim October 15 of each year as White Cane Safety Day.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, RICHARD NIXON, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim October 15, 1971 as White Cane Safety Day.
I call upon all our citizens to join individually in this observance, that blind persons in our society may continue to enjoy the greatest possible measure of personal independence.
IN WITNESS W H E R E O F , I have hereunto set my hand this first day of July in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-fifth.

National Star Route Mail Carriers Week
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

In 1845 Congress provided that future mail transportation contracts were to be awarded by the Postmaster General "to the loyvest bidder,

85 STAT. ]

PROCLAMATION 4063-JULY 1, 1971

915

tendering sufficient guarantees for faithful performance, without other reference to the mode of such transportation than may be necessary to provide for the due celerity, certainty, and security of such transportation."
That statute not only opened a colorful chapter in American postal service, but also set forth a bold new standard for transportation of the mails: "Celerity, Certainty, and Security," Bids from private contractors under the 1845 law were soon marked on the books of the Post Office Department with three stars, signifying the three points of that motto. Over time, the bids themselves became known as "star bids," and eventually the contract service for transporting the mail by all modes, except boats and railways, came to be known as "star route mail service,"
Since the inception of this service 126 years ago, star route carriers have performed an important task for the American people, transporting the mail over thousands of miles of roads where regular postal service was unavailable. In recent years, the star route carriers have also made an important contribution to rural America, often supplementing the efforts of the regular carriers.
In recognition of the dedicated public service of our star route carriers, the Congress, by House Joint Resolution 583, has requested the President to issue a proclamation designating the last full week in July of 1971 as National Star Route Mail Carriers Week,
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, RICHARD NIXON, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning July 25, 1971, as National Star Route Mail Carriers Week,
I urge the Postal Service, and all interested groups and organizations, to observe that week with appropriate recognition to the Nation's star route mail carriers.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of July, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-fifth.

Display of Flags at the Washington Monument
By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

36 u s e 173 et seq.

The Washington Monument stands day and night as America's tribute to our first President. The fifty American flags that encircle the base of the Monument represent our fifty States and, at the same time, symbolize our enduring Federal Union.
As this Nation's 200th year approaches, I believe that it would do all Americans well to remember the years of our first President and to recall the enduring ideals of our Nation.
As an expression of our rededication to the ideals of America and in accordance with the joint resolution of Congress of June 22, 1942 (56 Stat. 377), as amended by the joint resolution of December 22, 1942, (56 Stat. 1074), which permits the flag to be displayed at night "upon special occasions when it is desired to produce a patriotic effect," it is appropriate that our national colors henceforth be displayed day and night at the Washington Monument.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, R I C H A R D NIXON, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim that, effective July 4, 1971, the fifty flags of the United States of America displayed at the Washington Monument in the District of Columbia be flown at all times during the day and night, except when the weather is inclement.
The rules and customs pertaining to the display of the flag as set forth in the joint resolution of June 22, 1942, as amended, are hereby modified accordingly.
IN WITNESS W H E R E O F , I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of July, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-sixth.

From its beginnings as a nation, the United States has maintained a commitment to the principles of national independence and human liberty. In keeping with this tradition, it remains an essential purpose of our people to encourage the constructive changes which lead to the growth of human freedom. We understand and sympathize with the efforts of oppressed j>eoples everywhere to realize this inalienable right.

^^ ^'^'- ^^^-

PROCLAMATION 4066-JULY 9, 1971

[85 STAT.

the United Nations completes its twenty-sixth year of service to the world, United Nations Day is an occasion to look back with gratitude and a measure of pride, and to look ahead with determination and hope.
Reviewing the work of the United Nations since 1945, we can see a substantial record of accomplishment in the world body's major areas of endeavor--"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war . . . and to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom," as the Charter states them. The United States will continue in the future, as it has in the past, to support the efforts of the U N in these great tasks.
At the same time, this country and its fellow member countries of the UN must act together to meet the new problems this new decade thrusts upon us. Through the UN, we all share stewardship over the planet Earth: together we face the challenges of coordinating measures to heal and protect the world's fragile ecosystems; of ensuring that the resources of the sea are developed for the benefit of all mankind; of promoting international cooperation in the use of outer space. Through the UN, we all share responsibility for making the human community more humane: together we face the challenges of curbing such vicious international crimes as narcotics trafficking, air piracy, and terrorism against diplomats; of moderating explosive population growth; of protecting the human rights of prisoners of war and refugees.
The roots of American commitment to the United Nations go far deeper than the words of a charter signed at San Francisco or the glass and steel of a headquarters in New York--they spring from the hearts of the American people. With the world in urgent need of a dynamic, effective international organization, it is appropriate for us as a people and as individuals to renew our sense of tough-minded dedication to making the U N work. The President's Commission for the Observance of the Twenty-fifth Anniversary of the United Nations, under the chairmanship of Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge, recently submitted to me its recommendations for measures to increase the effectiveness of the United Nations and of American participation therein. I am giving this useful report close study, and I commend it to the attention of every concerned citizen. Only "we the peoples of the United Nations," who ordained the UN Charter and charged it with man's highest hopes, have the power to make it succeed.

NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, R I C H A R D NIXON, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Sunday, October 24, 1971, as United Nations Day. I urge the citizens of this Nation to observe that day with community programs which will express realistic understanding and support for the United Nations and its associated organizations.

National Moon Walk Day
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
The United States has special reason to remember July 20, 1969, with pride, for it was on this date that two of our Apollo 11 astronauts, Neil A. Armstrong and Edwin E. Aldrin, Jr., landed on the moon. Armstrong's message, "The Eagle has landed," marked the achievement of what men had dreamed of over the centuries: to navigate through space and land on another celestial body. Soon after their landing at the Sea of Tranquility, both astronauts walked on the surface of the moon, placed an American flag on its soil, gathered samples of soil and rocks, and emplaced scientific recording equipment. Man's exploration of the moon had begun.
Since the historic flight of Apollo 11, American astronauts have extended man's exploration of the moon to the Ocean of Storms with Apollo 12 and the hills of Frau Mauro with Apollo 14, with rich scientific return. Next week, Apollo 15 is scheduled to head for another different region of the moon to explore the base of the 12,000-foot Apennine Mountains and the rim of the 1,300 foot canyon-like Hadley Rille. Thus, two years after the first landing on the moon, other brave men are following in the footsteps of Armstrong and Aldrin to explore the unknown and advance scientific knowledge for the benefit of all mankind.
To commemorate the anniversary of the first moon walk on July 20, 1969, and to accord recognition to the many achievements of the national space program, the Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 101, has requested that the President issue a proclamation designating July 20, 1971, as National Moon Walk Day.

Fisheries Centennial Year

A Proclamation

16 Stat. 593.

Just one hundred years ago, on February 9, 1871, the Congress of the United States authorized the President to appoint the first Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries. Shortly thereafter, President Grant named Professor Spencer Fullerton Baird to this post and in June, 1871, Professor Baird initiated a program of research concerning the conservation of fish at Woods Hole, Massachusetts. From that original effort has evolved both the National Marine Fisheries Service of the Commerce Department's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife.
The efforts to conserve and improve America's fisheries are vitally important to all of our people. These efforts will require the continuing vigilance of the fishing industry, of government at all levels, of private conservationists and of the American public.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, RICHARD N I X O N , President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the year 1971 as Fisheries Centennial Year. I urge all citizens to support and encourage the work of Federal and State administrators and scientists and the work of private conservation organizations in protecting and enhancing the fisheries of our Nation.

General Pulaski's Memorial Day, 1971

juiy 26,1971

The one hundred and ninety-second anniversary of the death of General Casimir Pulaski on October 11, 1779, in the battle of Savannah, reminds us of the great sacrifice he made for our national independence.
General Pulaski believed that the cause of human freedom was indivisible. He fought against foreign suppression in his native Poland and he joined the struggle for American independence by volunteering in the Continental Army.
On this anniversary of General Pulaski's death, it is appropriate that we note with gratitude his historic contribution--and that of succeeding generations of Americans of Polish origin--to the freedom and progress of this Nation.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, RICHARD NIXON, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Monday, October 11, 1971, as General Pulaski's Memorial Day. I direct the appropriate Government officials to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on that day.
I also invite the people of the United States to observe that day with appropriate ceremonies honoring the memory of General Pulaski and the contributions which he and others from his homeland have made to our national life.

American Trial Lawyers Week

By f^g President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Ante, p. 163.

The idea of a fair trial, a legal scholar has observed, "has been the greatest contribution made to civilization by our Anglo-American polity." For twenty-five years, the members of the American Trial Lawyers Association have sought to translate this noble inspiration into an everyday reality for those whose disputes and grievances must be settled in a court of law.
Through the adversary process, these lawyers have now established a long and proud tradition and have shown that the methods and values of the trial advocate may serve as a model for the just resolution of disputes among men. Their continuing commitment to fair and orderly trials has become an essential part of the administration of justice in America.
In honor of the American Trial Lawyers Association on the occasion of its twenty-fifth anniversary, the Congress, by House Joint Resolution 714, has designated the week beginning August 1, 1971, as American Trial Lawyers Week and has requested the President to encourage appropriate observance of that week.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, RICHARD NIXON, President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon each American, during American Trial Lawyers Week, to renew his commitment to enhance the administration of justice for the public good; and I direct the appropriate Government officials to display the flag of the United States on all public buildings on Monday, August 2, 1971.

National Clown Week
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

923 August 2,1971

Whoever has heard the laughter of a child or seen sudden delight on the face of a lonely old man has understood in those brief moments mysteries deeper than love.
All men are indebted to those who bring such moments of quiet splendor--who redeem sickness and pain with joy. All across America, good men in putty noses and baggy trousers, following a tradition as old as man's need to touch gently the lives of his fellowman, go into orphanages and children's hospitals, homes for the elderly and for the retarded, and give a part of themselves. Today, as always, clowns and the spirit they represent are as vital to the maintenance of our humanity as the builders and the growers and the governors.
In the folklore of the world is the persistent claim that the heart of a clown is sad, and that all the gladness he provokes is simply a facade for the pain he cannot reveal to the world. In the myth is the kernel of reason: the clown leaves happiness where he goes, and takes misery away with him.
Yet, we cannot suppose there is real truth in the myth. For surely the laugh-makers are blessed: they heal the heart of the world.
To call public attention to the charitable activities of clowns and the wholesome entertainment they provide for all our citizens, the Congress by a joint resolution approved October 8, 1970 (Public Law 91-433), has requested the President to designate the week of August 1 through August 7, 1971, as National Clown Week.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, R I C H A R D N I X O N , President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week of August 1 through August 7, 1971, as National Clown Week. I invite the Governors of the States and the appropriate officials of other areas under the United States flag to issue similar proclamations.
I urge the people of the United States to recognize the contributions made by clowns in their entertainment at children's hospitals, charitable institutions, institutions for the mentally retarded, and generally helping to lift the spirits and boost the morale of our people.

National Highway Week, 1971

ffig President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

When the Erie Canal opened in 1825 it quickly acquired the slogan "A Cent and a Half a Mile, a Mile and a Half an Hour." Our toll roads now cost the traveller nearly the same amount, but the trip from New York to Buffalo that once took five days by barge at a mile and a half per hour now takes less than ten hours by automobile and can be travelled at 65 miles per hour.
The highways built since the Erie Canal have become the dominant element in our national transportation system and a key fo^ce in virtually every phase of modern American life. These roads not only provide avenues of commerce for our nation's economy, but also help to make available the services and pleasures of our daily existence. Our rapidly developing 42,500 mile System of Interstate and Defense Highway is especially helpful for the traveller who wishes to visit recreational areas and historic sites that previously were known only through photographs.
In our present day, by serving as the conduit for a large proportion of mass transit in urban areas, highways go far toward meeting our needs for the best possible transportation. In the future, as a part of a balanced system of growth, they should be a key part of an integrated and comprehensive transportation plan for these urban areas, linking other vital means of transportation by air, rail and water. In this proliferation of American highways we find a clear reflection of the good which men can do by planning and working together in common needs.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, RICHARD NIXON, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning September 19, 1971, as National Highway Week. I urge Federal, State, and local government officials, as well as highway industry and other organizations, to hold appropriate ceremonies during that week in recognition of what highway transportation means to our country.

National Employ The Handicapped Week, 1971
By the President of the United States of America

August 13,1971

A Proclamation

From Beethoven, who could not hear but gave the world magnificent symphonies, to Franklin Roosevelt, who could not walk but led America through giant strides in peace and war, history is full of proof that the whole of human potential is far greater than the sum of its physical parts--limbs or organs, or faculties.
It was in recognition of this truth, and of the Hebrew wisdom that "the best alms are . . . to enable a man to dispense with alms," that the President's Committee on Employment of the Handicapped was established 24 years ago. For nearly a quarter century now, business, government, and the public have worked together as partners in this Committee--to open a newly self-reliant and fulfilling way of life for many thousands of handicapped men and women, and to unlock for the rest of us the benefits of the unique contribution each handicapped person has to make. Through such efforts, American society is learning that no handicap is insurmountable when a man has an unlimited view of himself and an ounce of help from his fellows.
This is a record to be proud of--and to build on still more energetically. Our responsibility to help provide training, jobs, and real opportunity for those who are handicapped as a result of accidents, birth defects, or disease, is a continuing challenge. In addition, we bear today the special trust of redeeming the sacrifices of our disabled veterans of the Vietnam era by giving them the very best in rehabilitation and employment assistance.

PROCLAMATION 4075
Year of World Minority Language Groups
By The President of The United States of America

929 August i?, 1971

A Proclamation

Among the people of today's world, there are more than two thousand distinct vernacular tongues without an alphabet or written form. Millions of people remain in cultural and linguistic isolation, unable to experience the benefits of modern civilization or to become full participants in the world community.
Thousands of skilled linguists of diverse nationalities are working in some of the most remote areas of the world in cooperation with foreign governments and institutions of higher learning. Living with a single tribe or ethnic grouping, for years in some cases, the linguistic scholar must gradually gain the confidence of a people. He immerses himself in the culture and learns their patterns of thought and styles of expression. Only then can the pioneer of literacy begin to produce an alphabet and to undertake a thorough grammatical analysis of the language. Out of these efforts comes basic literacy, and the end of isolation.
The Congress, by a joint resolution approved August 16, 1971, has requested the President to issue a proclamation calling on the people of the United States to recognize the international effort to provide written languages for minority language groups, and designating 1971 as the "Year of World Minority Language Groups".
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, R I C H A R D N I X O N , President of the United States of America, do hereby designate 1971 the Year of World Minority Language Groups.
I urge Americans to honor those dedicated linguists who work throughout the world for literacy, and I invite foreign governments, the governments of our States and communities, and all people to observe the year by continuing appropriate scientific and educational activities.
IN WITNESS W H E R E O F , I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of August in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-one; and of the Independence of the United States of America, the one hundred ninety-sixth.

1. This subpart contains temporary modifications of the provisions of the tariff schedules (other than modifications for balance of payments purposes) proclaimed by the President pursuant to his authority to modify duties as required or appropriate to carry out trade agreements (section 3 5 0 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, and section 2 0 1 ( a ) ( 2 ) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962) and/or pursuant to his authority to terminate proclamations in part (section 350(a) (6) and section 255(b) of such acts, respectively). The rates of duty provided for in this subpart apply only with respect to articles entered during the period specified in the last column.
2. Stainless Steel Flatware Tariff-Rate Quota.--
(a) The tariff-rate quota with respect to knives, forks and spoons with stainless steel handles, valued under 25 cents each and not over 10.2 inches in over-all length, provided for in items 949.00 through 949.08, was established by the President pursuant to section 3 5 0 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ) and ( a ) ( 6 ) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, and sections 2 0 1 ( a ) ( 2 ) and 255(b) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.
(b) The tariff rate quota-- (i) shall be allocated among sources of supply and administered on a calendar quarter basis; (ii) may be increased for each calendar quarter in any calendar year commencing with the calendar year 1972, by an increase in the quarterly allocations over the allocations for the last quarter of the immediately preceding calendar year by the percentage (not in excess of 6 percent) which the President determines is the percentage increase in United States consumption of knives, forks and spoons with stainless steel handles during such preceding calendar year over the next preceding calendar year, unless economic conditions in the United States industry producing such articles indicate that a smaller growth rate or no growth rate is warranted; notice of any such increase shall be given by the President to the Secretary of the Treasury and published in the Federal Register; any such increase shall take effect on the first day of the calendar quarter next succeeding the date of such publication and shall remain in effect until further increased under this subparagraph;
(iii) shall be administered so that if any quantity of a product of a particular source of supply which is permitted to be entered within the tariff-rate quota during any calendar quarter is not entered, the difference between the allocation to such source for such quarter and the quantity which was entered and charged against the quota from such source, or 10 percent of such allocation, whichever is the lesser, may be entered during the immediately following calendar quarter; provided that any increased quantity permitted under this subparagraph shall not be considered part of such source's allocation for any quarter;
(iv) shall be administered so that if it becomes effective, or is increased, after the beginning of a calendar quarter, the quantity entitled to enter, or the amount of the increase which may be entered, during the unexpired portion of such quarter as originating from each source of supply shall be the quantity as so effective, or the amount of the increase, for such calendar quarter, less 1/90 thereof for each day that has expired in such quarter;
(v) shall be administered so that each single unit entered in a set shall be counted in determining the number of units entered during any calendar quarter.
(c) As promptly as practicable in each calendar year (beginning with 1972), the Tariff Commission shall determine the apparent United States consumption of knives, forks and spoons with stainless steel handles during the preceding calendar year and shall report such determination to the President. In its first report, the Commission shall also determine the apparent United States consumption of such articles during the calendar year 1970.

The Constitution of the United States, as Woodrow Wilson observed early in this century, "is not a mere lawyers' document: it is a vehicle of life, and its spirit is always the spirit of the age."

To each new generation of American citizens, this lesson comes afresh. To the young of today, it has come dramatically this year with the passage of the Twenty-Sixth Amendment, granting full voting rights to those between 18 and 21 years of age.

As citizens of all ages join in welcoming these young people into the electorate, we can also unite with them in recognizing that our Constitution does have a special relevance for every age. Enduring and timeless, yet it is vital and Hfe-giving, affirming as no other written document can that the ideals upon which men acted in the early days of our Republic are as essential now as they were then.

From the earliest explorations of the New World, men and women of Hispanic origin and descent have contributed significantly to the development of our American nationality. The geographic .names of our country fully attest to that contribution. In fact, the oldest city in the United States, St. Augustine, Florida, was founded by Spanish explorers in 1565--406 years ago.

Our Hispanic heritage touches our everyday lives as well--our music, our architecture, our currency, and our cuisine.

Americans of Hispanic origin and descent have served our country with distinction throughout our State, local, and national governments--and continue to do so today.
In the past, men and women of Hispanic origin and descent helped to discover, develop, and people this land. We are fortunate that today they are our own people.

Drug Abuse Prevention Week, 1971
By the ?resident of the United States of America

A Proclamation

"What shall it profit a man," the Bible asks, "if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?" It is a question which the menace of drug abuse poses anew to all of us.
What can a nation profit from its abundant good life, if the same technology and material wealth which have yielded that abundance permits millions of its people, particularly its youth, to drift into the chemical

85 STAT.]

PROCLAMATION 4080-SEPT. 17, 1971

modification of mind and mood at grave risk to their health--to their very lives? What can a nation profit from its unparalleled individual freedom, if that liberty becomes license and that license leads to drug dependence which controls the bodies and warps the minds of men, women, children, and even the unborn?
Not so long ago it was easy enough to regard the tragedy of drug abuse as "someone else's problem." But recent years have brought that tragedy home--often very literally--to all Americans. We have learned that "drug abuse" refers not only to the crime-prone heroin addict-- though that is the disease at its deadliest, with over 1,000 heroin fatalities rmnually in New York City. The term also refers to the suburban housewife dependent on tranquilizers or diet pills; to the truck driver overreliant on pep pills; to the student leaning on amphetamines to help him cram for exams; even to pre-teens sniffing glue.
It has become a problem that touches each of us. Its manifestations are many and varied, but all grow from a common root--psychological and physical needs unmet through legitimate social channels--and all feed on a common ignorance--ignorance of the profound harm the abuser does to himself and society. Drug abuse is nothing less than a life and death matter for countless Americans, and for the moral fiber of this Nation. The drive to meet this threat must command from us our very best--our attention, our energies, our resources and our prayers.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, RICHARD N I X O N , President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning October 3, 1971, as the second annual Drug Abuse Prevention Week.
I call upon officials of the Federal Government under the leadership of the new Special Action Office for Drug Abuse Prevention, particularly those officials in the Departments of Health, Education and Welfare, Justice, and Defense, to join with educators and the medical profession in intensifying programs to prevent and reduce drug abuse among the young and among all Americans. I urge State and local governments, as well as business and civic groups, to cooperate in such programs and to seek out new methods by which the risks and dangers of drug experimentation can be communicated to the entire Nation. The communications media can render invaluable assistance in this endeavor, and I urge them to do so.
I also encourage the clergy, and all of our moral and spiritual leaders, to make a special effort during this week to take up the problem of drug abuse and to offer those answers of the spirit which alone can fill the void where drug abuse begins.
And I appeal, above all, to those who bear the special trusts of parenthood--that all of us may rededicate ourselves to the well-being of America's youth; and that we may so teach them, so guide them, so reach out to them in understanding and compassion, as to help them

A Proclamation

Nearly a thousand years ago Leif Erikson, a bold and intrepid Norseman, left familiar waters with a small band of men to face the dangers of the North Atlantic and sail to the shores of this continent. The exploits of Leif Erikson are still in large part shrouded in the mists of history, and only now are we beginning to appreciate fully the magnitude of those explorations.
If the details of Leif Erikson's adventures are still hidden from our view, his courage is not. He and his shipmates are worthy guides to us today, and our journey into the unknown still draws inspiration from them. It is therefore most appropriate that we give national recognition to Leif Erikson, and I am most happy to meet the request of the Congress of the United States, in a joint resolution approved September 2, 1964 (78 Stat. 849), that the President proclaim October 9 in each year as Leif Erikson Day.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, R I C H A R D N I X O N , President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Saturday, October 9, 1971, as Leif Erikson Day; and I direct the appropriate Government officials to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings that day.

September 23,1971

A Proclamation

The strength and energy of a society may be measured today and predicted for tomorrow by the health of its children. Robust bodies, bright eyes, sharp minds: all of these define the quality of life in this country now and for the future.

Caring for the health of our 70 million citizens under eighteen and the nearly four million babies bom each year is not merely a choice for today, but also a duty to tomorrow.

All our children deserve to be free from preventable sickness and handicaps. If they suffer illness or handicap, they should have the best care possible.

We need to insure that parents are helped to bear healthy babies; that infants receive optimal care; that the health of the children is protected and enhanced during the growing years; that abnormalities of development are prevented or ameliorated.

A Proclamation

There are no persons more deeply devoted to peace than those who have directly experienced the horrors of war. And there is no group of Americans who have done more to prepare the way for lasting peace than those who have actively resisted the forces of aggression and tyranny as members of our Armed Forces.
Veterans Day, 1971, afTords us a special opportunity to pay tribute to our Nation's veterans, and to express our gratitude and acknowledge our debt for all they have given to their country. But our observance of Veterans Day must not stop there. For we honor their devotion best when we renew our own devotion to their ideals: to courage and selflessness and loyalty and honor--and, above all, to lasting peace.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, RICHARD NIXON, President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon all Americans to join in commemorating Monday, October 25, 1971, as Veterans Day. I ask that all Americans join with me in paying tribute on that day to all those who have served this country as members of its Armed Forces in the past and to all those who are performing such service at home and abroad at this hour.
As a mark of our respect for these men and women, I direct the appropriate officials of the Government to arrange for the display of the flag of the United States on all public buildings on Veterans Day and I request all Government officials to cooperate with civic and patriotic organizations in conducting appropriate public ceremonies throughout the land.

125th Anniversary of the Smithsonian Institution

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation

September 24, 1971

Since 1846, the Smithsonian Institution has admirably fulfilled the stipulations of John Smithson's bequest--"to found * * * an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men." The Smithsonian has pioneered and promoted this country's activities in fields as diverse as meteorology and art collecting, anthropology and aeronautics, ecology and educational experimentation. In the best American tradition it has served as a mecca of hospitality to the scientists and scholars of the world.

As a tribute to the Smithsonian Institution, the Congress, by House Joint Resolution 782, has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation announcing the celebration of the one hundred and twenty-fifth anniversary of the Institution and designating September 26, 1971, as a special day to honor its scientific and cultural achievements.

National Newspaperboy Day, 1971

September 30,1971

J5y the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

This day affords an opportunity to pay tribute to the one million American newspaperboys--who every day travel more than a million miles and distribute more than 62 miUion newspapers, by their diUgence earning some $600 million each year for themselves and, in many cases, as a help to their families.
Besides developing sound work habits, these young businessmen-- chiefly between the ages of 12 and 15--learn early how to be contributing members of society, acquiring habits of independence and punctuality and a sense of responsibility. Newspaperboys are seldom delinquents. They are busy, and busy boys have neither the time nor the inclination to get into trouble. They are good citizens.
The roster of former newspaperboys reads like a Who's Who of successful businessmen, statesmen, government officials, performing artists, clergymen, doctors and lawyers. A partial listing includes Ralph Bunche, Tom C. Clark, Bing Crosby, Bob Considine, Richard Cardinal Cushing, Jack Dempsey, Jimmy Durante, Dwight Eisenhower, Ernie Ford, John Glenn, Herbert Hoover, J. Edgar Hoover, Bob Hope, John W. McCormack, Charles Percy, David Sarnoff, Alan Shepard, Red Skelton, Ed Sullivan and John Wayne.
Without newspaperboys, freedom of the press would be more an ideal than a reality. Since the newspaperboy is the actual link between publisher and reader, he gives practical expression to this basic American right.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, RICHARD NIXON, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Saturday, October 16, 1971, as National Newspaperboy Day. I urge the citizens of this Nation to honor American newspaperboys for their significant contribution to the civic, social and economic good of the United States.

National Day of Prayer, 1971

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The great need of our time is that of reconcihation. Nations should be reconciled to nations, races to races, families to families, individuals to individuals. Reconciliation is needed among communities, among ethnic groups, among religious denominations, among social and economic classes, among family members.
The work of reconciliation is too great to be left to man alone. In this work, man needs God, the Supreme Reconciler. The Bible tells us God is the source of reconciliation, in Whom all things are one. Under the fatherhood of God, there flourishes the brotherhood of man.
The world yearns for reconciliation, and for the renewal and the solidarity and the healing that reconciliation brings. This hunger can only be met in its fullness through prayer.
In 1952 the Congress directed the President to set aside a suitable day other than a Sunday each year as a National Day of Prayer. On this day we give special recognition to the Nation's deep religious heritage, and we ask God's help and His blessing.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, R I C H A R D NIXON, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Wednesday, October 20, as National Day of Prayer, 1971. On this day I urge that Americans pray for the fullness of reconciliation among all peoples, and for progress toward ending divisiveness in our own land and in the international community. Let us especially pray for reconciliation in Southeast Asia, and for a speedy return to their loved ones of our long-suffering prisoners of war.

A Proclamation

947 October u , 1971

Today, we are acutely aware of the scarcity of our Nation's vital resources. Some have been lost irretrievably, but others, including products from forests, lend themselves to long-term management.

As our country has grown, it has become increasingly dependent on our forest resources for shelter, furnishings, paper and many other products essential to our way of life. But only now are we beginning to truly appreciate the importance of forests for maintaining a balanced ecology. We must make effective use and management of our forests with due regard for the environment so that we will strengthen our rural economy as well as provide aesthetic and recreational benefits for our people.

The Congress, in order to emphasize the importance of forest resources and forest products to the Nation, has by a joint resolution of September 13, 1960 (74 Stat. 898) designated the seven-day period beginning on the third Sunday of October in each year as National Forest Products Week, and has requested the President to issue an annual proclamation calling for the observance of that week.

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

From 1923, when Fiddlin' John Carson made the first tremendously successful country recording until today when country sounds can be heard on over 700 radio stations, the popularity of country music has been a notable part of our American culture.
Why is country music so popular? Why is the Grand Ole Opry's audience made up of people who have traveled an estimated average of 450 miles one way to be there?
The answer is simple. Country music speaks to what is tried and true for many Americans. It speaks of the common things shared by all: the happiness of a family, the pains of a broken heart, the mercy of God, and the goodness of man.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, RICHARD NIXON, President of the United States of America, ask the people of this Nation to mark the month of October, 1971, with suitable observances as Country Music Month.

What has been a characteristic of our history is even more dominant in our Hves today. A system of education that has conferred inestimable benefits upon generation after generation of American citizens--that has contributed in large measure to the spirit and character of the American nation itself--continues to bring reality to the ideals of freedom, serving our people with the same dedication that it has always displayed and with an ever greater measure of efTectiveness.
Yet it must be acknowledged that the challenge to our educational system is not diminishing, but mounting. For we recognize that our success in meeting unprecedented social, scientific, and physical change, and in directing its forces to positive ends, will be determined essentially by the quality of our schools, colleges, and universities, by the wisdom with which we develop and employ new educational techniques and technologies, and above all, by the compassion and understanding with which we reach out to all people--especially the young--and impart to each the intellectual and occupational enrichment which every American deserves.
After a period of uncertainty in educational matters, we are surer now of how that challenge shall be met. Our country is moving purposefully and efTectively to strengthen and develop the great partnership of interests--Federal, State, local and private--through which we can accomplish our educational aims. Our educational leaders are not acting independently but with a new sense of cooperative unity, determined to use all resources, explore all initiatives, and recast the laws, if necessary, in order to serve our national needs. This is not an easy task, and if we are to succeed, we must call upon the assistance and support of all the American people.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, RICHARD NIXON, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the period of October 24 through October 30, 1971 as American Education Week.
I urge all my fellow Americans to make known during this week their appreciation for the truly heroic efforts of our teachers and all our education professionals upon whose humane skills so much of our greatness as a people depends. I ask moreover that we focus upon education as the central task of a democracy and the indispensable ally of liberty. Let the clarity of our vision and the boldness of our actions match the magnitude of our cause.

A Proclamation
Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. once said: "I think that, as life is action and passion, it is required of a man that he should share the passion and action of his time at peril of being judged not to have lived."
We can be proud of the extent to which our young men and women today are playing an active role in the continuing growth of our Nation. In organizations as diverse as student governments, vocational education, civic, social, business, religious and social action groups, these young citizens are learning the ideals of America by putting them into practice.
Hard work, cooperation, patriotism, and individual excellence--all of these come to be cherished by those who participate constructively in this building of America. And often this learning has expanded the ideals and conscience of America, refreshing our spirit.
As we move into the third century of our republic, the mantle of responsibility and leadership will be passed to this generation of Americans. I am convinced that the youth of today will wear that mantle proudly, carry out the responsibilities of adulthood and leadership with conviction and concern for their fellow man, and reflect great credit on their country.
In recognition of the national resource America's youth represents, and to promote greater understanding between our generations, the Congress by a joint resolution approved July 2, 1971 (Public Law 92-43), designated the seven-day period beginning November 8, 1971, as Youth Appreciation Week, and requested the President to issue a proclamation calling for the observance of that week.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, R I C H A R D NIXON, President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon the people of the United States to observe the week of November 8 through November 14, 1971, as Youth Appreciation Week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.

A Proclamation

The Director of the Office of Emergency Preparedness, with the advice of the Oil Pohcy Committee, has found that the national security will not be adversely affected by changes in the oil import program which would

--extend indefinitely the provision permitting the importation of No. 2 fuel oil into District I,

--enable holders of allocations made pursuant to this program to obtain No. 2 fuel oil manufactured in Puerto Rico, and

--authorize the suspension, from time to time, of the requirement that such No. 2 fuel oil be manufactured in the Western Hemisphere from crude oil produced in that hemisphere.

The Director, with the advice of the Oil Policy Committee, has recommended that Proclamation No. 3279 , as amended, be further
,, ' amended to adjust imports and to improve the administration of the program in conformity with these findings.
I agree with the findings and recommendations of the Director and deem it necessary and consistent with the security objectives of Proclamation No. 3279, as amended, to adjust the imports of petroleum and petroleum products, and to improve the administration of the program, as hereinafter provided.

^^j^t, cffcctive as of the date of this Proclamation, Proclamation No. 3279, as amended, is further amended as follows:
^ Subparagraph (1) of paragraph (a) of section 2 is amended to read as follows:
"Except as otherwise provided in this proclamation, the maximum level of imports (exclusive of imports from Canada provided for in paragraph (a) of section l A ) , subject to allocation, of crude oil, unfinished oils, and finished products (other than residual fuel oil to be used as fuel) into Districts I - I V for a particular allocation period, shall be an amount equal to the difference between (i) 960,000 barrels per day during that allocation period and (ii) the quantity of crude oil and unfinished oils which may be imported pursuant to paragraph (h) of section lA of this proclamation during the particular allocation period plus the quantity estimated by the Secretary by which shipments of unfinished oils and finished products (other than residual fuel oil to be used as fuel) from Puerto Rico to Districts I - I V during that allocation period will exceed the quantity (as adjusted by the Secretary as he may determine to be consonant with the objectives of this proclamation) so shipped during a comparable base period in the year 1965. Within this maximum level, imports of unfinished oils and imports of finished products (other than residual fuel oil to be used as fuel) shall not exceed such levels as the Secretary may determine to be consonant with the objectives of this proclamation. In addition to the imports permitted under the first sentence of this paragraph, for the period January 1, 1971 through December 31, 1971, and for each allocation period thereafter, there may be imported into District I, an average of 45,000 barrels per day of No. 2 fuel oil, manufactured in the Western Hemisphere from crude oil produced in the Western Hemisphere, for allocation, under regulations of the Secretary, to persons in the business in District I of selling No. 2 fuel oil who do not have crude oil import allocations into Districts I - I V and who operate deep water terminals in District I or have through-put agreements with deep water terminal operators in District I who do not have crude oil import allocations into Districts I-IV, on a fair and equitable basis, to the extent possible, in relation to such persons' inputs of No. 2 fuel oil to such terminals, having regard to any product import allocations into Districts I-IV made to such persons. No person who manufactures in Puerto Rico No. 2 fuel oil from crude oil produced in the Western Hemisphere shall incur a reduction of an allocation or be deemed to have violated a condition of an allocation by reason of a shipment of such oil to a person who holds an allocation under the preceding sentence and who relinquishes an amount of

the allocation equal to the amount so shipped, so long as the total of all such shipments from Puerto Rico during a particular allocation period does not exceed an average of 5,000 barrels per day. Whenever the Director of the Office of Emergency Preparedness, as a result of his surveillance under paragraph (a) of section 6, finds that because of supply, price or other considerations, the requirement that such No. 2 fuel oil be manufactured and produced in the Western Hemisphere is restricting the availability of such oil for importation into District I and is not required for the national security, he shall so advise the Secretary who may then suspend such requirement by appropriate regulation. No such suspension shall be renewed except upon a new finding by the Director of the Office of Emergency Preparedness as required under the preceding sentence. The Secretary may, by regulation, provide thai a holder of an allocation for the importation of No. 2 fuel oil under the provisions of this subparagraph may import crude oil produced in the Western Hemisphere in lieu of No. 2 fuel oil, barrel for barrel, and exchange such crude oil for No. 2 fuel oil."

November 5, 1971

One of the splendid events which shape man's destiny occurred when a small band of people, believing in the essential sanctity of their own being, went in search of a land in which their individuality might be the highest national value, before any arbitrary limitation or duty placed upon some men by the whim or design of others.
They went in search of a land where they might live out their own commitment to their own ideal of human freedom. In the purpose of their search, the human spirit found its ultimate definition, and in the product of their search, its ultimate expression. They found the land they sought, and it was a difficult land, but it was rich. With their sacrifices they brought forth its riches, and laid the foundation for a new nation.

But more than that, they revealed a new possibility for the expression of man's spirit. In the sure unfolding of that possibility man has begun to experience a world in which he may do justice, love mercy and walk humbly with his God forever.
For what those early settlers established, we give thanks in a way which began with them. In their first years on the hard cold edge of man's bright golden dream, they were tried and their faith was tested. But when their bodies failed, their faith did not.
The stark simple words on a sarcophagus in a little village on the seacoast of Massachusetts tell the story well: "This monument marks the first burying-ground in Plymouth of the passengers of the Mayflower. Here, under cover of darkness, the fast dwindling company laid their dead; leveling the earth above them lest the Indians should learn howmany were the graves."
Yet, because mankind was not created merely to survive, in the face of all hardship and suffering, these men and women--and those of the other early settlements--prevailed. And the settlers gathered to give thanks for God's bounty, for the blessings of life itself, and for the freedom which they so cherished that no hardship could quench it. And now their heritage is ours.
What they dared to imagine for this land came to pass.
What they planted here prospered.
And for our heritage--a land rich with the bountiful blessings of God, and the freedom to enjoy those rich blessings--we give thanks to God Almighty in this time, and for all time.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, RICHARD NIXON, President of the United States of America, in accordance with the wish of the Congress ^s cxprcsscd in Section 6103 of Title 5 of the United States Code, do hereby proclaim Thursday, November 25, 1971, as a day of national thanksgiving. I call upon all Americans to share this day, to give thanks in homes and in places of worship for the many blessings our people enjoy, to welcome the elderly and less fortunate as special participants in this day's festivities and observances, thereby truly showing our gratitude to God by expressing and reflecting His love.

More than at any time in our history, it is apparent that the quality of Hfe in America tomorrow will greatly depend upon balanced growth in our Nation today.
The flourishing of agriculture upon our shores has been one of the greatest success stories in the history of man, and today Americans are the best fed people the world has ever known.
Yet average family income in non-metropolitan areas is 22 percent below that of metropolitan areas, and growing numbers of people have left rural America to seek fresh opportunity in the city. With this vast migration has come not just industrial progress, but also a host of new social and economic problems. Many of our cities are becoming less and less governable.
Only through balanced growth in both our rural and urban areas can we weather this gathering storm. It is time for all Americans to realize that we must have a strong rural economy in order to achieve orderly and beneficial urban growth.
In recognition of this need, I, RICHARD NIXON, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week of November 19 through November 25, as National Farm-City Week and call upon all citizens wherever they live to participate in this observance.
I request that leaders of agricultural organizations, business groups, labor unions, youth and women's clubs, schools, and other interested groups, focus their attention upon the interrelationship of urban and rural community development.
I urge the Department of Agriculture, land-grant educational institutions, and all appropriate organizations and Government officials to mark the significance of National Farm-City Week with public meetings, exhibits, and presentations for the press, radio, and television.

A Proclamation

"The character inherent in the American people," Thoreau observed long ago, "has done all that has been accomplished" by the United States in the cause of mankind. Today, character remains our greatest national resource. Developing character in individuals, and mobilizing it through community action, remains our most vital work.
Over the past half-century, no organization has contributed more splendidly to this work than the United States Jaycees. Through Jaycee programs, young men by the hundreds of thousands have broadened their lives toward fuller achievement and stretched out their hands toward fellowmen in need. The two letters " J C " say a great deal. They spell "benefactor" for unfortunate people, from mentally retarded children to Peruvian earthquake victims. They spell "partner" for government officials, law enforcement agencies, educators, and social workers in the more than 6,000 communities that have Jaycee chapters. They spell "growth" for the nearly 325,000 men who today live by the Jaycees' Creed--faith, brotherhood, freedom, the rule of law, the potential of man, the life of service.

NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, RICHARD NIXON, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning January 16, 1972, as National Jaycee Week. I encourage all Americans to accord due honor and recognition to the ideals and achievements of the U.S. Jaycees, and to the service-minded men who carry on this good work.

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the United Nations General Assembly is in the tradition of our Constitution and its Bill of Rights.

Both the Bill of Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights rest on the proposition that each person has rights which are his own, and that protection of these rights is the foundation of freedom and justice.

NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, RICHARD NIXON, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim December 10, 1971, as Human Rights Day and December 15, 1971, as Bill of Rights Day. I call upon the people of the United States of America to observe the week beginning December 10, 1971, as Human Rights Week. In 1971 let us recall the framework of freedom that we established in 1791. Through our commitment to justice and equal opportunity for all in our own nation, we can give strength and meaning to the hopes of the people of all nations.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of December, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-sixth.

PROCLAMATION 4097

Wright Brothers Day, 1971

December 10,1971

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

36 use 169.

The history of man is filled with dreams of flying. Throughout the ages, his fascination with the speed and grace of birds soaring through the skies led man to wish that he, too, might master the secrets of flight.
On December 17, 1903, Wilbur and Orville Wright answered this wish when they made the first successful flight in a heavier-than-air, mechanically propelled airplane.
Although that first flight lasted only twelve seconds, it freed man from the bonds which since his first step had held him to the earth. In that one flight across 120 feet of North Carolina sand, man caught hold of what before had been a mere dream--though our oldest and most daring dream. No matter what progress is made in our ability to fly through the air and the heavens, that first flight will always mark an epic moment in the history of man.
To commemorate the achievements of the Wright Brothers, the Congress, by a joint resolution of December 17, 1963 (77 Stat. 402), designated the seventeenth day of December of each year as Wright Brothers Day and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation inviting the people of the United States to observe that day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, RICHARD NIXON, President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon the people of this Nation, and their local and National Government officials, to observe Wright Brothers Day, December 17, 1971, with appropriate ceremonies and activities, both to recall the accomplishments of the Wright Brothers and to provide a stimulus to aviation in this country and throughout the world.
IN WITNESS W H E R E O F , I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of December, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-sixth.

EXPLANATION

The following tables are designed to serve as a guide to prior laws and other Federal instruments which are patently amended, repealed, referred to, or otherwise cited by the textual provisions of the public laws contained in this volume. These tables were initiated as a separate pamphlet to accompany Volume 70 of the United States Statutes at Large. Beginning with Volume 71, they are being published as an integral part of each volume.

From time to time the tables will be cumulated and made separately available as a convenience to users. Tables 1-9 of Volumes 70-84 covering the years 1956 through 1970 have been cumulated and published as a separate volume. Coverage and arrangement of the tables are subject to change with a view to improved usefulness.

LAWS AFFECTED IN VOLUME 85

The arrangement of the tables is outlined above. There are two basic groups: (1) Tables 1-10 cover amendments, repeals, and other actions directly affecting prior laws and other Federal instruments;, and (2) Tables 11-19 cover all citations and other references to prior laws and other Federal instruments.
Details of Arrangement.
Tables 1-9 are limited to cases in which prior laws and other Federal instruments are expressly affected.
Table 10 is a catch-all table designed as a finding aid to relationships which are expressed in general terms. Listed in this table are all public laws in this volume which contain such provisions as "notwithstanding any other provision of law," and "all laws in conflict with this law are hereby repealed."
Tables 11-19 cover all other cases in which prior laws or other Federal instruments are mentioned in the text of the public laws in this volume, without regard to the purpose underlying such reference.
In each of the basic groups the first and largest table is entitled "General Legislation," and contains listings of all laws affected which have not been codified in the Revised Statutes, the Internal Revenue Codes, the Canal Zone Code, or in those titles of the United States Code or District of Columbia Code which have been enacted into law. Succeeding tables cover these codified provisions, as well as other instruments such as reorganization plans, veterans regulations, Executive orders and proclamations, and treaties and other international agreements. The numbering of the tables in the two groups is parallel. Thus Table 2 and Table 12 both relate to the Revised Statutes; Table 7 and Table 17 both relate to veterans regulations.
Table 1 is arranged chronologically. In preparing this table the "basic act" principle has been followed. Under this principle the key listing of amendatory legislation will be found under the basic act affected, rather than under intervening amendments thereto. Furthermore, all laws included are treated as if tables covering prior volumes of the United States Statutes at Large were in existence. Thus, no attempt is made to give an historical picture of a law, and only the latest amendment in the chain will be reflected. Occasionally, to promote clarity, cross references have been supplied at key points.
Users of Table 1 should, therefore, look under the date, public law number, or statutes volume and page number of the basic act affected, in order to determine whether changes have been made by the public laws contained in this volume. Although a given section of any act may have been added at a later date, the section is carried under the date and statutes citation of the basic act. For this reason the page numbers in the column headed "Statutes volume and page" are the numbers of the page on which each act begins.
All tables are arranged chronologically, except where the existence of a system of codification mades possible a sequential arrangement from the lowest to the highest title or section number. In Tables 1-10 there is a "Comment" column, in which the nature of the affecting action is described. These are editorial comments, intended to reflect what is patent in the laws reviewed, and every effort has been made to avoid interpretations.
In Tables 11-19 the "Comment" column is unnecessary, since in each instance the comment would be "Cited" or "Referred to." In these tables, moreover, the number of columns has been held to a minimum in the interest of brevity. Thus Table 11 contains only three columns listing the date and number of the law referred to, and the page number in this volume at which the reference may be found.

CONTENTS AND EXPLANATION

B3

Caveat.
All the tables are editorially compiled and presented as reference guides only. Hence they have no evidentiary status or legal effect. Indirect or implied relationships are not included. These may be found through use of the Subject Index or through research based on the text itself.
The Office of the Federal Register invites criticisms or suggestions with a view to improving the tables wherever possible.
