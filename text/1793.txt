Sec ti on 1. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That whenever the executive authority of any state in the Union, or of either of the territories northwest or south of the river Ohio, shall demand any person as a fugitive from justice, of the executive authority of any such state or territory to which such person shall have fled, and shall moreover produce the copy of an indictment found, or an affidavit made before a magistrate of any state or territory as aforesaid, charging the person so demanded, with having committed treason, felony or other crime, certified as authentic by the governor or chief magistrate of the state or territory from whence the person so charged fled, it shall be the duty of the executive authority of the state or territory to which such person shall have fled, to cause him or her to be arrested and secured, and notice of the arrest to be given to the executive authority making such demand, or to the agent of such authority appointed to receive the fugitive, and to cause the fugitive to be delivered to such agent when he shall appear : But if no such agent shall appear within six months from the time of the arrest, the prisoner may be discharged. And all costs or expenses incurred in the apprehending, securing, and transmitting such fugitive to the state or territory making such demand, shall be
paid by such state or territory. Sec . 2. And be it further enacted, That any agent, appointed as
aforesaid, who shall receive the fugitive into his custody, shall be empowered to transport him or her to the state or territory from which he or she shall have fled. And if any person or persons shall by force set at liberty, or rescue the fugitive from such agent while transporting, as aforesaid, the person or persons so offending shall, on conviction, be fined not exceeding five hundred dollars, and be imprisoned not exceed-
ing one year. Sec . 3. And be it also enacted, That when a person held to labour
in any of the United States, or in either of the territories on the northwest or south of the river Ohio, under the laws thereof, shall escape into any other of the said states or territory, the person to whom such labour or service may be due, his agent or attorney, is hereby empowered to seize or arrest such fugitive from labour,(6) and to take him or her before

(a) Fugitives from justice. Holmes v. Jennison, governor of Vermont, 14 Peters, 540. A foreign government has no right, by the law of nations, to demand of the government of the United States a surrender of a citizen or subject of such foreign government, who has committed a crime in his own country, and is afterwards found within the limits of the United States. It is a right which has no existence without, and can only be secured by a treaty stipulation. Case of Jose Ferrierados Santos, 2 Brockenb. C. C. R. 493. (b) Fugitives from labour. In an action for the penalty by the owner of a fugitive slave, for obstructing the plaintiff in arresting and seizing his slave, under the 4th section of the act of Congress of Feb-

any judge of the circuit or district courts of the United States, residing or being within the. state, or before any magistrate of a county, city or town corporate, wherein such seizure or arrest shall be made, and upon proof to the satisfaction of such judge or magistrate, either by oral testi-

May be arrested on proof as required, and maybe removed to the place

ruary 12, 1793, whether the alleged slave owes his service or labour, is a question for the jury to decide. Hill v. Low, 4 Wash. C. C. R. 327.
If the defendant knowingly obstructs the owner or his agent in seizing the fugitive, he cannot excuse himself against the penalty, by pleading ignorance of the law, or an honest belief that the person was not a fugitive from service or labour. Ibid.
Mere obstruction, hindrance, or interruption, is no offence under this act, unless it be interposed to prevent a seizure in the first instance, or a re-capture in case the fugitives after seizure should escape ; and the offence in such case would be complete, although the owner should ultimately succeed in making the arrest. Ibid.
After the arrest is consummated, no subsequent obstruction, whilst the arrest continues, although it should afford an opportunity for escape, amounts to the offence ; although it might possibly entitle the owner to an action at common law : or if an escape in consequence of the obstruction should happen, it might amount to the other offence, a rescue. Ibid.
The act of Congress, respecting fugitives owing service or labour, does not apply to slaves brought by their masters from one state to another, who afterwards escape or refuse to return. Ex parte Simmons, 4 Wash. C. C. R. 396.
A sojourner who brings his slave with him to Pennsylvania, cannot claim him as his slave, after he has resided there six months. He is free by the law of that state of March 1, 1780. Ibid.
Under the act respecting fugitives from service of February 12, 1793, the judge or magistrate has no power to issue a warrant to arrest the fugitive, or commit him after the investigation is over, and the certificate is granted; although in practice the judge commits de die in diem pending the examination. The whole power is to examine, decide, and grant, or refuse the certificate. Worthington v. Preston, 4 Wash. C. C. R. 461.
If after the certificate is granted, the owner of a slave delivers him to the gaoler, who receives him, he is not officially liable for an escape, even although the commitment were under a warrant from the examining magistrate. Ibid.
Neither is the gaoler liable for an escape, as bailor, if there was no contract to pay him a reward for safe keeping, unless gross negligence be proved. Ibid.
On a question of freedom or slavery, the same rules of evidence prevail as in other cases concerning the right of property. Baldwin's C. C. R. 577.
A bill of sale is not necessary to pass the right to a slave. Ibid. A citizen of another state, from which a slave absconds into the state of Pennsylvania, may pursue and take him without warrant, and use as much force as is necessary to carry him back to his residence. Ibid. Such an absconding slave may be arrested on Sunday; in the night time; in the house of another, if no breach of the peace is committed. Ibid. This right of the master results from his ownership, and the right to the custody and service of the slave by the common law, and the 11th section of the abolition law of Pennsylvania, and other laws of that state. It is the same right by which bail may arrest the principal in another state. Ibid. The constitution of the United States does not confer, but secures the right to reclaim fugitive slaves against state legislation. Baldwin's Rep. 579. It is no offence against the laws of a state for a master to take his absconding slave to the state from whence he absconded. The offence consists only in taking a free person by force, under the act of Pennsylvania of 1820, and the act of 1780. Ibid. No person has a right to oppose the master in reclaiming his slave, or to demand proof of property. A judge or magistrate cannot order his arrest or detention, without oath, warrant, or probable cause. Ibid. The master may use force in repelling such opposition, or the execution of such order, and the officer who gives such order, and all concerned in its execution, are trespassers. Ibid. It is historically well known that the clause in the constitution of the United States, relating to persons owing service and labour in one state escaping into other states, was to secure to the citizens of the slaveholding states the complete right and title of ownership in their slaves, as property, in every state in the Union into which they might escape from the state where they were held in servitude. The full recognition of this right and title was indispensable to the security of this species of property in all the slaveholding states; and indeed was so vital to the preservation of their domestic interests and institutions, that it cannot be doubted that it is constituted a fundamental article, without the adoption of which the Union could not have been formed. Its true design was to guard against the doctrines and principles prevailing in the non-slaveholding states, by preventing them from intermeddling with or obstructing or abolishing the rights of the owners of slaves. Prigg v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. 16 Peters, 539. The owner of a fugitive slave has the same right to seize and to take him in a state to which he has escaped or fled, that he had in the state from which he escaped; and it is well known that this right to seize or recapture is universally acknowledged in all the slaveholding states. The court have not the slightest hesitation in holding, that under and in virtue of the constitution, the owner of the slave is clothed with authority in every state of the Union, to seize and recapture his slave; wherever he can do it without any breach of the peace, or illegal violence. In this sense, and to this extent, this clause in the constitution may properly be said to execute itself, and to require no aid from legislation, state or national. Ibid. The constitution does not stop at a mere annunciation of the rights of the owner to seize his abscond ing or fugitive slave, in the state to which he may have fled. If it had done so, it would have left the owner of the slave, in many cases, utterly without any adequate redress. Ibid.
The constitution declares that the fugitive slave shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom

SECOND CONGRESS. Sess . IT. Ch . 7. 1793.

from whence he fled.

mony or affidavit taken before and certified by a magistrate of any such state or territory, that the person so seized or arrested, doth, under the laws of the state or territory from which he or she fled, owe service or labour to the person claiming him or her, it shall be the duty of such

service or labour may be due. It is exceedingly difficult, if not impracticable, to read this language, and not to feel that it contemplated some further remedial redress than that which might be administered at the hand of the owner himself. "A claim" is to be made. Ibid.
"A claim" in a just juridical sense, is a demand of some matter as of right, made by one person upon another to do or to forbear to do some act or thing as a matter of duty. It cannot well be doubted, that the constitution requires the delivery of the fugitive " on the claim" of the master: and the natural inference certainly is, that the national government is clothed with the appropriate authority and functions to enforce it. The fundamental principle applicable to all cases of this sort would seem to be, that where the end is required, the means are given ; and where the duty is enjoined, the ability to perform it is contemplated to exist on the part of the functionaries to whom it is intrusted. Ibid.
The clause relating to fugitive slaves is found in the national constitution, and not in that of any state. It might well be deemed an unconstitutional exercise of the power of interpretation, to insist that the states are bound to provide means to carry into effect the duties of the national government; nowhere delegated or intrusted to them by the constitution. On the contrary, the natural, if not the necessary conclusion is, that the national government, in the absence of all positive provisions to the contrary, is bound, through its own proper departments, legislative, executive, or judiciary, as the case may require, to carry into effect all the rights and duties imposed upon it by the constitution. Ibid.
A claim to a fugitive slave is a controversy in a case " arising under the constitution of the United States," under the express delegation of judicial power given by that instrument. Congress, then, may call that power into activity, for the very purpose of giving effect to the right; and if so, then it may prescribe the mode and extent to which it shall be applied ; and how, and under what circumstances, the proceedings shall afford a complete protection and guarantee of the right. Ibid.
The provisions of the sections of the act of Congress of 12th February, 1793, on the subject of fugitive slaves, as well as relative to fugitives from justice, cover both the subjects; not because they exhaust the remedies, which may be applied by Congress to enforce the rights, if the provisions shall be found, in practice, not to attain the objects of the constitution: but because they point out all the modes of attaining those objects which Congress have as yet deemed expedient and proper. If this is so, it would seem, upon just principles of construction, that the legislation of Congress, if constitutional, must supersede all state legislation upon the same subject; and by necessary implication prohibit it. For if Congress have a constitutional power to regulate a particular subject, and they do actually regulate it in a given manner, and in a certain form, it cannot be that the state legislatures have a right to interfere. Where Congress have an exclusive power over a subject, it is not competent for state legislation to interfere. Ibid.
The clause in the constitution of the United States, relating to fugitives from labour, manifestly contemplates the existence of a positive, unqualified right on the part of the owner of the slave, which no state law or regulation can in any way qualify, regulate, control, or restrain. Any state law or regulation, which interrupts, limits, delays, or postpones the rights of the owner to the immediate command of his services or labour, operates, pro tanto, a discharge of the slave therefrom. The question can never be, how much he is discharged from; but whether he is discharged from any, by the natural or necessary operation of the state laws or state regulations. The question is not one of quantity or degree, but of withholding or controlling the incidents of a positive right. Ibid.
The constitutionality of the act of Congress relating to fugitives from labour, has been affirmed by the adjudications of the state tribunals, and by those of the courts of the United States. If the question of the constitutionality of the law were one of doubtful construction, such long acquiescence in it, such contemporaneous expositions of it; and such extensive and uniform recognitions would, in the judgment of the court, entitle the question to be considered at rest. Congress, the executive, and the judiciary, have, upon various occasions, acted upon this as a sound and reasonable doctrine. Cited, Stuart v. Laird, 1 Cranch, 299. Martin v. Hunter, 1 Wheat. 304. Cohens v. The Commonwealth of Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264. Ibid.
The provisions of the act of 12th February, 1793, relative to fugitive slaves is clearly constitutional in all its leading provisions; and, indeed, with the exception of that part which confers authority on state magistrates, is free from reasonable doubt or difficulty. As to the authority so conferred on state magistrates, while a difference of opinion exists, and may exist on this point, in different states, whether state magistrates are bound to act under it, none is entertained by the court, that state magistrates may, if they choose, exercise the authority, unless prohibited by state legislation. Ibid.
The power of legislation in relation to fugitives from labour, is exclusive in the national legislature. Ibid.
The right to seize and retake fugitive slaves, and the duty to deliver them up, in whatever state of the Union they may be found, is, under the constitution, recognized as an absolute positive right and duty, pervading the whole Union with an equal and supreme force; uncontrolled and uncontrollable by state sovereignty or state legislation. The right and duty are co-extensive and uniform in remedy and operation throughout the whole Union. The owner has the same security and the same remedial justice, and the same exemption from state regulations and control, through however many states he may pass with the fugitive slave in his possession, in transitu, to his domicile. Ibid.
The act of the legislature of Pennsylvania upon which the indictment against Edward Prigg, for carrying away a fugitive slave, is founded, is unconstitutional and void. It purports to punish as a public offence against the state, the very act of seizing and removing a slave by his master, which the constitution of the United States was designed to justify and uphold. Ibid.
There is no general principle in the law of nations, which requires a surrender of a fugitive slave. The surrender must be required by compact. Jones v. Vanzant, 2 M'Lean's C. C. R. 596.

And be it further enacted, That any person who shall knowingly and willingly obstruct or hinder such claimant, his agent or attorney in so seizing or arresting such fugitive from labour, or shall rescue such fugitive from such claimant, his agent or attorney when so arrested pursuant to the authority herein given or declared; or shall harbor or conceal such person after notice that he or she was a fugitive from labour, as aforesaid, shall, for either of the said offences, forfeit and pay the sum of five hundred dollars. Which penalty may be recovered by and for the benefit of such claimant, by action of debt, in any court proper to try the same; saving moreover to the person claiming such labour or service, his right of action for or on account of the said injuries or either of them.

Chap . VIII.--An Act for enrolling and licensing ships or vessels to be employed Feb. 18, 1793. in the coasting trade and fisheries, and for regulating the same.

Sect io n 1. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That ships or vessels, enrolled by virtue of "An act for registering and clearing vessels, regulating the coasting trade, and for other purposes," and those of twenty tons and upwards, which shall be enrolled after the last day of May next, in pursuance of this act, and having a license in force, or if less than twenty tons, not being enrolled shall have a license in force, as is herein after required, and no others, shall be deemed ships or vessels of the United States, entitled to the privileges of ships or vessels employed in the coasting trade or fisheries.
Sec . 2. And be it further enacted, That from and after the last day of May next, in order for the enrolment of any ship or vessel, she shall possess the same qualifications, and the same requisites, in all respects, shall be complied with, as are made necessary for registering ships or vessels, by the act, intituled "An act concerning the registering and recording of ships or vessels," and the same duties and authorities are hereby given and imposed on all officers, respectively, in relation to such enrolments, and the same proceedings shall be had, in similar cases, touching such enrolments; and the ships or vessels so enrolled, with the master, or owner or owners thereof, shall be subject to the same requi-

1812, ch. 40.

Damages for harboring or concealing a slave, in a free state, are recoverable only by the constitution and act of Congress. Ibid.
Notice that the persons harbored or concealed are fugitives from labour, need not be in writing by the claimant, or his agent, nor need it be given by either of them verbally. Notice under the act of Congress, means knowledge. Ibid.
If there be evidence conducing to show such notice or knowledge, it will go to the jury, who will judge of its sufficiency. The same principles apply to the evidence of harboring or concealing the fugitives. Ibid.
Any overt act, which intentionally places a fugitive from labour beyond the reach of his master, or is calculated to have such an effect, is a harboring of the fugitive within the statute. Jones v. Vanzant, 2 M`Lean's C. C. R. 611.

If the defendant had full knowledge from the negroes or otherwise, that they are fugitives from labour, it is notice under the statute. Ibid.
If the plaintiff was subjected to a certain reward, by the laws of Kentucky, for the return of his slaves, and the defendant was the cause of his liability to such payment, it may constitute a part of his damages. Ibid.

Where the defendant has been the means of the entire loss of the slave, evidence may be received of

the loss of such slave, by showing what his services were worth, as conducing to show that fact, for

what sum he might have been sold. Ibid.

The act of Congress on the subject of fugitive slaves is constitutional, and does not conflict with the

ordinance for the government of the Northwestern territory. Ibid.

Cha p. XVII.--An Act to regulate the Claims to Invalid Pensions.
Whe re as the act, passed at the last session of Congress, intituled "An act to provide for the settlement of the claims of widows and orphans barred by the limitations heretofore established, and to regulate the claims to invalid pensions," is found by experience inadequate to prevent the admission of improper claims to invalid pensions, and not to contain a sufficient facility for the allowance of such as may be well founded: Therefore,
Sec ti on 1. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the second, third and fourth sections of the said act, be repealed, and that in future, all claims to such pensions shall be regulated in the manner following,
to wit: First.--All evidence relative to Invalids shall be taken upon oath or
affirmation, before the judge of the district, in which such invalids reside, or before any three persons specially authorized by commission
from the said judge. Secondly.--The evidence relative to any claimant must prove decisive
disability to have been the effect of known wounds, received while in the actual line of his duty, in the service of the United States, during the late war. That this evidence must be the affidavits of the commanding officer or surgeon of the ship, regiment, corps or company, in

which such claimant served, or two other credible witnesses, to the same effect, setting forth the time and place of such known wound.
Thirdly.--Every claimant shall be examined upon oath or affirmation, by two physicians or surgeons, to be authorized by commission from the
said judge, who shall report, in writing, their opinion, upon oath or affirmation, of the nature of the said disability, and, in what degree, it prevents the claimant from obtaining his livelihood, by labor.
Fourthly.--Every claimant shall produce evidence of the time of his leaving the service of the United States. He must also produce evidence of three reputable freeholders of the city, town or county, in which he usually resided for the two years immediately after he left the service, as aforesaid, of the existence of his disability, during that period : and ascertaining, of their own knowledge, the mode of life, em-
ployment, labour or means of support of the claimant. Fifthly.--And the said claimant must produce the evidence of two
credible witnesses, of the continuance of his disability, from the expi-
ration of the said two years, to the time of his application. Sixthly.--Each claimant must show a good and sufficient cause why
he did not apply for a pension to the person or persons authorized to examine his claim, on or before the eleventh of December, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-eight, the time limited for applications of this
nature. Seventhly.--No evidence of any claimant shall be admitted whose
claim has been examined and rejected, on or before the aforesaid eleventh of December, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-eight.
Sec . 2. And be it further enacted, That the judge of the district shall transmit a list of such claims, accompanied by the evidence herein directed, to the Secretary for the department of War, in order that the same may be compared with the muster-rolls, and other documents in his
office; and the said Secretary shall make a statement of the cases of the said claimants to Congress, with such circumstances and remarks, as
may be necessary, in order to enable them to take such order thereon, as
they may judge proper. Sec . 3. And be it further enacted, That no person not on the pension-
list, before the twenty-third day of March, one thousand seven hundred and ninety-two, shall be entitled to a pension, who shall not have complied with the rules and regulations herein prescribed; saving however to all persons, all and singular their rights founded upon legal adjudications under the act, intituled " An act to provide for the settlement of the claims of widows and orphans, barred by the limitations heretofore established, and to regulate the claims to invalid pensionsBut it shall be the duty of the Secretary at War, in conjunction with the Attorney General, to take such measures as may be necessary to obtain an adjudication of the Supreme Court of the United States, on the validity of any such rights claimed under the act aforesaid, by the determination of

whole machine, he can maintain a title to it only by establishing that it is substantially new, with its structure and mode of operation. Ibid.
If the combinations existed before in machines of the same nature, up to a certain point, and the party's invention consists in adding some new machinery, or some improved mode of operation to the old, the patent should be limited to such improvement; for if it includes the whole machine, it includes more than his invention, and therefore cannot be supported. Ibid.
The patent act of the United States differs from the English in several particulars. A mere public use by others before taking a patent, or a sale thereof by the inventor, is not decisive against him here, as it is in England. Pennock et al. v. Dialogue, 2 Peters, 16.
It has not, and it cannot be denied, that an inventor may abandon his invention, and surrender or dedicate it to the public. The inchoate right thus given, cannot afterwards be resumed at his pleasure, for when gifts are once made to the public in this way, they become absolute. The true meaning of the words in the patent law, " not known or used before the application," is, not known or used by the
public, before the application. Ibid. Where a defect in the specification on which a patent has issued, arose from inadvertence or mistake,
and without any fraud or misconduct on the part of the patentee, the Secretary of State has authority to accept a surrender of the patent, and cancel the record thereof; whereupon he may issue a new patent on an amended specification for the unexpired fourteen years granted by the first patent. Grant v. Raymond, 6 Peters, 218.
The letters patent were obtained in 1822, and in 1829, the patentee having surrendered the same for an alleged defect in the specification, obtained another patent. The second patent is to be considered as having relation to the first patent in 1822, and not as having been issued on an original application. Shaw v. Cooper, 7 Peters, 292.
The taking of the oath required by the patent act, previous to the issuing of the patent, is but a prerequisite to the granting of the patent, and is in no degree essential to its validity ; and if not taken, still the patent is valid. No defect or concealment in the specification, will avoid the patent, unless it arose from an intention to deceive the public. Whittemore v. Cutter, 1 Gallis. C. C. R. 429.
The first inventor is entitled to the benefit of his invention, and if he reduce it to practice, and obtain a patent for it, a subsequent inventor cannot, by obtaining a patent, deprive him of his invention, or maintain an action against him or his patent. Woodcock v. Parker et al., 1 Gallis. C. C. R. 438.
A patent can in no case be for an effect only, but for an effect produced in a certain manner, or by a peculiar operation. Ibid.
The original inventor of a machine is exclusively entitled to a patent for it. Mere colourable differences, or slight improvements, will not affect his right. Odiorne v. Winkley, 2 Gallis. C. C. R. 51.
The law allows a party a patent for a new and useful invention, and by " useful invention," is meant, not an invention in all respects superior to the modes now in use for the same purpose, but useful, in contradistinction to frivolous and mischievous inventions. Lowell v. Lewis, 1 Mason's C. C. R. 182.
The patentee must describe in his patent in what his invention consists, with reasonable certainty; otherwise it is void for ambiguity. If it be for an improvement in an existing machine, he must, in his patent, distinguish the new from the old ; and confine his patent to such parts only as are new; for if both are mixed up together, and a patent is taken out for the whole, it is void. Ibid.
A joint patent may well be for a joint invention, but not for a sole invention of one of the patentees. If each of the patentees obtain patents for the same invention as his exclusive invention, and afterwards both obtain a joint patent for the same as their invention, the parties are not actually estopped from ascertaining the invention to be joint; but the former patents are very strong evidence against a joint
invention. Ibid. An inventor cannot, under the patent laws of the United States, have two subsisting valid patents at
the same time for the same invention. The first that he obtains, while it remains unrepealed, is an estoppel to any patent under the same patent act. Odiorne v. The Amesbury Nail Factory, 2 Mason's C. C. R. 28.
The first section of the patent act of 1793, construed in connection with the other sections of the act, meanj that the invention should not be known and used as the invention of any other person than the patentee before the application for a patent. Morris v. Huntington, Paine's C. C. R. 348.
To obtain a patent under the laws of the United States, the party must be the original inventor in reference to the whole world; it is not sufficient that he is the first inventor within the United States. Rutgenu. Kanowers, 1 Wash. C. C. R. 168.
One who is the inventor of an improvement in the principle of a machine, has the same right to use it, as the inventor of the original machine had to it. Aliter, if it be only in form and proportion. Gray et al. v. James et al., Peters's C. C. R. 394.
It is not enough that the thing designed to be embraced by the patent, should be made apparent on the trial, by comparison of the new with the old machine. The patent for the invention must distinguish the new from the old, so as to point out in what the improvement consists. Dixon v. Moyer, 4 Wash.
C. C. R. 68. Patents and the specifications annexed thereto, should be construed fairly and liberally, and not be
subject to any over nice or critical refinements. Ames v. Howard, 1 Sumner's C. C. R. 482. It is not necessary to the validity of a patent for a new and useful invention, that any of the ingredi-
ents should be new and unused before for the purpose. The true question is, whether the combination of materials by the patentee, is substantially new. Ryan v. Goodwin, 3 Sumner's C. C. R. 514.
Under the patent laws of the United States, the applicant for a patent must be the first as well as the original inventor, and a subsequent inventor, although an original inventor, is not entitled to a patent, if the invention is perfected and put in actual use by the first and an original inventor; and it is of no consequence whether the invention is extensively known or used, or whether the knowledge or use thereof

Infringement of a Patent Right.--By the provisions of the act of Congress of April 17, 1800, citizens and aliens as to patent rights, are placed substantially on the same ground. In either case, if the invention was known or used by the public before it was patented, the patent is void. Shaw v. Cooper, 7 Peters,

292.

.

No matter by what means an invention may have been communicated before the patent was obtained :

any acquiescence by the inventor in the public use, will be an abandonment of the right. If the right

were asserted by him who fraudulently obtained it, perhaps no lapse of time could give it validity. But

the public stand in an entirely different relation to the inventor. This right would be secured by giving

public notice that he was the inventor of the thing used, and that he should apply for a patent. Ibid.

A strict construction of the act of Congress, as it respects the public use of the invention, is not only

required by its letter and spirit, but sound policy. Ibid. The question of abandonment by the inventor does not depend on the intention of the inventor. It
without any intention, he suffers his invention to go to the public, he has no right to a patent. Ibid. Under the patent act of 1793, if the patentee has sold out a moiety of his patent, a joint action lies
by his vendee and himself, for a violation of the patent. Whittemore v. Cutter, 1 Gallis. C. C. R. 429. By the term " actual damage," which the plaintiff may recover under the patent law, is meant such
damages as he can actually prove, and has in fact sustained as contradistinguished from mere imaginary

or vindictive damages, which in personal torts are sometimes given. Ibid. If there be a mere making, and no use proved, nominal damages are to be recovered. The rule of
damages, if the use of the machine be proved, should be the value of the use of the machine during the

time the use was proved. Ibid. In an action for the infringement of a patent right, the law gives to a plaintiff treble the actual dam-
ages sustained by him; and the rule is to allow him treble the amount of the profits actually received by the defendant, in consequence of his using the plaintiff's invention. Lowell v. Lewis, 1 Mason's C. C.

It 182 The jury are to find single damages, and the court are to treble them. Gray et al. v. James, Peters's

C. C. R. 394. A patent may be for a new combination of machines to produce certain effects ; and this, whether the
machines constituting the combination be new or not. But in such a case, the patent being for the combination only, it is no infringement of the patent to use any of the machines separately, if the whole

combination be not used. Barrett et al. v. Hall et al., 1 Mason's C. C. R. 447. Where a party claims several distinct, independent improvements in the same machine, and procures
a patent for them in the aggregate, he is entitled to recover against any person who shall use any one of the improvements so patented, notwithstanding there shall have been no violation of the other improve-

ments. Moody v. Fiske et al., 2 Mason's C. C. R. 112. The jury may, in an action for the infringement of a patent, give the plaintiff, as a part of his actual
damages, such expenses for counsel fees, &c., as have been actually incurred in vindicating his right by suit, and which are not taxable in the bill of costs. Boston Manufacturing Company v. Fiske et al., 2

Mason's C. C. R. 119.

.

A patentee of an invention, notwithstanding he had given away his invention to another, may recover

for the violation of his patent; not having assigned away his whole title and interest in it, and no deed of

assignment having been recorded in the office of the Secretary of State. Parke v. Little, 3 Wash. C. C.

Proceedings and Pleadings in actions for the violation of Patent Rights. In the case of a rule before the district judge, to show cause why a patent should not be repealed, a record is to be made of the proceedings antecedent to the rule to show cause why process should not issue to repeal the patent, and upon which the rule was granted. Ex parte Wood and Brundage, 9 Wheat. 603; 5 Cond. Rep. 702.
The proceedings under the 10th section of the act of 1793, are in the nature of a scire facias at com-

mon law, to repeal a patent. Stearns v. Barrett, 1 Mason's C. C. R. 153. The scire facias in such a case ought to contain a direct allegation or suggestion that the patent was
obtained surreptitiously or upon false suggestion ; and to call upon the defendant for that cause only, to

show cause why the patent should not be repealed. Ibid. On an application for an injunction to restrain the infringement of a patent right, it should be stated in
the bill, or by affidavit, that the complainant is the inventor, and the bill must be sworn to : it is not sufficient that this fact was sworn to when the patent was obtained. Sullivan v. Redfield, Paine's C. C. R. 441. See Cutting v. Meyers, 4 Wash. C. C. R. 220. Pettibone v. Derringer, 4 Wash. C. C. R. 215.

Dixon v. Moyer, 4 Wash. C. C. R. 68. In an action for a violation of a patent right, it is sufficient, under the plea of the general issue, to
give notice that the plaintiff is not the inventor of the machine for which the patent has been obtained, if that constitutes the defence; without stating in the notice who was the inventor, or who had previously used the machine. Evans v. Kremer, Peters's C. C. R. 215. See Prouty v. Reynolds, 16 Peters, 336.
In an action for an infringement of a patent right, evidence that the. invention of the defendant is better than that of the plaintiff, is improper ; except to show a substantial difference between the two inventions.

Evidence in actions for the violation of Patent Rights.--Under the sixth section of the patent law of Feb.

1793 the defendant pleaded the general issue and gave notice that he would prove at the trial, that the

machine for the use of which, without license, the suit was brought, had been used previous to the alleged

invention at several places which were specified in the notices or some of them, and also at sundry other

places in Pennsylvania, Maryland, and elsewhere, in the United States. The defendant having given evi-

dence as to some of the places specified ; held, that evidence as to the other places was admissible, but

President of the United States, reciting the allegations and suggestions of the said petition, and giving a short description of the said invention or discovery, and thereupon granting to such petitioner, or petitioners, his, her, or their heirs, administrators or assigns, for a term not exceeding fourteen years, the full and exclusive right and liberty of making, constructing, using, and vending to others to be used, the said invention or discovery, which letters patent shall be delivered to the Attorney General of the United States, to be examined; who, within fifteen days after such delivery, if he finds the same conformable to this act, shall certify accordingly, at the foot thereof, and return the same to the Secretary of State, who shall present the letters patent thus certified, to be signed, and shall cause the seal of the United States to be thereto affixed : and the same shall be good and available to the grantee or grantees, by force of this act, and shah be recorded in a book, to be kept for that purpose, in the office of the Secretary of State, and delivered to the
patentee or his order. Sec . 2. Provided always, and be it further enacted, That any person,
who shall have discovered an improvement in the principle of any machine, or in the process of any composition of matter, which shall have been patented, and shall have obtained a patent for such improvement, he shall not be at liberty to make, use or vend the original discovery, nor shall the first inventor be at liberty to use the improvement: And it is hereby enacted and declared, that simply changing the form or the proportions of any machine, or composition of matter, in any degree,
shall not be deemed a discovery. Sec . 3. And be itfurther enacted, That every inventor, before he can
receive a patent, shall swear or affirm, that he does verily believe, that he is the true inventor or discoverer of the art, machine, or improvement, for which he solicits a patent, which oath or affirmation may be made before any person authorized to administer oaths, and shall deliver a written description of his invention, and of the manner of using, or process of compounding the same, in such full, clear and exact terms, as to distinguish the same from all other things before known, and to enable any person skilled in the art or science, of which it is a branch, or with which it is most nearly connected, to make, compound, and use the same. And in the case of any machine, he shall fully explain the principle, and the several modes in which he has contemplated the applica-

that the court possesses the power, which will be exercised, to prevent the plaintiff being injured by surprise. Evans v. Eaton, 3 Wheat. 454; 4 Cond. Rep. 291.
It is no objection to the competency of a witness in a patent cause that he is sued in another action for the infringement of the patent. Evans v. Hettich, 7 Wheat. 453 ; 5 Cond. Rep. 317.
The sixth section of the patent act does not enumerate all the defences of which the defendant may legally avail himself. He may give in evidence that he never did the act attributed to him : that the patentee is an alien, not entitled under the act; or that he has a license or authority from the patentee. Whittemore v. Cutter, 1 Gallis- C. C. R. 436.
It is a presumption of law, that where a patent and the specifications and drawings have been recorded in the patent office, every person who takes out a patent for a similar machine has a knowledge of the preceding patent.

There is no limitation to the ground on which the defendant, under the general issue may give in evidence that the patentee was not the original inventor. Evans v. Eaton, Peters' C. C. R. 322.
Surrender and Repeal of Patents.--The holder of a defective patent may surrender it to the department of state, and obtain a new one, which shall have relation to the emanation of the first. Shaw v. Cooper,
7 Peters 292. The great object and intention of the act granting patents for useful inventions is to secure to the public
the advantage to be derived from the discoveries of individuals, and the means it employs are the compensation to those individuals for the time or labour devoted, to those discoveries, by the exclusive right to make and sell the thing discovered for a limited time. Grant v. Raymond, 6 Peters, 218.
One who has patented his invention cannot take out a new patent for the same invention until the first is surrendered, repealed, or declared void. Morris v. Huntington, Paine's C. C. R. 348.
The obstacle of an invalid patent may be removed by having it declared void after a verdict against it, or by having a vacatur entered, exparte, in the office of the Secretary of State, on a surrender of the patent. But the provisions of the sixth section of the act do not enable a patentee to declare his own patent void; and a verdict in a suit on the second patent in favour of such patent does not avoid the first patent.

opposite party. And where there shall be more than two interfering applications, and the parties applying shall not all unite in appointing three arbitrators, it shall be in the power of the Secretary of State to appoint three arbitrators for the purpose.

And be it further enacted, That upon oath or affirmation being made, before the judge of the district court, where the patentee, his executors, administrators or assigns reside, that any patent, which shall be issued in pursuance of this act, was obtained surreptitiously, or upon false suggestion, and motion made to the said court, within three years after issuing the said patent, but not afterwards, it shall and may be lawful for the judge of the said district court, if the matter alleged shall appear to him to be sufficient, to grant a rule, that the patentee, or his executor, administrator or assign show cause, why process should not issue against him to repeal such patent. And if sufficient cause shall not be shown to the contrary, the rule shall be made absolute, and thereupon the said judge shall order process to be issued against such patentee, or his executors, administrators or assigns, with costs of suit. And in case no sufficient cause shall be shown to the contrary, or if it shall appear, that the patentee was not the true inventor or discoverer,
judgment shall be rendered by such court for the repeal of such patent; and if the party, at whose complaint, the process issued, shall have judgment given against him, he shall pay all such costs, as the defendant shall be put to, in defending the suit, to be taxed by the court, and recovered in due course of law.

Chap . VIII.--An Act for enrolling and licensing ships or vessels to be employed Feb. 18, 1793. in the coasting trade and fisheries, and for regulating the same.

Sect io n 1. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That ships or vessels, enrolled by virtue of "An act for registering and clearing vessels, regulating the coasting trade, and for other purposes," and those of twenty tons and upwards, which shall be enrolled after the last day of May next, in pursuance of this act, and having a license in force, or if less than twenty tons, not being enrolled shall have a license in force, as is herein after required, and no others, shall be deemed ships or vessels of the United States, entitled to the privileges of ships or vessels employed in the coasting trade or fisheries.
Sec . 2. And be it further enacted, That from and after the last day of May next, in order for the enrolment of any ship or vessel, she shall possess the same qualifications, and the same requisites, in all respects, shall be complied with, as are made necessary for registering ships or vessels, by the act, intituled "An act concerning the registering and recording of ships or vessels," and the same duties and authorities are hereby given and imposed on all officers, respectively, in relation to such enrolments, and the same proceedings shall be had, in similar cases, touching such enrolments; and the ships or vessels so enrolled, with the master, or owner or owners thereof, shall be subject to the same requi-

Damages for harboring or concealing a slave, in a free state, are recoverable only by the constitution and act of Congress. Ibid.
Notice that the persons harbored or concealed are fugitives from labour, need not be in writing by the claimant, or his agent, nor need it be given by either of them verbally. Notice under the act of Congress, means knowledge. Ibid.
If there be evidence conducing to show such notice or knowledge, it will go to the jury, who will judge of its sufficiency. The same principles apply to the evidence of harboring or concealing the fugitives. Ibid.
Any overt act, which intentionally places a fugitive from labour beyond the reach of his master, or is calculated to have such an effect, is a harboring of the fugitive within the statute. Jones v. Vanzant, 2 M`Lean's C. C. R. 611.

If the defendant had full knowledge from the negroes or otherwise, that they are fugitives from labour, it is notice under the statute. Ibid.
If the plaintiff was subjected to a certain reward, by the laws of Kentucky, for the return of his slaves, and the defendant was the cause of his liability to such payment, it may constitute a part of his damages. Ibid.

Where the defendant has been the means of the entire loss of the slave, evidence may be received of

the loss of such slave, by showing what his services were worth, as conducing to show that fact, for

what sum he might have been sold. Ibid.

The act of Congress on the subject of fugitive slaves is constitutional, and does not conflict with the

ordinance for the government of the Northwestern territory. Ibid.

And when any ship or vessel shall be in any other district than the one to which she belongs, the collector of such district, on the application of the master or commander thereof, and upon his taking an oath or affirmation, that according to his best knowledge and belief, the property remains, as expressed in the register or enrolment proposed to be given up, and upon his giving the bonds required for granting registers, shall make the exchanges aforesaid; but in every such case, the collector, to whom the register, or enrolment and license may be given up, shall transmit the same to the register of the treasury; and the register, or enrolment and license, granted in lieu thereof, shall, within ten days after the arrival of such ship or vessel within the district, to which she belongs, be delivered to the collector of the said district, and be by him cancelled.

Sec . 7. And be it further enacted, That the collector of each district shall progressively number the licenses by him granted, beginning anew at the commencement of each year, and shall make a record thereof in a book, to be by him kept for that purpose, and shall, once in three months, transmit to the register of the treasury, copies of the licenses, which shall have been so granted by him; and also of such licenses, as shall have been given up or returned to him, respectively, in pursuance of this act. And where any ship or vessel shall be licensed, or enrolled anew, or being licensed or enrolled, shall afterwards be registered, or being registered, shall afterwards be enrolled, or licensed, she shall, in every such case, be enrolled, licensed or registered by her former name.
Sec . 8. And be it further enacted, That if any ship or vessel, enrolled or licensed, as aforesaid, shall proceed on a foreign voyage, without first giving up her enrolment and license, to the collector of the district comprehending the port, from which she is about to proceed on such foreign voyage, and being duly registered by such collector, every such ship or vessel, together with her tackle, apparel and furniture, and the goods, wares and merchandise, so imported therein, shall be liable to seizure and forfeiture: Provided always, if the port, from which such ship or vessel is about to proceed on such foreign voyage, be not within the district, where such ship or vessel is enrolled, the collector of such district shall give to the master of such ship or vessel a certificate, specifying that the enrolment and license of such ship or vessel is received by him, and the time when it was so received ; which certificate shall afterwards be delivered by the said master to the collector, who may have granted such enrolment and license.
Sec . 9. And be it further enacted, That the license, granted to any ship or vessel, shall be given up to the collector of the district, who may have granted the same, within three days after the expiration of the time, for which it was granted, in case such ship or vessel be then within the district, or if she be absent, at that time, within three days from her first arrival within the district afterwards, or if she be sold out of the district, within three days after the arrival of the master within any district, to the collector of such district, taking his certificate therefor; and if the master thereof shall neglect, or refuse to deliver up the license, as aforesaid, he shall forfeit fifty dollars; but if such license shall have been previously given up to the collector of any other district, as authorized by this act, and a certificate thereof under the hand of such collector, be produced by such master, or if such license be lost, or destroyed, or unintentionally mislaid, so that it cannot be found, and the master of such ship or vessel shall make and subscribe an oath or affirmation, that such license is lost, destroyed, or unintentionally mislaid, as he verily believes, and that the same, if found, shall be delivered up, as is

And if such license shall be lost, destroyed, or unintentionally mislaid, as aforesaid, before the expiration of the time for which it was granted, upon the like oath or affirmation being made and subscribed by the master of such ship or vessel, the said collector is hereby authorized and required, upon application being made therefor, to license such ship or vessel anew.
Sec . 10. And be it further enacted, That it shall and may be lawful for the owner or owners of any licensed ship or vessel, to return such license to the collector who granted the same at any time within the year, for which it was granted, who shall thereupon, cancel the same and shall license such vessel anew, upon the application of the owner or owners, and upon the conditions herein before required, being complied with ; and in case the term, for which the former license was granted, shall not be expired, an abatement of the tonnage of six cents per ton shall be made, in the proportion of the time so unexpired.
Sec . 11.
