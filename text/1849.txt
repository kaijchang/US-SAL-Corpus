TREATY BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AND THE UTAH INDIANS.
The following articles have been duly considered and solemnly adopted by the undersigned -- that is to say, James S. Calhoun, Indian Agent, residing at Santa Fe, acting as commissioner on the part of the United States of America, and Quixiachigiate, Nanito, Nincocunachi, Abaganixe, Ramahi, Subleta, Rupallachi, Saguasoxego, Paguisachi, Cobaxanor, Amuche, Puigniachi, Panachi, Sichuga, Uvicaxinape, Cuchuticay, Nachitope, Pueguate, Guano Juas, Pacachi, Saguanchi, Acaguate nochi, Puibuquiacte, Quixache tuate, Saxiabe, Pichiute, Nochichigue, Uvive, principal and subordinate chiefs, representing the Utah tribe of Indians.
I. The Utah tribe of Indians do hereby acknowledge and declare, they are lawfully and exclusively under the jurisdiction of the government of said States : and to its power and authority they now unconditionally submit.
II. From and after the signing of this treaty, hostilities between the contracting parties shall cease, and perpetual peace and amity shall exist, the said tribe hereby binding themselves most solemnly never to associate with, or give countenance or aid to, any tribe or band of Indians, or other persons or powers, who may be, at any time, at enmity with the people or government of said States; and that they will, in all future time, treat honestly and humanely every citizen of the United States, and all persons and powers at peace with the said States, and all cases of aggression against said Utahs shall be referred to the aforesaid government for adjustment and settlement.
HI. All American and Mexican captives, and others, taken from persons or powers at peace with the said States, shall be restored and delivered by said Utahs to an authorized officer or agent of said States, at Abiquin, on or before the first day of March, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and fifty. And, in like manner, all stolen property, of every description, shall be restored by or before the aforesaid first day of March, 1850. In the event such stolen property shall have been consumed or destroyed, the said Utah Indians do agree, and are hereby bound, to make such restitution and under such circumstances as the government of the United States may order and prescribe. But this article is not to be so construed, or understood, as to create a claim against said States, for any losses or depredations committed by said Utahs.
IV. The contracting parties agree that the laws now in force, and such others as may be passed, regulating the trade and intercourse, and for the preservation of peace with the various tribes of Indians under the protection and guardianship of the government of the United States, shall be as binding and obligatory upon the said Utahs as if said laws had been enacted for their sole benefit and protection. And that said laws may be duly executed, and for all other useful purposes, the territory occupied by the Utahs is hereby annexed to New Mexico as now organized, or as it may be organized, or until the government of the United States shall otherwise order.
V. The people of the United States, and all others in amity with the United States, shall have free passage through the territory of said Utahs, under such rules and regulations as may be adopted by authority of said States.

VI. In order to preserve tranquility, and to afford protection to all

the people and interests of the contracting parties, the government of

the United States will establish such military posts and agencies, and

authorize such trading-houses, at such time and in such places as the

said government may designate.

VII. Relying confidently upon the justice and liberality of the United

States, and anxious to remove every possible cause that might disturb

their peace and quiet, it is agreed by the Utahs that the aforesaid gov-

ernment shall, at its earliest convenience, designate, settle, and adjust

their territorial boundaries, and pass and execute such laws, in their

territory, as the government of said States may deem conducive to the

happiness and prosperity of said Indians. And the said Utahs, further,

bind themselves not to depart from their accustomed homes or localities

unless specially permitted by an agent of the aforesaid government;

and so soon as their boundaries are distinctly defined, the said Utahs

are further bound to confine themselves to said limits, under such rules

as the said government may prescribe, and to build up pueblos, or to

settle in such other manner as will enable them most successfully to

cultivate the soil, and pursue such other industrial pursuits as will best

promote their happiness and prosperity : and they now, deliberately and

considerately, pledge their existence, as a distinct tribe, to abstain, for

all time to come, from all depredations ; to cease the roving and ram-

bling habits which have hitherto marked them as a people; to confine

themselves strictly to the limits which may be assigned them; and to

support themselves by their own industry, aided and directed as it may

be by the wisdom, justice, and humanity of the American people.

VIII. For, and in consideration of the faithful performance of all

the stipulations contained in this treaty by the said Utahs, the govern-

ment of the United States will grant to said Indians such donations,

presents, and implements, and adopt such other liberal and humane

measures, as said government may deem meet and proper.

IX. This treaty shall be binding upon the contracting parties from

and after the signing of the same, subject, in the first place, to the ap-

proval of the civil and military governor of New Mexico, and to such

other modifications, amendments, and orders as may be adopted by the

government of the United States.

In faith whereof, the undersigned have signed this treaty, and affixed

thereunto their seals, at Abiquin, in New Mexico, this the thirtieth day

of December, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and

forty-nine.

others acting for them, and dispose of the same at will, paying to the profit of the respective governments, such dues only as the inhabitants of the country wherein the said goods are, shall be subject to pay in like cases. And in case of the absence of the heir and representative, such care shall be taken of the said goods as would be taken of the goods of a native of the same country in like case, until the lawful owner may take measures for receiving them. And if a question should arise among several claimants as to which of them said goods belong, the same shall be decided finally by the laws and judges of the land wherein the said goods are.

Each of the two contracting parties may have, in the ports of the other, consuls, vice-consuls, and commercial agents, of their own appointment, who shall enjoy the same privileges and powers with those of the most favored nations; but if any such consuls shall exercise commerce, they shall be subject to the same laws and usages to which the private individuals of their nation are subject in the same place. The said consuls, vice-consuls, and commercial agents, are authorized to require the assistance of the local authorities for the search, arrest, detention and imprisonment of the deserters from the ships of war and merchant vessels of their country. For this purpose they shall apply to the competent tribunals, judges, and officers, and shall, in writing, demand the said deserters, proving, by the exhibition of the registers of the vessels, the rolls of the crews, or by other official documents, that such individuals formed part of the crews; and this reclamation being thus substantiated, the surrender shall not be refused. Such deserters, when arrested, shall be placed at the disposal of the said consuls, vice-consuls, or commercial agents, and may be confined in the public prisons, at the request and cost of those who shall claim them, in order to be detained until the time when they shall be restored to the vessel to which they belonged, or sent back to their own country by a vessel of the same nation, or any other vessel whatsoever. The agents, owners, or masters of vessels on account of whom the deserters have been apprehended, upon requisition of the local authorities, shall be required to take or send away such deserters from the states and dominions of the contracting parties, or give such security for their good conduct as the law may require. But if not sent back nor reclaimed within six months from the day of their arrest, or if all the expenses of such imprisonment are not defrayed by the party causing such arrest and imprisonment, they shall be set at liberty, and shall not
be again arrested for the same cause. However, if the deserters should

Art icl e XL
It is agreed that perfect and entire liberty of conscience shall be enjoyed by the citizens and subjects of both the contracting parties, in the countries of the one and the other, without their being liable to be disturbed or molested on account of their religious belief.

Proviso as to schools.

Art icl e XII.
If any ships of war or other vessels be wrecked on the coasts of the states or territories of either of the contracting parties, such ships or vessels, or any parts thereof, and all furniture and appurtenances belonging thereunto, and all goods and merchandise which shall be saved therefrom, or the produce thereof, if sold, shall be faithfully restored with the least possible delay to the proprietors, upon being claimed by them, or by their duly authorized factors; and if there are no such proprietors or factors on the spot, then the said goods and merchandise, or the proceeds thereof, as well as all the papers found on board such wrecked ships or vessels, shall be delivered to the American or Hawaiian consul,or vice-consul, in whose district the wreck may have taken place; and such consul, vice-consul, proprietors, or factors, shall pay only the expenses incurred in the preservation of the property, together with the rate of salvage and expenses of quarantine which would have been payable in the like case of a wreck of a national vessel; and the goods and merchandise saved from the wreck shall not be subject to duties unless entered for consumption, it being understood that in case of any legal claim upon such wreck, goods, or merchandise, the same shall be referred for decision to the competent tribunals of the
country.
Article XIII.
The vessels of either of the two contracting parties which may be forced by stress of weather or other cause into one of the ports of the other, shall be exempt from all duties of port or navigation paid for the benefit of the state, if the motives which led to their seeking refuge be real and evident, and if no cargo be discharged or taken on board, save such as may relate to the subsistence of the crew, or be necessary for the repair of the vessels, and if they do not stay in port beyond the time necessary, keeping in view the cause which led to their seeking
refuge.
Art icl e XIV.
The contracting parties mutually agree to surrender, upon official requisition, to the authorities of each, all persons who, being charged with the crimes of murder, piracy, arson, robbery, forgery, or the utterance of forged paper, committed within the jurisdiction of either, shall be found within the territories of the other, provided that this shall only be done upon such evidence of criminality as, according to the laws of the place where the person so charged shall be found, would justify his apprehension and commitment for trial, if the crime had there been committed; and the respective judges and other magistrates of the two governments shall have authority, upon complaint made under oath, to

7. Respecting an Invasion of Cuba.

By the Presid ent of the Uni ted States .

A PROCLAMATION.

There is reason to believe that an armed expedition is about to be fitted out in the United States, with an intention to invade the Island of Cuba, or
some of the Provinces of Mexico. The best information which the executive has been able to obtain, points to the Island of Cuba as the object of this expedition. It is the duty of this government to observe the faith of treaties, and to prevent any aggression by our citizens upon the territories of friendly nations. I have therefore thought it necessary and proper to issue this proclamation, to warn all citizens of the United States who shall connect themselves with an enterprise so grossly in violation of our laws and our treaty obligations, that they will thereby subject themselves to the heavy penalties denounced against them by our acts of Congress, and will forfeit their claim to the protection of their country. No such persons must expect the interference of this government, in any form, on their behalf, no matter to what extremities they may be reduced in consequence of their conduct. An enterprise to invade the territories of a friendly nation, set on foot and prosecuted within the limits of the United States, is in the highest degree criminal, as tending to endanger the peace, and compromit the honor, of this nation : -- and, therefore, I exhort all good citizens, as they regard our national reputation; as they respect their own laws, and the laws of nations; as they value the blessings of peace and the welfare of their country, to discountenance and prevent, by all lawful means, any such enterprise; and I call upon every officer of this government, civil or military, to use all efforts in his power to arrest, for trial and punishment, every such offender against the laws providing for the performance of our sacred obligations to friendly powers.

Wherea s , by an act of the Congress of the United States of the four-

teenth of August, eighteen hundred and forty-eight, entitled, "An Act to

establish the territorial government of Oregon," the President of the United

States is authorized to establish such ports of delivery in the collection dis-

trict created by that act, not exceeding two in number, (one of which shall be located on Fuget's Sound,) as he may deem proper: --

Now, therefore, I, Zachary Taylor, President of the United States of

America, do hereby declare and proclaim the ports of Nesqually (on Fuget's

Sound) and Portland, in the collection district of Oregon, in the Territory of

Oregon, to be constituted ports of delivery, with all the privileges authorized by law to such ports.

In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.

Satisfactory evidence that no discriminating duties are levied on vessels of the United States in the ports of Brazil.
Discriminating duties on Brazilian vessels and their cargoes suspended.
From 25th October, 1847.

And whereas satisfactory evidence has lately been received by me, from his

Majesty the Emperor of Brazil, through an official communication of Mr. Fe-

lippe Jose Pereira Leal, his charge daffaires in the United States, under date

of the 25th of October, 1847, that no other or higher duties of tonnage and

impost are imposed or levied in the ports of Brazil upon vessels wholly belong-

ing to citizens of the United States, and upon the produce, manufactures, or

merchandise imported in the same from the United States, and from any for-

eign country whatever, than are levied on Brazilian ships and their cargoes in

the same ports under like circumstances :

Now, therefore, I, James K. Polk, President of the United States of America,

do hereby declare and proclaim, that so much of the several acts imposing dis-

criminating duties of tonnage and impost within the United States are, and

shall be, suspended and discontinued so far as respects the vessels of Brazil,

and the produce, manufactures, and merchandise imported into the United

States in the same, from Brazil and from any other foreign country whatever,

the said suspension to take effect from the day above mentioned, and to con-

tinue thenceforward so long as the reciprocal exemption of the vessels of the

United States, and the produce, manufactures, and merchandise imported into

Brazil in the same as aforesaid, shall be continued on the part of the govern-

ment of Brazil. Given under my hand, at the city of Washington, this fourth day of No-
