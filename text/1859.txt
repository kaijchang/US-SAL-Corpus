ADVERTISEMENT.

In publishing the following Laws, the same plan has been adopted that was prescribed in the joint resolution of Congress of March 3, 1845, authorizing a subscription to the edition of all the Laws of the United States just published by us. As we have procured a careful collation with the records at Washington, by an experienced reader, and have scrupulously followed the original, we feel justified in saying that the public can safely rely on this publication. Any seeming errors, therefore, must be attributed to the Rolls, and not to us. Where anything absolutely necessary to the sense is omitted in the Rolls, our plan is to insert it in the text, enclosed in brackets.

ent government of Nicaragua shall be overthrown by force. Besides, the envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of that government in the United States has issued a notice, in pursuance of his instructions, dated on the 27th instant, forbidding the citizens or subjects of any nation, except passengers intending to proceed through Nicaragua over the Transit Route from ocean to ocean, to enter its territory without a regular passport, signed by the proper minister or consul-general of the republic resident in the country from whence they shall have departed. Such persons, with this exception, " will be stopped and compelled to return by the same conveyance that took them to the country." From these circumstances, the inference is irresistible that persons engaged in this expedition will leave the United States with hostile purposes against Nicaragua. They cannot, under the guise which they have assumed, that they are peaceful emigrants, conceal their real intentions, and especially when they know, in advance, that their landing will be resisted, and can only be accomplished by an overpowering force. This expedient was successfully resorted to previous to the last expedition, and the vessel in which those composing it were conveyed to Nicaragua, obtained a clearance from the collector of the port of Mobile. Although, after a careful examination, no arms or munitions of war were discovered on board, yet, when they arrived in Nicaragua, they were form'd to be armed and equipped and immediately commenced hostilities.
The leaders of former illegal expeditions of the same character have openly expressed their intention to renew hostilities against Nicaragua. One of them, who has already been twice expelled from Nicaragua, has invited, through the public newspapers, American citizens to emigrate to that republic, and has designated Mobile as the place of rendezvous and departure, and San Juan del Norte as the port to which they are bound. This person, who has renounced his allegiance to the United States, and claims to be President of Nicaragua, has given notice to the collector of the port of Mobile that two or three hundred of these emigrants will be prepared to embark from that port about the middle of November.
For these and other good reasons, and for the purpose of saving American citizens who may have been honestly deluded into the belief that they are about to proceed to Nicaragua as peaceful emigrants, if any such there be, from the disastrous consequences to which they will be exposed, I, JAMES BUCHANAN, President of the United States, have thought it fit to issue this my proclamation enjoining upon all officers of the government, civil and military, in their respective spheres, to be vigilant, active, and faithful in suppressing these illegal enterprises, and in carrying out their standing instructions to that effect; exhorting all good citizens, by their respect for the laws and their regard for the peace and welfare of the country, to aid the efforts of the public authorities in the discharge of their duties.
In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed to these presents.
Done at the city of Washington, the thirtieth day of October, one thousand eight hundred and fifty-eight, and of the independence of the
[L. S.] United States the eighty-third. JAMES BUCHANAN.

Art ic le I. The Winnebago Indians having now more lands than are necessary for their occupancy and use, and being desirous of promoting settled habits of industry and enterprise amongst themselves by abolishing the tenure in common by which they now hold their lands, and by assigning limited quantities thereof, in severalty, to the members of the tribe, including their half or mixed blood relatives now residing with them, to be cultivated and improved for their own individual use and benefit, it is hereby agreed and stipulated that the eastern portion of their present reservation, embracing townships one hundred and six, (106.) and one hundred and seven, (107,) range twenty-four (24,) and one hundred and six, (106,) and one hundred and seven (107,)

And no white person, except such as shall be in the employment of the United States, shall be allowed to reside or go upon any portion of said reservation, without the written permission of the Superintendent of Indian Affairs, or of the agent for the tribe.

Prior to the issue of said certificates, the Secretary of the Interior shall make such rules and regulations as he may deem necessary and expedient respecting the disposition of any of said tracts, in case of the death of the person or persons to whom they may be assigned, so that the same shall be secured to the families of such deceased persons ; and should any of the Indians to whom tracts shall be assigned abandon them, the said Secretary may take such action in relation to the proper disposition thereof as in his judgment may be necessary and proper.
Art ic le II. For the purpose of procuring the means of comfortably establishing the Winnebagoes upon the lands to be assigned to them in severalty, by building them houses, and by furnishing them with agricultural implements, stock animals, and other necessary aid and facilities for commencing agricultural pursuits under favorable circumstances, the lands embraced in that portion of their reservation not stipulated to be retained and divided, as aforesaid, shall be sold, under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, in parcels not exceeding one hundred and sixty acres each, to the highest bidder, for cash; the sales to be made upon sealed proposals to be duly invited by public advertisement. And should any of the tracts so to be sold have upon them improvements of any kind which were made by or for the Indians, or for government purposes, the proposals therefor must state the price for both the land and improvements. And if, after assigning to all the members of the tribe entitled thereto their proportions of land in severalty, there shall remain a surplus of that portion of the reservation retained for that purpose, outside of the exterior boundary line of the lands assigned in severalty, the Secretary of the Interior shall be authorized and empowered, whenever he shall think proper, to cause such surplus to be sold in the same manner as the other lands to be so disposed of, and the proceeds thereof to be paid over to the Winnebagoes, or used and applied for their benefit in such manner as he shall deem to be best for them.

Whereas the Swan Creek and Black River band of Chippewas, of Kansas Territory, who were parties to the treaty of May 9, 1836, claim to be entitled to participate in the beneficial provisions of the subsequent treaty of August 2, 1855, under a misapprehension of the terms and conditions of said instrument, the provisions of which were only designed to embrace the Chippewas of Saginaw and that portion of the Chippewas of Swan Creek and Black River who were then residing in Michigan ; and whereas a reservation of eight thousand three hundred and twenty acres, or thirteen sections of land, was set apart in Kansas Territory for the use of the Swan Creek and Black River band of Chippewas, in consideration of the cession and relinquishment of certain lands in the State of Michigan which were reserved for said band of Indians by the 6th article of the treaty of November 17, 1807; and in view of the fact that a part of the aforesaid band, who now reside in the Territory of Kansas, have not received their full proportion of the benefits designed to have been conferred upon them by the provisions' of the second article of the treaty of May 9, 1836, it is understood to be the intention of the United States, in the execution of these articles of agreement and convention, to manifest their liberality and disposition to encourage said Indians in agricultural pursuits, and, with a view to remove from their minds all erroneous impressions respecting the non-fulfilment of the stipulations of former treaties, a liberal provision will be made for their benefit as hereinafter expressed. It is further understood to be the intention of this instrument to unite the Munsee or Christian Indians with the aforesaid band of Chippewas, in order to provide them with a suitable and permanent home, as contemplated by the act of Congress entitled " An act to confirm the sale

Whe re as a treaty was made and concluded at the Sac and Fox Agency in the Territory of Kansas, on the first day of October, one thousand eight hundred and fifty-nine, by and between Alfred B. Greenwood, commissioner on the part of the United States, and certain chiefs and headmen hereinafter named representing the confederated tribes of Sacs and Foxes of the Mississippi, which treaty is in the following words, to wit: --

Preamble

Articles of agreement and convention made and concluded at the Sac and Fox agency, in the Territory of Kansas, on the first day of October, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and fifty-nine, by and between Alfred B. Greenwood, commissioner on the part of the United States, and the following named chiefs and delegates, representing the confederated tribes of Sacs and Foxes of the Mississippi, viz. Ke-o-kuk, Mack-a-sah-pee, Sha-bah-caw-kah, Mat-tah-tah, My-ahpit, Kaw-ah-kee, Kah-sha-moh-mee, Maw-mee-won-e-kah, and Cheko-skuk, they being thereto duly authorized by said confederated tribes.

Contracting parties.

Art ic le I. The Sacs and Foxes of the Mississippi having now more lands than are necessary for their occupancy and use, and being desirous of promoting settled habits of industry and enterprise amongst themselves by abolishing the tenure in common by which they now hold their lands, and by assigning limited quantities thereof, in severalty, to the individual members of the tribe, to be cultivated and improved for their individual use and benefit, it is hereby agreed and stipulated that the portion of their present reservation contained within the following boundaries, that is to say : beginning at a point on the northern boundary line of their reservation, six miles west of the northeastern corner of the same ; running thence due south, to the southern boundary of the same, twenty miles ; thence west, and along said southern boundary, twelve miles; thence due north, to the northern boundary of said reservation, twenty miles ; and thence east, along said boundary line, twelve miles, to the place of beginning -- estimated to contain about one hundred and fifty-
three thousand and six hundred acres -- shall be set apart and retained by them for the purposes aforesaid.

Arti cle II. Out of the lands so set apart and retained there shall be assigned to each member of said confederated tribe, without distinction of age or sex, a tract of eighty acres, to include, in every case, as far as practicable, a reasonable portion of timber. One hundred and sixty acres of said retained lands shall also be set apart and appropriated to the use and occupancy of the agent for the time being of said confederated tribe; and one hundred and sixty acres shall also be reserved for the establishment and support of a school for the education of the youth of the tribe. The location of the tracts, the assignment of which is provided for in this article, shall be made in as regular and compact a manner as possible, and so as to admit of a distinct and well-defined exterior boundary, embracing the whole of them and any intermediate portions or parcels of land or water not included in or made part of the tracts assigned in severalty. All such intermediate parcels of land and water shall be owned by the Sacs and Foxes of the Mississippi in common ; but, in case of increase in the tribe, or other cause, rendering it necessary or expedient, the said intermediate parcels of land shall be subject to distribution and assignment in such manner as the Secretary of the Interior may prescribe and direct. The whole of the lands, assigned or unassigned, embraced within said exterior boundary, shall constitute and be known as the reservation of the Sacs and Foxes of the Mississippi; and all laws which have been, or may be, passed by the Congress of the United States regulating trade and intercourse with Indian tribes shall have full force and effect over the same, and no white person, except such as shall be in the employment of the United States, shall be allowed to reside or go upon any portion of said reservation, without the written permission of the superintendent of the central superintendency, or of the agent of the tribe.
Art ic le III. The division and assignment in severalty among the Sacs and Foxes of the Mississippi of the laud hereinbefore reserved for that purpose shall be made under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, and his decision of all questions arising thereupon shall be final and conclusive. Certificates shall be issued by the commissioner of Indian Affairs for the tracts assigned in severalty, specifying the names of the individuals to whom they have been assigned, respectively, and that the said tracts are set apart for the exclusive use and benefit of the assignees and their heirs. And said tracts shall not be alienated in fee, leased, or otherwise disposed of, except to the United States, or to members of the Sac and Fox tribe, and under such rules and regulations as may be prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior. And said tracts shall be exempt from taxation, levy, sale, or forfeiture, until otherwise provided by Congress. Prior to the issue of the certificates aforesaid, the Secretary of the Interior shall make such rules and regulations as he may deem necessary or expedient respecting the disposition of any of
said tracts, in case of the death of the person or persons to whom they may be assigned, so that the same shall be secured to the families of such deceased persons; and should any of the Indians to whom tracts shall be assigned abandon them, the said Secretary may take such action in relation to the proper disposition thereof as, in his judgment, may be necessary and proper.
Art ic le IV. For the purpose of establishing the Sacs and Foxes of the Mississippi comfortably upon the lands to be assigned to them in severalty, by building them houses, and by furnishing them with agricultural implements, stock animals, and other necessary aid and facilities for commencing agricultural pursuits under favorable circumstances, the lands embraced in that portion of their present reservation, not stipu-
lated to be retained and divided as aforesaid, shall be sold, under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, in parcels not exceeding one hundred and sixty acres each, to the highest bidder, for cash ; the sale to be made upon sealed proposals, to be duly invited by public advertisement, and

TREATY WITH THE SACS AND FOXES. Octo ber 1, 1859.

the proceeds thereof to be expended, for the purposes hereinbefore recited, in such manner as the Secretary of the Interior may think proper. And
should any of the tracts so to be sold have upon them improvements of any kind which were made by or for the Indians, or for government purposes, the proposals therefor must state the price for both the land and the improvements. And if, after assigning to all the members of the tribe entitled thereto their proportion of land in severalty, there shall remain a surplus of that portion of the reservation retained for that purpose, outside of the exterior boundaries of the lands assigned in severalty, the Secretary of the Interior shall be authorized and empowered, whenever he shall think proper, to cause such surplus to be sold in the
same manner as the other lands to be so disposed of, and to apply the proceeds of such sale to the purposes and in the mode hereinbefore provided with respect to that portion of their present reservation not retained for distribution.
Art ic le V. The Sacs and Foxes of the Mississippi being anxious to relieve themselves from the burden of their present liabilities, and it being essential to their best interests that they should be allowed to commence their new mode of life, free from the embarrassments of debt, it is stipulated and agreed that debts which may be due and owing at the date of the signing and execution hereof, either by the said confederated tribes of Sacs and Foxes, or by individual members thereof, shall be liquidated, and paid out of the fund arising from the sale of their surplus lands, so far as the same shall be found to be just and valid on an examination thereof, to be made by their agent and the superintendent of Indian affairs for the central superintendency, subject to revision and correction by the Secretary of the Interior.
Art ic le VI. Should the proceeds of the surplus lands aforesaid prove insufficient to carry out the purposes and stipulations of this agreement, and further aid be, from time to time, requisite to enable the Sacs and Foxes of the Mississippi to sustain themselves successfully in agricultural or other industrial pursuits, such additional means as may be necessary therefor shall be taken from the moneys due and belonging to them under the provisions of former treaties; and so much of said moneys as may be required to furnish them further aid as aforesaid shall be applied in such manner, under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, as he shall consider best calculated to improve and promote their welfare. And, in order to render unnecessary any further treaty engagements or arrangements hereafter with the United States, it is hereby agreed and stipulated that the President, with the assent of Congress, shall have full power to modify or change any of the provisions of former treaties with the Sacs and Foxes of the Mississippi in such manner and to whatever extent he may judge to be necessary and expedient for their welfare and best interest.
Arti cle VII. The Sacs and Foxes of the Mississippi, parties to this agreement, are anxious that all the members of their tribe shall participate in the advantages herein provided for respecting their improvement and civilization, and to that end to induce all that are now separated to rejoin and reunite with them. It is therefore agreed that, as
soon as practicable, the commissioner of Indian Affairs shall cause the necessary proceedings to be adopted to have them notified of this agreement and its advantages, and to induce them to come in and unite with their brethren; and to enable them to do so, and to sustain themselves for a reasonable time thereafter, such assistance shall be provided for them at the expense of the tribe as may be actually necessary for that purpose: Provided, however, That those who do not rejoin and permanently reunite themselves with the tribe within one year from the date
of the ratification of this treaty shall not be entitled to the benefit of any of its stipulations.

of their tribe, and to such whole blood females as have intermarried with

white men, at the date of this agreement, three hundred and twenty acres

each; the location and allotments of said lands to be made out of that

portion relinquished by this treaty to the United States in trust, provided

the mixed or half bloods, and such females of their tribes as have inter-

married with white men, desire to do so. The allotments to such of the

mixed or half bloods as may be minors to be made by the agent of the

tribe, subject to the confirmation and approval of the Secretary of the

Interior; and in allotting lands to those provided for in this article, said

allotments shall be made so as to include their improvements, (if any,)

Postage on each letter or packet not exceeding half an ounce in weight, fifteen cents ; above half an ounce and not over one ounce, thirty cents ; over one ounce and not exceeding two ounces, sixty cents ; and so on, thirty cents being added for each additional ounce or fraction of an ounce.

It shall not, however, be permitted to pay less than the whole rate, and no account shall be taken of the prepayment of any fraction of that rate.
The newspapers, as well as the articles of printed matter enumerated in Article XIII. of the present convention, may be in like manner sent by the said direct lines, on condition of prepayment to destination.
The price of prepayment of newspapers, gazettes, and periodical works shall be levied at the rate of fifteen centimes in Belgium, and of three cents in the United States, for each package the weight of which shall not exceed ninety grammes (three ounces). Packages weighing more than ninety grammes shall pay an additional rate for each ninety grammes or fraction of ninety grammes.
The price of prepayment of stitched books, of bound books, pamphlets, papers of music, catalogues, prospectuses, advertisements, and notices of various kinds, printed, engraved, lithographed, or autographed, shall be levied at a rate of fifteen centimes in Belgium, and of three cents in the United States, per thirty grammes, (one ounce,) or fraction of thirty
grammes. The proceeds of the above-mentioned postages shall be divided in the
proportion of two-thirds, or two cents, to the profit of the country which shall furnish the packets, and one-third, or one cent, to the profit of the other country.
Arti cle XXIV. The postage for which the United States and Belgian Post Offices shall reciprocally account to each other upon letters which shall be exchanged by the said direct lines of steamers shall be established, letter by letter, according to the scale of progression established by the preceding article, as follows, viz:
The Belgian Office shall pay to the United States for each unpaid letter weighing half an ounce or less, originating in the United States and destined for Belgium, as well as for each letter of like weight prepaid in Belgium and destined for the United States, the sum of five cents (being the United States inland postage) when the Atlantic sea conveyance is performed by a Belgian mail steamer; and twelve cents (representing the maritime postage and the territorial postage of the United States) when said sea conveyance is performed by a United States mail steamer. On the other hand, the United States shall pay to the Belgian Office for each unpaid letter weighing half an ounce or less, originating in Belgium, and destined for the United States, as well as for each letter of like weight prepaid in the United States and destined for Belgium, the sum of three cents (being the Belgian inland postage) when the Atlantic sea conveyance is performed by a United States mail steamer; and the sum of ten cents (representing the maritime postage and the Belgium territorial postage) when the said sea conveyance is performed by a Belgian mail steamer.
Letter bills and acknowledgments of receipt for mails exchanged by means of direct steamers, shall be according to the forms annexed, marked A and B.
Arti cle XXV. On all letters originating and posted in other coun-
tries beyond the United States and mailed to and deliverable in Belgium, or originating and posted in countries beyond Belgium and mailed to and deliverable in the United States or its Territories, the foreign postage (other than that of Belgium and other than that of the United
States) is to be added to the postage stated in Article XXIII. And the

two Post Office Departments are mutually to furnish each other with lists

stating the foreign countries to which the foreign postage, and the amount

thereof must be absolutely prepaid, or must be left unpaid, either to their

destination or to a determined point. And until such lists are duly fur-

nished, neither country is to mail to the other any letter from foreign

countries beyond it, or for foreign countries beyond the country to which

the mail is sent.

Art ic le XXVI. The provisions established by Articles XII., XV.,

XVI., XVII., XVIII., XIX., XX., and XXL, as well as the last paragraph

of Article XIV., so far as they are applicable, shall be made to apply to

the correspondence which may be exchanged by any direct line of steam-

ers running between the United States and Belgium.

Art ic le XXVII. The Post Office Departments of Belgium and of

the United States shall have full authority to introduce and put in force

by common agreement all modifications in the arrangements of the present

convention, both in regard to the proportion of postages to be levied on

each side, and relative to all other measures of detail and execution,

whenever, by mutual consent, the two governments shall have recognized

the utility of such modifications.

Arti cle XXVIII. The present convention shall be put in execution

in the two countries one month after the exchange of ratifications, pro-

vided that the expenses of transportation over the British territory and

across the British channel shall not exceed four cents per single letter,

and that this postage shall be the only transit postage to be paid by the

contracting parties, under the head of correspondence exchanged in closed

mails, by way of England, between Belgium and the United States of

America, by the terms of the said convention. This convention shall re-

main in force until annulled by mutual consent, or by one of the con-

tracting parties after one year's notice given by such party to the other

of the intention to annul the same.

Made in duplicate original, and signed at Washington, the twenty-first
