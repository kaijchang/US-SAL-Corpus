Sec . 27. And be it further enacted, That at every delivery of coins made by the chief coiner to the treasurer, it shall be the duty of the treasurer, in the presence of the assayer, to take indiscriminately, a certain number of pieces of each variety for the annual trial of coins, (the number being prescribed by the director,) which shall be carefully

neither can have access to its contents without the presence of the other.

session, so that his accounts may be settled up to that time; and, in this settlement, he shall be entitled to a credit for the difference between the whole amount of the ingots delivered to him, and of the coins and bul-
lion received from him, since the last settlement, as an allowance for necessary waste: Provided, That this allowance shall not exceed two thousandths of the whole amount of the silver, or one and one-half thousandth of the whole amount of the gold, that had been delivered to him by the treasurer.
Sec . 30. And be it further enacted, That when the coins which are
the equivalent to any deposite of bullion are ready for delivery, they shall be paid over to the depositor, or his order, by the treasurer, on a warrant from the director ; and the payment shall be made, if demanded,

TWENTY-FOURTH CONGRESS. Sess .II. Ch . 3. 1837.

141

wishes of the depositor, unless when impracticable or inconvenient to do so; in which case, the denominations of coin shall be designated by
the director. Sec . 31. And be it further enacted, That for the purpose of enabling
the mint to make returns to depositors with as little delay as possible, it
shall be the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury to keep in the said mint, when the state of the treasury will admit thereof, a deposite of such amount of public money, or of bullion procured for the purpose,
as he shall judge convenient and necessary, not exceeding one million of dollars, out of which those who bring bullion to the mint may be paid the value thereof, as soon as practicable, after this value has been ascertained; that the bullion so deposited shall become the property of the United States; that no discount or interest shall be charged on moneys so advanced; and that the Secretary of the Treasury may at any time withdraw the said deposite, or any part thereof, or may, at his discretion, allow the coins formed at the mint to be given for their
equivalent in other money. Sec . 32. And be it further enacted, That to secure a due conformity
in the gold and silver coins to their respective standards and weights, an annual trial shall be made of the pieces reserved for this purpose at the mint and its branches, before the judge of the district court of the United States, for the eastern district of Pennsylvania, the attorney of the United States, for the eastern district of Pennsylvania, and the collector of the port of Philadelphia, and such other persons as the Presi-
dent shall, from time to time, designate for that purpose, who shall meet as commissioners, for the performance of this duty, on the second Monday in February, annually, and may continue their meetings by adjournment, if necessary; and if a majority of the commissioners shall fail to attend at any time appointed for their meeting, then the director of the mint shall call a meeting of the commissioners at such other time as he may deem convenient; and that before these commissioners, or a majority of them, and in the presence of the officers of the mint, such examination shall be made of the reserved pieces as shall be judged sufficient; and if it shall appear that these pieces do not differ from the standard fineness and weight by a greater quantity than is allowed by law, the trial shall be considered and reported as satisfactory; but if any greater deviation from the legal standard or weight shall appear, this fact shall be certified to the President of the United States, and if, on a view of the circumstances of the case, he shall so decide, the officer or officers implicated in the error shall be thenceforward disqualified
from holding their respective offices. Sec . 33. And be it further enacted, That copper bullion shall be
purchased for the mint, from time to time, by the treasurer, under instructions from the director; that the cost shall be paid from the fund hereinafter provided for; and that the copper bullion shall be of good

And be it further enacted, That it shall be the duty of the treasurer of the mint to deliver the copper coins, in exchange for their legal equivalent in other money, to any persons who shall apply for them: Provided, That the sum asked for be not less than a certain amount, .to be determined by the director, and that it be not so great as, in his judgment, to interfere with the capacity of the mint to supply
other applicants.

shoal outside of the point, among the east breakers. The gale increased to a hurricane, and forced the vessel on her beam ends, and her masts and bowsprit were cut away. The master and crew deserted her to save their lives. After various fruitless efforts to save her, the libellants, all pilots of the outer harbor of Mobile, two days after she was stranded, and while yet in great peril, succeeded ; and she was brought up to the city of Mobile by them, towed by their pilot boat, assisted by a steamboat employed by them. On a libel for salvage, the district court of the United States for the district of Alabama allowed, as salvage, one-third of 15,299 dollars and 58 cents, the appraised value of the brig and cargo. The owners of the brig and cargo appealed to the supreme court. By the Court--A pilot, while acting within the strict line of his duty, however he may entitle himself to extraordinary pilotage compensation for extraordinary services, as contradistinguished from ordinary pilotage for ordinary services, cannot be entitled to claim salvage. In this respect he is not distinguished from any other officer, public or private, acting within the appropriate sphere of his duty. But a pilot, as such, is not disabled, in virtue of his office, from becoming a salvor. On the contrary, whenever he performs salvage services beyond the line of his appropriate duties, or under circumstances to which those duties do not justly attach, he stands in the same relation to the property as any other salvor: that is, with a title to compensation to the extent of the merit of his services, viewed in the light of a liberal public policy. Hobart v. Drogan, 10 Peters, 108.
Seamen, in the ordinary course of things, in the performance of their duties, are not allowed to become salvors, whatever may have been the perils, or hardships, or gallantry of their services, in saving the ship and cargo. Extraordinary events may occur, in which their connexion with the ship may be dissolved, de facto, or by operation of law; or they may exceed their proper duty, in which cases they may be permitted to claim as salvors. Ibid.
It is not within the scope of the positive duties of a pilot to go to the rescue of a wrecked vessel, and employ himself in saving her, or her cargo, when she was wholly unnavigable. That is a duty entirely distinct in its nature, and no more belonging to a pilot than it would be to supply such a vessel with masts or sails, or to employ lighters to discharge her cargo in order to float her. It is properly a salvage service, involving duties and responsibilities, for which his employment may peculiarly fit him ; but yet in no sense included in the duty of navigating the ship. Ibid.
This was a case where the libellants acted as salvors, and not as pilots. They had, at the time, no particular relation to the distressed ship. They proffered useful services as volunteers, without any preexisting covenant that connected them with the duty of employing themselves for her preservation. The duties they undertook were far beyond any belonging to pilots ; and precisely those belonging to salvors. Ibid.
Suits for pilotage on the high seas, and on waters navigable from the sea, as far as the tide ebbs and flows, are within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States. The service is strictly maritime, and falls within the principles already established by the supreme court in the case of the Thomas Jefferson, 10 Wheaton's Rep. 428, and Peyroux v. Howard, 7 Peters' Rep. 324. Ibid.

The master and crew deserted her to save their lives. After various fruitless efforts to save her, the libellants, all pilots of the outer harbor of Mobile, two days after she was stranded, and while yet in great peril, succeeded ; and she was brought up to the city of Mobile by them, towed by their pilot boat, assisted by a steamboat employed by them. On a libel for salvage, the district court of the United States for the district of Alabama allowed, as salvage, one-third of 15,299 dollars and 58 cents, the appraised value of the brig and cargo. The owners of the brig and cargo appealed to the supreme court. By the Court--A pilot, while acting within the strict line of his duty, however he may entitle himself to extraordinary pilotage compensation for extraordinary services, as contradistinguished from ordinary pilotage for ordinary services, cannot be entitled to claim salvage. In this respect he is not distinguished from any other officer, public or private, acting within the appropriate sphere of his duty. But a pilot, as such, is not disabled, in virtue of his office, from becoming a salvor. On the contrary, whenever he performs salvage services beyond the line of his appropriate duties, or under circumstances to which those duties do not justly attach, he stands in the same relation to the property as any other salvor: that is, with a title to compensation to the extent of the merit of his services, viewed in the light of a liberal public policy. Hobart v. Drogan, 10 Peters, 108.
Seamen, in the ordinary course of things, in the performance of their duties, are not allowed to become salvors, whatever may have been the perils, or hardships, or gallantry of their services, in saving the ship and cargo. Extraordinary events may occur, in which their connexion with the ship may be dissolved, de facto, or by operation of law; or they may exceed their proper duty, in which cases they may be permitted to claim as salvors. Ibid.
It is not within the scope of the positive duties of a pilot to go to the rescue of a wrecked vessel, and employ himself in saving her, or her cargo, when she was wholly unnavigable. That is a duty entirely distinct in its nature, and no more belonging to a pilot than it would be to supply such a vessel with masts or sails, or to employ lighters to discharge her cargo in order to float her. It is properly a salvage service, involving duties and responsibilities, for which his employment may peculiarly fit him ; but yet in no sense included in the duty of navigating the ship. Ibid.
This was a case where the libellants acted as salvors, and not as pilots. They had, at the time, no particular relation to the distressed ship. They proffered useful services as volunteers, without any preexisting covenant that connected them with the duty of employing themselves for her preservation. The duties they undertook were far beyond any belonging to pilots ; and precisely those belonging to salvors. Ibid.
Suits for pilotage on the high seas, and on waters navigable from the sea, as far as the tide ebbs and flows, are within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States. The service is strictly maritime, and falls within the principles already established by the supreme court in the case of the Thomas Jefferson, 10 Wheaton's Rep. 428, and Peyroux v.

(a) On the 3d of March, 1837, Congress passed an act giving to the widow of any officer who had died in the naval service of the United States, authority to receive, out of the navy pension fund, half the monthly pay to which the deceased officer would have been entitled under the acts regulating the pay in the navy, in force on the 1st day of January, 1835. On the same day, a resolution was adopted by Congress, giving to Mrs. Decatur, widow of Captain Stephen Decatur, a pension for five years, out of the navy pension fund, and in conformity with the act of 30th June, 1834, and the arrearages of the half-pay of a post captain, from the death of Commodore Decatur, to the 30th June, 1834 ; the arrearages to be vested in trust for her by the Secretary of the Treasury. The pension and arrearages, under the act of 3d March, 1837, were paid to Mrs. Decatur on her application to Mr. Dickerson, the Secretary of the Navy, under a protest by her, that by receiving the same she did not prejudice her claim under the resolution of the same date. She applied to the Secretary of the Navy for the pension and arrears, under the resolution, which were refused by him. Afterwards, she applied to Mr. Paulding, who succeeded Mr. Dickerson as Secretary of the Navy, for the pension and arrears, which were refused by him. The Circuit Court of the County of Washington, in the District of Columbia, refused to grant a mandamus to the Secretary of the Navy, commanding him to pay the arrears, and to allow the pension under the resolution of March 3d, 1837. Held, that the judgment of the Circuit Court was correct. Decatur v. Paulding, 14 Peters, 497.
In general, the official duties of the head of one of the executive departments, whether imposed by act of Congress or by resolution, are not mere ministerial duties. The head of an executive department of the government, in the administration of the various and important concerns of his office, is continually required to exercise judgment and discretion. He must exercise his judgment in expounding the laws and resolutions of Congress, under which he is from time to time required to act. If he doubts, he has a right to call on the Attorney General to assist him with his counsel; and it would be difficult to imagine why a legal adviser was provided by law for the heads of departments, as well as for the President, unless their duties were regarded as executive, in which judgment and discretion were to be exercised. Ibid.
If a suit should come before the Supreme Court which involved the construction of any of the laws imposing duties on the heads of the executive departments, the Court certainly would not be bound to adopt the construction given by the head of a department. And if they supposed his decision to be wrong, they would, of course, so pronounce their judgment. But the judgment of the Court upon the construction of a law, must be given in a case in which they have jurisdiction ; and in which it is their duty to interpret the act of Congress, in order to ascertain the rights of the parties in the cause before them. The Court could not entertain an appeal from the decision of one of the Secretaries, nor revise his judgment in any case where the law authorized him to exercise his discretion or judgment. Nor can it, by mandamus, act directly upon the officer, or guide and control his judgment or discretion in the matters committed to his care, in the ordinary discharge of his official duties. The interference of the Court with the performance of the ordinary duties of the executive departments of the government would be productive of nothing but mischief; and this power was never intended to be given to them.

Sec . 3. And be it further enacted, That whenever it shall appear to the Commissioner that any patent was destroyed by the burning of the Patent Office building on the aforesaid fifteenth day of December, or
was otherwise lost prior thereto, it shall be his duty, on application therefor by the patentee or other person interested therein, to issue a new patent for the same invention or discovery, bearing the date of the original patent, with his certificate thereon that it was made and issued pursuant to the provisions of the third section of this act, and shall enter the same of record: Provided, however, That before such patent shall be issued, the applicant therefor shall deposite in the PatentOffice a duplicate, as near as may be, of the original model, drawings, and description, with specification of the invention or discovery, verified by oath, as shall be required by the Commissioner; and such patent and copies of such drawings and descriptions, duly certified, shall be admissible as evidence in any judicial court of the United States, and shall protect the rights of the patentee, his administrators, heirs, and assigns, to the extent only in which they would have been protected by the original patent and specification.
Sec . 4. And be it further enacted, That it shall be the duty of the Commissioner to procure a duplicate of such of the models destroyed by fire on the aforesaid fifteenth day of December, as were most valuable and interesting, and whose preservation would be important to the public; and such as would be necessary to facilitate the just discharge of the duties imposed by law on the Commissioner in issuing patents, and to protect the rights of the public and of patentees in patented inventions and improvements : Provided, That a duplicate of such models may be obtained at a reasonable expense: And provided, also, That the whole amount of expenditure for this purpose shall not exceed the sum of one hundred thousand dollars. And there shall be a temporary board of commissioners, to be composed of the Commissioner of the Patent Office and two other persons to be appointed by the President, whose duty it shall be to consider and determine upon the best and most judicious mode of obtaining models of suitable construction; and, also, to consider and determine what models may be procured in pursuance of, and in accordance with, the provisions and limitations in this section contained. And said commissioners may make and establish all such regulations, terms, and conditions, not inconsistent with law, as in their opinion may be proper and necessary to carry the provisions of this section into effect, according to its true intent.
Sec . 5. And be it further enacted, That, whenever a patent shall be returned for correction and re-issue under the thirteenth section of the act to which this is additional, and the patentee shall desire several patents to be issued for distinct and separate parts of the thing patented, he shall first pay, in manner and in addition to the sum provided by that act, the sum of thirty dollars for each additional patent so to be issued; Provided, however, That no patent made prior to the aforesaid fifteenth day of December, shah be corrected and re-issued until a duplicate of the model and drawing of the thing as originally invented, verified by oath as shall be required by the Commissioner, shall be deposited in the Patent Office ;

Nor shall any addition of an improvement be made to any patent

heretofore granted, nor any new patent be issued for an improvement

made in any machine, manufacture, or process, to the original inventor,

assignee, or possessor, of a patent therefor, nor any disclaimer be ad-

mitted to record until a duplicate model and drawing of the thing origi-

nally intended, verified as aforesaid, shall have been deposited in the

Patent Office, if the Commissioner shall require the same; nor shall

any patent be granted for an invention, improvement, or discovery, the

model or drawing of which shall have been lost, until another model

and drawing, if required by the Commissioner, shall, in like manner,

be deposited in the Patent Office;

And in all such cases, as well as in those which may arise under the

third section of this act, the question of compensation for such models

and drawings shall be subject to the judgment and decision of the com-

missioners provided for in the fourth section, under the same limitations

and restrictions as are therein prescribed.

Sec . 6. And be it further enacted, That any patent hereafter to be

issued, may be made and issued to the assignee or assignees of the in-

ventor or discoverer, the assignment thereof being first entered of

record, and the application therefor being duly made, and the specifica-

tion duly sworn to by the inventor. And in all cases hereafter, the

applicant for a patent shall be held to furnish duplicate drawings, when-

ever the case admits of drawings, one of which to be deposited in the

office, and the other to be annexed to the patent, and considered a part

of the specification.

Sec . 7. And be it further enacted, That, whenever any patentee shall

have, through inadvertence, accident, or mistake, made his specification

of claim too broad, claiming more than that of which he was the ori-

ginal or first inventor, some material and substantial part of the thing

patented being truly and justly his own, any such patentee, his adminis-

trators, executors, and assigns, whether of the whole or of a sectional

interest therein, may make disclaimer of such parts of the thing patented

as the disclaimant shall not claim to hold by virtue of the patent or as-

signment, stating therein the extent of his interest in such patent;

which disclaimer shall be in writing, attested by one or more witnesses,

and recorded in the Patent Office, on payment by the person disclaim-

ing, in manner as other patent duties are required by law to be paid,

of the sum of ten dollars. And such disclaimer shall thereafter be

taken and considered as part of the original specification, to the extent

of the interest which shall be possessed in the patent or right secured

thereby, by the disclaimant, and by those claiming by or under him

subsequent to the record thereof. But no such disclaimer shall affect

any action pending at the time of its being filed, except so far as may

relate to the question of unreasonable neglect or delay in filing the

same.

Sec . 8. And be it further enacted, That, whenever application shall

be made to the Commissioner for any addition of a newly-discovered

improvement to be made to an existing patent, or whenever a patent

shall be returned for correction and re-issue, the specification of claim

annexed to every such patent shall be subject to revision and restriction,

in the same manner as are original applications for patents; the Com-

missioner shall not add any such improvement to the patent in the one

case, nor grant the re-issue in the other case, until the applicant shall

have entered a disclaimer, or altered his specification of claim in ac-

cordance with the decision of the Commissioner; and in all such cases,

the applicant, if dissatisfied with such decision, shall have the same

remedy and be entitled to the benefit of the same privileges and pro-

ceedings as are provided by law in the case of original applications for

patents.

Sec . 9. And be it further enacted, any thing in the fifteenth section of the act to which this is additional to the contrary notwithstanding, That, whenever by mistake, accident, or inadvertence, and without any wilful default or intent to defraud or mislead the public, any patentee shall have in his specification claimed to be the original and first inventor or discoverer of any material or substantial part of the thing patented, of which he was not the first and original inventor, and shall have no legal or just right to claim the same, in every such case the patent shall be deemed good and valid for so much of the invention or discovery as shall be truly and bona fide his own; Provided, it shall be a material and substantial part of the thing patented, and be definitely distinguishable from the other parts so claimed without right as aforesaid. And every such patentee, his executors, administrators, and assigns, whether of the whole or of a sectional interest therein, shall be entitled to maintain a suit at law or in equity on such patent for any infringement of such part of the invention or discovery as shall be bona fide his own as aforesaid, notwithstanding the specification may embrace more than he shall have any legal right to claim. But, in every such case in which a judgment or verdict shall be rendered for the plaintiff, he shall not be entitled to recover costs against the defendant, unless he shall have entered at the Patent Office, prior to the commencement of the suit, a disclaimer of all that part of the thing patented which was so claimed without right: Provided, however, That no person bringing any such suit shall be entitled to the benefits of the provisions contained in this section, who shall have unreasonably neglected or delayed to enter at the Patent Office a disclaimer as aforesaid.
Sec . 10. And be it further enacted, That the Commissioner is hereby authorized and empowered to appoint agents in not exceeding twenty of the principal cities or towns in the United States as may best accommodate the different sections of the country, for the purpose of receiving and forwarding to the Patent Office all such models, specimens of ingredients and manufactures, as shall be intended to be patented or deposited therein, the transportation of the same to be chargeable to the
patent fund. Sec . 11. And be it further enacted, That, instead of one examining
clerk, as provided by the second section of the act to which this is additional, there shall be appointed, in manner therein provided, two examining clerks, each to receive an annual salary of fifteen hundred dollars; and also, an additional copying clerk, at an annual salary of eight hundred dollars. And the Commissioner is also authorized to employ, from time to time, as many temporary clerks as may be necessary to execute the copying and draughting required by the first section of this act, and to examine and compare the records with the originals, who shall receive not exceeding seven cents for every page of one hundred words, and for drawings and comparison of records with originals, such reasonable compensation as shall be agreed upon or prescribed by
the Commissioner. Sec . 12. And be it further enacted, That, whenever the application
of any foreigner for a patent shall be rejected and withdrawn for want of novelty in the invention, pursuant to the seventh section of the act to which this is additional, the certificate thereof of the Commissioner shall be a sufficient warrant to the Treasurer to pay back to such applicant two-thirds of the duty he shall have paid into the Treasury on
account of such application. Sec . 13. And be it further enacted, That in all cases in which an
oath is required by this act, or by the act to which this is additional, if the person of whom it is required shall be conscientiously scrupulous of taking an oath, affirmation may be substituted therefor.

remove thereto. If such arrangement cannot be effected, the United
States will afford its influence in obtaining a location for them at such place, west of the Mississippi, and southwest of the Missouri, as the
legislation of Congress may indicate. The agency of the exploration,
purchase, and removal will be performed by the United States, but the expenses attending the same shall be chargeable to said Indians at the Treasury, to be refunded out of the proceeds of their lands, at such

qu'aucuns droits, impots, ou charges pareils, ne seront demandes de nouveau, dans les ports du meme pays, ou les dits batimens pourraient vouloir entrer, apres, a moins que les batimens nationaux ne soient sujets a quelques droits ulterieurs dans le meme cas.

ARTICLE XII. Chacune des hautes parties contractantes, accorde a 1'autre la faculte d'entretenir dans ses ports et places de commerce, des Consuls, Vice Consuls, ou Agens de commerce, qui jouiront de toute la protection, et re^evront toute 1'assistance necessaire pour remplir duement leur fonctions; mais il est expressement declare que dans le cas d'une conduite illegale ou impropre envers les lois ou le Gouvernement du pays dans lequel les dits Consuls, Vice Consuls, ou Agens de commerce resideraient, ils pourront etre poursuivis et punis conformement aux lois, et prives de 1'exercise de leurs fonctions, par le Gouvernement offense, qui fera connoitre a 1'autre ses motifs pour avoir agi ainsi, bien entendu, cependant, que les archives et documens relatifs aux affaires d.u consulat seront a 1'abri de toute recherche, et devront etre soigneusement conserves sous le seelie des Consuls, Vice Consuls, ou Agens commerciaux, et de 1'autorite de 1'endroit ou ils resideraient. Les Consuls, Vice Consuls, et Agens commerciaux, ou ceux qui seraient duement autorises a les suppleer, auront le droit comme tels de servir de juges et d'arbitres dans les differens qui pourraient s'elever entre les capitaines et les equipages des batimens de la nation dont ils soignent les interets, sans que les autorites locales puissent y entrevenir, a moins que la conduite des equipages ou du capitaine ne troublat 1'ordre ou la tranquilite du pays, ou que les dits Consuls, Vice Consuls ou Agens commerciaux ne requissent leur intervention pour faire executer ou maintenir leurs decisions.

De tels deserteurs, lorsqu'ils auront ete arretes, seront mis a la disposition des dits Consuls, Vice Consuls, ou Agens commerciaux, et pourront etre enfermes dans les prisons publiques a la requisition et aux frais de ceux que les reclament, pour etre envoyes aux navires aux quels ils ftppartenaient ou a d'autres de la meme nation. Mais s'ils ne sont pas renvoyes dans 1'espace de deux mois, a compter du jour de leur arrestation, ils seront mis en liberte, et ne seront plus arretes pour la meme cause.
Il est entendu toute fois que si le deserteur se trouvoit avoir commis quelque crime ou delit, il pourra etre sursis a son extradition jusqu'a ce que le tribunal nanti de 1'affaire, aura rendu sa sentence, et que celle-ci ait re^u son execution.

Assistance to shipwrecked vessels, &c.

ARTICLE XIV.
In case any vessel of one of the high contracting parties shall have been stranded or shipwrecked, or shall have suffered any other damage on the coasts of the dominions of the other, every aid and assistance shall be given to the persons shipwrecked, or in danger, and passports shall be granted to them to return to their country. The shipwrecked vessels and merchandise, or their proceeds, if the same shall have been sold, shall be restored to their owners, or to those entitled thereto, if claimed within a year and a day, upon paying such costs of salvage as would be paid by national vessels, in the same circumstances, and the salvage companies shall not compel the acceptance of their services, except in the same cases, and after the same delays as shall be granted to the captains and crews of national vessels. Moreover, the respective Governments will take care that these companies do not commit any vexatious or arbitrary acts.

Quarantine.

ARTICLE XV.
It is agreed, that vessels arriving directly from the United States of America, at a port within the dominions of his Majesty the King of Greece, or from the Kingdom of Greece, at a port of the United States of America, and provided with a bill of health, granted by an officer having competent power to that effect, at the port whence such vessels shall have sailed, setting forth that no malignant or contageous diseases prevailed in that port, shall be subjected to no other quarantine than such as may be necessary for the visit of the health officer of the port where such vessels shall have arrived, after which said vessels shall be allowed immediately to enter and unload their cargoes; provided, always, thai there shall be on board no person who, during the voyage, `shall have been attacked with any malignant or contagious diseases; that such vessels shall not during their passage have communicated with any vessel liable itself to undergo a quarantine, and that the country whence they came, shall not at that time be so far infected or suspected, that before their arrival, an ordinance had been issued, in consequence of which, all vessels coming from that country should be considered as suspected, and consequently subject to quarantine.

Merchant vessels attempting to enter a blockaded port, &c.

ARTICLE XVI.
Considering the remoteness of the respective countries of the two high contracting parties, and the uncertainty resulting therefrom, with respect to the various events which may take place; it is agreed, that a merchant vessel belonging to either of them, which may be bound to a port supposed at the time of its departure to be blockaded, shall not, however, be captured or condemned, for having attempted a first time to enter said port, unless it can be proved that said vessel could and ought to have learned during its voyage, that the blockade of the place in question still continued. But all vessels which after having been warned off once shall during the same voyage attempt a second time to enter the same blockaded port, during the continuance of said blockade, shall then subject themselves to be detained and condemned.

Duration of the5
treaty.

ARTICLE XVII. The present treaty shall continue in force for ten years, counting from the day of the exchange of the ratifications, and if, before the expiration of the first nine years, neither of the high contracting parties shall have announced by an official notification to the other its intention to

ARTICLE XIV. Dans le cas ou quelque batiment de 1'une des hautes parties contractantes aura echoue, fait naufrage ou souffert quelque autre dommage sur les cotes de la domination de 1'autre, il sera donne tout aide et assistance aux personnes naufragees ou qui se trouveraient en danger, et il leur sera accorde des passeports pour retourner dans leur patrie. Les batimens et les marchandises naufrages, ou leurs produits s'ils ont ete vendus, seront restituees a leurs proprietaires ou ayant cause, s'ils sont reclames dans Fan et jour, en payant les frais de sauvetage que payeroient les batimens nationaux dans les memes cas, et les compagnies de sauvetage ne pourront faire accepter leurs services, que dans les memes cas, et apres les memes delais qui seraient accordes aux capitaines et aux equipages nationaux. Les Gouvernmens respectifs veilleront d'ailleurs a. ce que ces compagnies ne se permettent point de vexations ou d'actes arbitraires.
ARTICLE XV. 11 est convenu que les batimens qui arriveront directement des Etats Unis d'Amerique, a un port de la domination de Sa Majeste le Roi de la Grece, ou du Royaume de la Grece a un port des Etats Unis d'Amerique, et qui seroient pourvus d'un certificat de sante donne par 1'officier competent a cet egard du port d'ou les batimens sont sortis, et assurant qu'aucune maladie maligne ou contagieuse n'existait dans ce port, ne seront soumis a aucune autre quarantaine que celle qui sera necessaire pour la visite de 1'officier de sante du port ou les batimens seroient arrives, apres la quelle il sera permis a ces batimens d'entrer immediatement et de decharger leurs cargaisons; bien entendu, toute fois, qu'il n'y ait eu personne a leur bord qui ait ete attaque pendant le voyage d'une maladie maligne, ou contagieuse; que les batimens n'aient point communique dans leur traversee avec un batiment qui serait lui meme dans le cas de subir une quarantaine, et que la contree d'ou ils viendraient ne fut pas a cette epoque si generalement infectee ou suspectee qu'on ait rendu avant leur arrivee, une ordonnance d'apres la quelle tous les batimens venant de cette contree seraient regardes comme suspects, et, en consequence, assujettis a une quarantaine. '
ARTICLE XVI. Vu 1'eloignement des pays respectifs des deux hautes parties contractantes, et 1'incertitude qui en resulte sur les divers evenemens qui peuvent avoir lieu, il est convenu qu'un batiment marchand appartenant a 1'une d'elles qui se trouverait destine pour un port suppose bloque au moment du depart de ce batiment, ne sera cependant pas capture ou condamne pour avoir essaye une premiere fois d'entrer dans le dit port, a moins qu'il ne puisse etre prouve que le dit batiment avait pu et du apprendre en route que 1'Etat de blocus de la place en question durait encore; mais les batimens qui apres avoir ete renvoyes une fois essayeraient, pendant le meme voyage d'entrer une seconde fois dans le meme port bloque, durant la continuation de ce blocus se trouveront alors sujet a etre detenus et condamnes.
ARTICLE XVII. Le present traite sera en vigueur pendant dix annees a partir du jour de 1'echange des ratifications; et si avant 1'expiration des neufs premieres annees 1'une ou 1'autre des Hautes Parties Contractantes n'avait pas annoncee a 1'autre, par une notification officielle, son intention d'en

No. 31. Levying Tonnage Duty on Portuguese Vessels.

Preamble reciting that tonnage duty on vessels of Portugal is provisionally abolished, but the President authorized to levy said duty.
1832, ch. 104.
Vol. iv. p. 517.
Vessels of U. S. subjected to tonnage duty in ports of Portugal.
Tonnage duty henceforth to be levied on vessels of Portugal.

Whe re as , by an act of Congress of the United States of the twenty-fifth of

May, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-two, entitled " An act to exempt

the vessels of Portugal from the payment of duties of tonnage," it was enacted

as follows: " No duties upon tonnage shall be hereafter levied or collected of the

vessels of the kingdom of Portugal: Provided, always, That whenever the Pres-

ident of the United States shall be satisfied that the vessels of the United States

are subjected, in the ports of the kingdom of Portugal, to payment of any duties

of tonnage, he shall, by proclamation, declare the fact, and the duties now pay-

able by vessels of that kingdom, shall be levied and paid as if this act had not

been passed."

,

And whereas satisfactory evidence has been received by me, not only that

the vessels of the United States are subjected in the ports of the said kingdom

of Portugal to payment of duties of tonnage, but that a discrimination exists in

respect to those duties against the vessels of the United States.

Now, therefore, I, MARTIN VAN BUREN, President of the United States

of America, do hereby declare that fact, and proclaim, that the duties payable

by vessels of the said kingdom of Portugal, on the twenty-fifth day of May, one

thousand eight hundred and thirty-two, shall henceforth be levied and paid as if

the said act of the twenty-fifth of May, eighteen hundred and thirty-two, had not

been passed.

No. 31. Levying Tonnage Duty on Portuguese Vessels.

Oct. 11,1837. BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

A PROCLAMATION.

Preamble reciting that tonnage duty on vessels of Portugal is provisionally abolished, but the President authorized to levy said duty.
1832, ch. 104.
Vol. iv. p. 517.
Vessels of U. S. subjected to tonnage duty in ports of Portugal.
Tonnage duty henceforth to be levied on vessels of Portugal.

Whe re as , by an act of Congress of the United States of the twenty-fifth of

May, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-two, entitled " An act to exempt

the vessels of Portugal from the payment of duties of tonnage," it was enacted

as follows: " No duties upon tonnage shall be hereafter levied or collected of the

vessels of the kingdom of Portugal: Provided, always, That whenever the Pres-

ident of the United States shall be satisfied that the vessels of the United States

are subjected, in the ports of the kingdom of Portugal, to payment of any duties

of tonnage, he shall, by proclamation, declare the fact, and the duties now pay-

able by vessels of that kingdom, shall be levied and paid as if this act had not

been passed."

,

And whereas satisfactory evidence has been received by me, not only that

the vessels of the United States are subjected in the ports of the said kingdom

of Portugal to payment of duties of tonnage, but that a discrimination exists in

respect to those duties against the vessels of the United States.

Now, therefore, I, MARTIN VAN BUREN, President of the United States

of America, do hereby declare that fact, and proclaim, that the duties payable

by vessels of the said kingdom of Portugal, on the twenty-fifth day of May, one

thousand eight hundred and thirty-two, shall henceforth be levied and paid as if

the said act of the twenty-fifth of May, eighteen hundred and thirty-two, had not

been passed.

Given under my hand at the city of Washington, on the eleventh day of

October, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-seven, and of the independence

of the United States the sixty-second.
