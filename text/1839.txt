(a) See notes of the acts which have been passed relating to Virginia military land warrants, vol. 1,

464, vol. 3, 612. (6) Certain streets were laid out by the town of Charlestown, Massachusetts; and the proceedings
relative to the same were afterwards confirmed by an act of the Legislature. The streets passed over the land of John Harris ; and he afterwards received a compensation from the town for taking the land occupied by the streets. In 1800, the United States, under the authority of an act of the Legislature of Massachusetts, purchased of Mr. Harris several parcels of land, now occupied as a navy yard. And in 1801, by an arrangement between the town of Charlestown and the United States, the streets, so far as they were within the limits of the navy yard, were closed up, and have ever since been discontinued, and have been used as a part of the navy yard. The agent of the United States and Mr. Harris,, not agreeing as to the value of the land taken for the navy yard, the value was ascertained and determined by a jury proceeding under a law authorizing the same, and the amount of the valuation paid to Mr. Harris by the United States. The jury did not appraise the land on which the streets were laid out. One lot of ground was appraised " with the appurtenances." This action was instituted by the heirs of Mr. Harris claiming to be paid the value of the land on which the streets had been laid out, but which had been discontinued. The defendant was the commandant of the navy yard.
By the Court. The term " appurtenances," in common parlance, and in legal acceptation, is used to signify something appertaining to another thing as principal, and which passes as incident to the principal

Whereas Edward Beatty, of the county of Marion, in the state of Missouri, some time in the month of: March, eighteen hundred and thirty-six, emigrated to Missouri for the purpose of entering public lands; that, in consequence of the representations of others, he converted about nine hundred dollars in specie into certificates of deposit; that, after he had purchased the certificates at an advance of three per cent., he applied to the land office in Palmyra to enter land, when he was informed by the officers that the certificates could not be accepted, as none but the individual who made the deposit of money in the treasury could enter land with them. In consequence of this condition of the affair, the petitioner has lain out of the use of the money for a year and upwards, and has no prospect of getting it back for some years to come, unless he be aided by Congress.

authorized to enter land at any of the land offices in the state of Missouri, which is now liable to private entry, with the said certificates of deposit, at the price of one dollar and twenty-five cents per acre: Provided, however, That the said Beatty shall satisfy the register of the land office at which he may apply for the purpose of entering land, that the assignments on the same are genuine, and that he is legally entitled to the same.

Whereas Edward Beatty, of the county of Marion, in the state of Missouri, some time in the month of: March, eighteen hundred and thirty-six, emigrated to Missouri for the purpose of entering public lands; that, in consequence of the representations of others, he converted about nine hundred dollars in specie into certificates of deposit; that, after he had purchased the certificates at an advance of three per cent., he applied to the land office in Palmyra to enter land, when he was informed by the officers that the certificates could not be accepted, as none but the individual who made the deposit of money in the treasury could enter land with them.

The commissioners to decide on the justice of said claims, &c.

Mexico of the 5th of April, 1831; the said documents to be specified when demanded at the instance of the said commissioners.
ARTICLE V. The said commissioners shall, by a report under their hands and seals, decide upon the justice of the said claims and the amount of compensation, if any, due from the Mexican Government in each case.

Mexico at liberty to issue treasury notes for the amount found due.

ARTICLE VI.
It is agreed that if it should not be convenient for the Mexican Government to pay at once the amount so found due, it shall be at liberty, immediately after the decisions in the several cases shall have taken place, to issue Treasury notes, receivable at the maritime customhouses of the Republic in payment of any duties which may be due or imposed at said custom-houses upon goods entered for importation or exportation: said Treasury notes to bear interest at the rate of eight per centum per annum from the date of the award on the claim in payment of which said Treasury notes shall have been issued until that of their receipt at the Mexican custom-houses. But as the presentation and receipt of said Treasury notes at said custom-houses in large amounts might be inconvenient to the Mexican Government, it is further agreed that, in such case, the obligation of said Government to receive them in payment of duties, as above stated, may be limited to one half the amount of said duties.

And the compensation of such arbiter shall be paid, one half by the United States and one half by the Mexican Government.

The King of Prussia to be invited to appoint an umpire, in case, &c.

ARTICLE VIII. Immediately after the signature of this convention, the plenipotentiaries of the contracting parties (both being thereunto competently authorized) shall, by a joint note, addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of His Majesty the King of Prussia, to be delivered by the minister of the United States at Berlin, invite the said monarch to appoint an umpire to act in his behalf in the manner above-mentioned, in case this convention shall be ratified respectively by the Governments of the United States and Mexico.

Se conviene tambien del mismo modo, en que la misma libertad se estienda a las personas que se encuentren a bordo de buques libres, con el fin de que aunque dichas personas sean enemigos de ambas partes 6 de alguna de ellas, no deban ser estraidos de los buques libres a menos que sean oficiales 6 soldados en actual servicio de los enemigos: a condicion no obstante, y se conviene aqui en esto, que las estipulaciones contenidas en el presente articulo, declarando que el pabellon cubre la propiedad, se entenderan aplicables solamente a aquellas potencias que reconocen este principio; pero si alguna de las dos partes contratantes, estuviere en guerra con una tercera, y la otra permaneciese neutral, la bandera de la neutral cubrira la propiedad de los enemigos cuyos Gobiernos reconocen este principio, y no de otros.
ARTICULO XVI. Se conviene igualmente que en caso de que la bandera neutral de una de las partes contratantes, proteja las propriedades de los enemigos de la otra, en virtud de lo estipulado arriba, debera siempre entenderse, que las propiedades neutrales encontradas a bordo de tales buques enemigos, han de tenerse y considerarse como propiedades enemigas, y como tales estaran sujetas a detencion y confiscacion; esceptuando solamente aquellas propiedades que hubiesen sido puestas a bordo de tales buques antes de la declaracion de la guerra, y aun des-

ing parties agree, that six months having elapsed after the declaration, their citizens shall not plead ignorance thereof. On the contrary, if the flag of the neutral does not protect the enemy's property, in that case, the goods and merchandises of the neutral, embarked in such enemy's ship, shall be free.

Contraband specified.
Goods not contraband.
Definition of a blockade.

ARTICLE XVII. This liberty of navigation and commerce shall extend to all kinds of merchandise, excepting those only which are distinguished by the name of contraband : and under this name of contraband or prohibited goods, shall be comprehended : 1st. Cannons, mortars, howitzers, swivels, blunderbusses, muskets, fusees, rifles, carbines, pistols, pikes, swords, sabres, lances, spears, halberds, and grenades; bombs, powder, matches, balls, and all other things belonging to the use of these arms. 2d. Bucklers, helmets, breastplates, coats of mail, infantry belts, and clothes made up in military form, and for military use. 3d. Cavalry belts, and horses with their furniture. 4th. And generally, all kinds of arms and instruments of iron, steel, brass, and copper, or of any other materials, manufactured, prepared, and formed expressly to make war, by sea or land.
ARTICLE XVIII. All other merchandises and things, not comprehended in the articles of contraband explicitly enumerated and classified as above, shall be held and considered as free, and subjects of free and lawful commerce, so that they may be carried and transported in the freest manner, by the citizens of both the contracting parties, even to places belonging to an enemy, excepting only those places which are, at that time, besieged or blockaded : and to avoid all doubt in this particular, it is declared that those places only are besieged or blockaded which are actually attacked by a belligerent force capable of preventing the entry of a neutral.

Contraband only liable to confiscation.
Vessels delivering up contraband not to be detained.
In cases of blockade, vessels to be notified but not detained, &c.

ARTICLE XIX.
The articles of contraband before enumerated and classified, which may be found in a vessel bound for an enemy's port, shall be subject to detention and confiscation, leaving free the rest of the cargo and the ship, that the owners may dispose of them as they may see proper. No vessel of either of the two nations shall be detained on the high seas, on account of having on board articles of contraband, whenever the master, captain, or supercargo of said vessel will deliver up the articles of contraband to the captor, unless the quantity of such articles be so great, or of so large a bulk, that they cannot be received on board the capturing ship without great inconvenience ; but in this and in all other cases of just detention, the vessel detained shall be sent to the nearest convenient and safe port, for trial and judgment according to law.
ARTICLE XX. And whereas it frequently happens that vessels sail for a port or places belonging to an enemy, without knowing that the same is besieged, blockaded or invested, it is agreed that every vessel, so circumstanced, may be turned away from such port or place, but shall not be detained, nor shall any part of her cargo, if not contraband, be confiscated; unless, after warning of such blockade or investment, from any officer commanding a vessel of the blockading forces, they shall again attempt to enter; but she shall be permitted to go to any other port or place she shall think proper.

pues, si hubiesen sido embarcadas en dichos buques sin tener noticia de la guerra: y se conviene que pasados seis meses despues de la declaracion, los ciudadanos de una y otra parte no podran alegar que la ignoraban. Por el contrario, si la bandera neutral no protegiese las propiedades enemigas, entonces seran libres los efectos y mercaderias de la parte neutral embarcadas en buques enernigos.
ARTICULO XVII. Esta libertad de navegacion y comercio se estendera a todo genero de mercaderias, esceptuando aquellas solamente que se distinguen con el nombre de contrabando; y bajo este nombre de contrabando 6 efectos prohibidos, se comprenderan. 1. Canones, morteros, obuces, pedreros, trabucos, mosquet.es, fusiles, rifles, carabinas, pistolas, picas, espadas, sables, lanzas, chuzos, alabardas, y granadas, bombas, polvora, mechas, balas, con las demas cosas correspondientes al uso de estas armas. 2.

ARTICULO XVIII. Todas las demas mercaderias y efectos no comprendidos en los articulos de contrabando esplicitamente enumerados y clasificados en el articulo anterior, seran tenidos y reputados por libres, y de licito y libre comercio, de modo que ellos puedan ser transportados y llevados de la manera mas libre por los ciudadanos de ambas partes contratantes, aun a los lugares pertenecientes a un enemigo de una u otra, esceptuando solamente aquellos lugares 6 plazas que estan al mismo tiempo sitiadas 6 bloqueadas, y para evitar toda duda en el particular, se declaran sitiadas 6 bloqueadas aquellas plazas que en la actualidad estuviesen atacadas por una fuerza de un beligerante capaz de impedir la entrada del neutral.
ARTICULO XIX.
Los articulos de contrabando antes enumerados y clasificados, que se hallen en un buque destinado a puerto enemigo, estaran sujetos a detencion y confiscacion, dejando libre el resto del cargamento y el buque para que los duenos puedan disponer de ellos como lo crean conveniente. Ningun buque de cualquiera de las dos naciones, sera detenido por tener a bordo articulos de contrabando, siempre que el maestre, capitan 6 sobrecargo de dicho buque, quiera entregar los articulos de contrabando al apresador, a menos que la cantidad de estos articulos sea tan grande y de tanto volumen que no puedan ser recibidos a bordo del buque apresador sin grandes inconvenientes; pero en este, como en todos los otros casos de justa detencion, el buque detenido sera enviado al puerto mas inmediato, comodo y seguro, para ser juzgado y sentenciado conforme a las leyes.
ARTICULO XX. Y por cuanto frecuentemente sucede que los buques navegan para un puerto 6 lugar perteneciente a un enemigo, sin saber que aquel este sitiado, bloqueado 6 investido, se conviene en que todo buque en estas circunstancias se pueda hacer volver de dicho puerto 6 lugar, pero no sera detenido ni confiscado parte alguna de su cargamento, no siendo contrabando ; a menos que despues de la intimacion de semejante bloqueo 6 ataque por cualquier comandante de un buque de las fuerzas bloqueadoras, intentase otra vez entrar ; pero le sera permitido ir a cualquier otro puerto 6 lugar que juzgue conveniente.

ARTICLE XXI.
In order to prevent all kinds of disorder, in the visiting and examination of the ships and cargoes of both the contracting parties, on the high seas, they have agreed, mutually, that, whenever a vessel of war, public or private, shall meet with a neutral of the other contracting party, the first shall remain out of cannon shot, and may send its boats, with two or three men only, in order to execute the said examination of the papers, concerning the ownership and cargo of the vessel, without causing the least extortion, violence or ill treatment, for which the commanders of the said armed ships shall be responsible, with their persons and property : for which purpose, the commanders of the said private armed vessels shall, before receiving their commissions, give sufficient security to answer for all the damages they may commit; and it is expressly agreed, that the neutral party shall, in no case, be required to go on board the examining vessel for the purpose of exhibiting his papers, or for any other purpose whatever.

They have likewise agreed, that such ships being laden, besides the said sealetters or passports, shall also be provided with certificates containing the several particulars of the cargo, and the place whence the ship sailed, so that it may be known whether any forbidden or contraband goods be on board the same; which certificates shall be made out by the officers of the place whence the ship sailed, in the accustomed form : without such requisites said vessels may be detained, to be adjudged by the competent tribunal, and may be declared legal prize, unless the said defect shall be proved to be owing to accident, and satisfied or supplied by testimony entirely equivalent.

The citizens of all other occupations, who may be established in the territories or dominions of the United States and the Republic of Ecuador, shall be respected and maintained in the full enjoyment of their personal liberty and property, unless their particular conduct shall cause them to forfeit this protection, which, in consideration of humanity, the contracting parties engage to give them.
