AN ACT

For the relief of Joseph M. Cacace, Charles M. Cacace , and Mary E. Clibourne.

Whereas in the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Virginia, on the 20th day of November 1934, John T. Cacace was convicted of an offense and was thereupon admitted to bail in the penalty of $ 10,000 pending his motion for a new trial, and executed a recognizance for said sum with Joseph M. Cacace, Charles M. Cacace, and Mary E. Clibourne, his brothers and sister, as sureties ; and
Whereas on the 23d of November 1934 , said John T. Cacace without the knowledge, consent, or connivance of said sureties, willfully defaulted by leaving the jurisdiction and failed to appear on November 26, the time appointed for the hearing of his motion for a new trial, whereupon he was declared in default and on

motion of the United States, by its attorney, a scire facias issued on said date returnable on November 30, on which last- named

date the court declined to give the sureties on said bond additional

time for the purpose of attempting to produce said convict but forfeited said bond and entered judgment against the stipulators for the sum of $ 10,000 and costs ; and Whereas, on December 6, 1934, the said John T. Cacace voluntarily surrendered himself to the marshal of the district and was there-

after sentenced and is now serving his term in a penitentiary designated by the court ; and

Whereas the sureties on said recognizance filed their petition in said court, on December 8, 1934, praying that said judgment might be set aside and the forfeiture remitted, which prayer has been refused by the court upon the ground that under the statute in

such case made and provided it had no discretion where the default was willful ; and

ityRelfeoarsepfaryommelnitabiol-f court judgment.

Whereas by the voluntary appearance and the sentencing of said convict the ends of justice have been accomplished without additional expense to the Government so that nothing further is to
be gained by the enforcement of said judgment , which enforcement will cause said stipulators to lose their homes by foreclosure under execution : Now, therefore, Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the clerk of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Vir-
ginia at Norfolk is hereby authorized and directed to satisfy, of record, the judgment obtained by the United States on November 30, 1934, against Joseph M. Cacace, Charles M. Cacace, and Mary E. Clibourne, who are hereby relieved of all liability to the United States for the payment of said judgment, which was entered against them as sureties on the criminal bail bond executed in behalf of
John T. Cacace, the latter having failed to appear after he had willfully departed from the jurisdiction without the knowledge, consent, or connivance of said sureties. Said John T. Cacace subsequently voluntarily appeared on December 6, 1934, without cost to the Government, and was sentenced to imprisonment for conspiracy to violate the National Motor Vehicle Theft Act in accordance with

his previous conviction on November 24, 1934.

Floodable length.

REGULATION II.
Floodable Length.
(1. ) The floodable length at any point of the length of a ship shall be determined by a method of calculation which takes into consideration the form , draught and other characteristics of the ship in question .
(2.) In a ship with a continuous bulkhead deck, the floodable length at a given point is the maximum portion of the length of the ship, having its centre at the point in question , which can be flooded under the definite assumptions hereafter set forth in Regulation III without the ship being submerged beyond the margin line.

(3. ) In the case of a ship not having a continuous bulkhead deck, the floodable length at any point may be determined to an assumed continuous margin line, up to which, having regard to sinkage and trim after damage, the sides of the ship and the bulkheads concerned are carried watertight.

Permeability.

REGULATION III.
Permeability.
(1. ) The definite assumptions referred to in Regulation II relate to the permeabilities of the spaces below the margin line .
In determining the floodable length, a uniform average permeability shall be used throughout the whole length of each of the following portions of the ship below the margin line :-
(a) the machinery space as defined in Regulation I (8 ) ; (b) the portion forward of the machinery space ; and (c) the portion abaft the machinery space . (2 . )- (a . ) For steamships the uniform average permeability throughout the machinery space shall be determined from the formula-
80 +12.5 (* ), where
a= volume of the passenger spaces, as defined in Regulation I (9) , which are situated below the margin line within the limits of the machinery space.
c = volume of between deck spaces below the margin line within the limits of the machinery space which are appropriated to cargo, coal or stores.
v= whole volume of the machinery space below the margin line .
(b.) For ships propelled by internal combustion engines , the uniform average permeability shall be taken as 5 greater than that given by the above formula.

MULTILATERAL- SAFETY OF LIFE AT SEA-MAY 31, 1929
RGLE II .
Longueur envahissable.
(1.) Pour chaque point de la longueur du navire la longueur envahissable doit tre dtermine par une mthode de calcul tenant compte des formes, du tirant d'eau et des autres caractristiques du navire considr.
(2.) Pour un navire dont les cloisons transversales tanches sont limites par un pont de cloisonnement continu , la longueur envahissable en un point donn est la portion maximum de la longueur du navire, ayant pour centre le point considr et qui peut tre envahie par l'eau dans les conditions hypothtiques dfinies par la Rgle III , sans que le navire s'immerge au del de la ligne de surimmersion.
(3.) Pour un navire n'ayant pas de pont de cloisonnement continu , la longueur envahissable en chaque point peut tre dtermine en considrant une ligne de surimmersion continue, jusqu' laquelle, compte tenu de l'immersion et du changement d'assiette qui peuvent rsulter d'une avarie, la muraille du navire et les cloisons correspondantes sont maintenues tanches .
RGLE III.
Permabilit.
(1.) Les hypothses vises  la Rgle II sont relatives aux permabilits des volumes , limits suprieurement  la ligne de surimmersion.
Dans la dtermination des longueurs envahissables , on adopte une permabilit moyenne uniforme pour l'ensemble de chacune des trois parties suivantes du navire, limites suprieurement  la ligne de surimmersion :
(a) la tranche des machines, comme dfinie par la Rgle I (8 ) ; (b) la partie du navire  l'avant de la tranche des machines , et (c) la partie du navire  l'arrire de la tranche des machines .
(2 . )-- (a . ) Pour les navires  vapeur, la permabilit uniforme moyenne de la tranche des machines sera calcule par la formule
80 + 12,5( 0) dans laquelle :
a=volume des espaces  passagers suivant la dfinition de la Rgle I (9) , qui sont situs au-dessous de la ligne de surimmersion et compris dans la tranche des machines ;
c = volume des entreponts, affects aux marchandises , au charbon ou aux provisions de bord, qui sont situs au-dessous de la ligne de surimmersion et compris dans la tranche des machines ;
v= volume total de la tranche des machines au-dessous de la ligne de surimmersion.
(b.) Pour les navires qui ont des moteurs  combustion interne, la permabilit moyenne uniforme sera gale  la valeur donne par la formule prcdente augmente de 5.

TREATIES
(c.) Where it is shown to the satisfaction of the Administration that the average permeability, as determined by detail calculation , is less than that given by the formula, the calculated value may be substituted . For the purposes of such calculation , the permeabilities of passenger spaces, as defined in Regulation I (9 ) , shall be taken as 95, that of all cargo, coal and store spaces as 60 , and that of double bottom, oil fuel and other tanks at such values as may be approved in each case by the Administration .
(3. ) The uniform average permeability throughout the portion of the ship before (or abaft) the machinery space shall be determined from the formula-
63 +352, where

a= volume of the passenger spaces, as defined in Regulation I (9) , which are situated below the margin line , before (or abaft) the machinery space, and
v = whole volume of the portion of the ship below the margin line before (or abaft) the machinery space.

(4.) If a between deck compartment between two watertight transverse bulkheads contains any passenger or crew space, the whole of that compartment, less any space completely enclosed within permanent steel bulkheads and appropriated to other purposes, shall be regarded as passenger space. If, however, the passenger or crew space in question is completely enclosed within permanent steel bulkheads, only the space so enclosed need be considered as passenger space.

REGULATION IV.

Permissible length of compartments.

Permissible Length of Compartments.

Factor of sub-

division ,

(1.) Factor of Subdivision. - The maximum permissible length of a

compartment having its centre at any point in the ship's length is

obtained from the floodable length by multiplying the latter by an

appropriate factor called the factor of subdivision.

The factor of subdivision shall depend on the length of the ship,

and for a given length shall vary according to the nature of the

service for which the ship is intended. It shall decrease in a regular and continuous manner-

(a) as the length of the ship increases, and (b) from a factor A, applicable to ships primarily engaged in
the carriage of cargo, to a factor B, applicable to ships primarily engaged in the carriage of passengers .

MULTILATERAL- SAFETY OF LIFE AT SEA-MAY 31 , 1929
(c.) Lorsqu'on pourra tablir,  la satisfaction de l'Administration que la permabilit moyenne dtermine par un calcul direct est moindre que celle qui rsulte de la formule, on pourra substituer  cette dernire la permabilit calcule directement. Pour ce calcul direct, la permabilit des espaces affects aux passagers dfinis par la Rgle I (9 ) sera prise gale  95, celle des espaces affects aux marchandises , au charbon et aux provisions de bord, gale  60, et celle du double-fond, des soutes  combustible liquide et autres rservoirs sera fixe aux valeurs approuves dans chaque cas par l'Administration .
(3.) La permabilit moyenne uniforme sur toute la longueur du navire en avant (ou en arrire) de la tranche des machines , sera dtermine par la formule
63 +35
dans laquelle:
a= volume des espaces  passagers , suivant la dfinition de la Rgle I (9) , qui sont situs sous la ligne de surimmersion , en avant (ou en arrire) de la tranche des machines, et
v = volume total de la partie du navire au-dessous de la ligne de surimmersion et en avant (ou en arrire) de la tranche des machines.
(4. ) Si un compartiment, dans un entrepont, entre deux cloisons tanches transversales , renferme un espace affect aux passagers ou  l'quipage, on considrera comme espace  passagers l'ensemble de ce compartiment, en dduisant, toutefois , tout espace affect  un autre service qui serait compltement entour de cloisons mtalliques permanentes . Si, cependant, l'espace en question affect aux passagers ou  l'quipage est lui-mme compltement entour de cloisons mtalliques permanentes, on ne comptera que cet espace comme espace  passagers .
RGLE IV.
Longueur admissible des Compartiments.
(1.) Facteur de cloisonnement.-La longueur maximum admissible pour le compartiment ayant son centre en un point quelconque de la longueur d'un navire , se dduit de la longueur envahissable en multipliant celle-ci par un facteur appropri dit facteur de cloisonnement.
Le facteur de cloisonnement doit dpendre de la longueur du navire et, pour une longueur donne, varie selon la nature du service pour lequel le navire est prvu . Ce facteur doit dcrotre d'une faon rgulire et continue:
(a)  mesure que la longueur du navire augmente, et (b) depuis un facteur A applicable aux navires essentiellement
affects au transport des marchandises , jusqu' un facteur B applicable aux navires essentiellement affects au transport des passagers .

TREATIES
If one of the two adjacent compartments is situated inside the machinery space, and the second is situated outside the machinery space, and the average permeability of the portion of the ship in which the second is situated differs from that of the machinery space , the combined length of the two compartments shall be adjusted to the mean average permeability of the two portions of the ship in which the compartments are situated .
Where the two adjacent compartments have different factors of subdivision , the combined length of the two compartments shall be determined proportionately .
(2.) In ships 430 feet ( 131 metres) in length and upwards, one of the main transverse bulkheads abaft the fore peak shall be fitted at a distance from the forward perpendicular which is not greater than the permissible length.
(3.) A main transverse bulkhead may be recessed provided that all parts of the recess lie inboard of vertical surfaces on both sides of the ship, situated at a distance from the shell plating equal to one-fifth the breadth of the ship, as defined in Regulation I (3 ) , and measured at right angles to the centreline at the level of the deepest subdivision loadline .
Any part of a recess which lies outside these limits shall be dealt with as a step in accordance with the following paragraph .
(4.) A main transverse bulkhead may be stepped provided that--
(a) the combined length of the two compartments, separated by the bulkhead in question, does not exceed 90 per cent. of the floodable length, or
(b ) additional subdivision is provided in way of the step to maintain the same measure of safety as that secured by a plane bulkhead .
(5. ) Where a main transverse bulkhead is recessed or stepped, an equivalent plane bulkhead shall be used in determining the subdivision.
(6.) If the distance between two adjacent main transverse bulkheads , or their equivalent plane bulkheads , or the distance between the transverse planes passing through the nearest stepped portions of the bulkheads, is less than 10 feet (3.05 metres ) plus 2 per cent. of the length of the ship, only one of these bulkheads shall be regarded as forming part of the subdivision of the ship in accordance with the provisions of Regulation IV .

quarter length forward , amidships , and the quarter length aft, which

correspond to the three points obtained by dividing l into four equal parts (the areas corresponding to the two ends of the boat are con-

The areas A, B, C shall be deemed to be given in square metres

(or square feet) by the successive application of the following formula to each of the three cross-sections:-

h

3. If the sheer of the gunwale, measured at the two points situated at a quarter of the length of the boat from the ends , exceeds 1 per cent. of the length of the boat, the depth employed in calculating the area of the cross-sections A or C shall be deemed to be the depth amidships plus 1 per cent. of the length of the boat.

4. If the depth of the boat amidships exceeds 45 per cent. of the breadth, the depth employed in calculating the area of the midship cross-section B shall be deemed to be equal to 45 per cent. of the breadth , and the depth employed in calculating the areas of the quarter length sections A and C is obtained by increasing this last figure by an amount equal to 1 per cent . of the length of the boat, provided that in no case shall the depths employed in the calculation exceed the actual depths at these points.
5. If the depth of the boat is greater than 122 centimetres (equivalent to 4 feet ) the number of persons given by the application of this rule shall be reduced in proportion to the ratio of 122 centimetres to the actual depth, until the boat has been satisfactorily tested afloat with that number of persons on board, all wearing lifejackets .
6. Each Administration shall impose, by suitable formul, a limit for the number of persons allowed in boats with very fine ends and in boats very full in form.
7. Each Administration reserves the right to assign to a boat a capacity equal to the product of the length, the breadth and the depth multiplied by 0.6 if it is evident that this formula does not give a greater capacity than that obtained by the above method . The dimensions shall then be measured in the following manner:-
Length. From the intersection of the outside of the planking with the stem to the corresponding point at the stern post or, in the case of a square sterned boat, to the after side of the transom .

1. A ship shall be provided with sets of davits in accordance with

its length as provided in Column A of the Table in Regulation

XXXIX , provided that a number of sets of davits greater than the number of boats necessary for the accommodation of all the persons on board shall not be required .
Each set of davits shall have a boat of Class I attached to it. If

the lifeboats attached to davits do not provide sufficient accommoda-

tion for all the persons on board, additional lifeboats of one of the

standard types shall be provided . One additional lifeboat shall , in

the first place, be stowed under each of the boats attached to davits. After these have been fitted other boats shall be carried inboard , but

an Administration may, if it is of opinion that life rafts will be more

readily available and otherwise more satisfactory than these lifeboats in a case of emergency, allow life rafts to be carried provided that the

total capacity of the boats on the ship will be at least up to the mini-

mum capacity required by Column C of the Table in Regulation XXXIX .

When in the opinion of the Administration it is neither practicable nor reasonable to place on a ship the number of sets of davits required by Column A of the Table in Regulation XXXIX, the Administration may authorise, under exceptional conditions , a smaller number of sets of davits, provided always that this number shall never be less than the minimum number fixed by Column B of the Table and that the total capacity of the boats on the ship will be at least up to the minimum capacity required by Column C.
2. A ship engaged on short international voyages shall be provided with sets of davits in accordance with its length as provided in Column A of the Table in Regulation XXXIX. Each set of davits shall have a boat of Class I attached to it. If the lifeboats attached to davits do not provide the minimum cubic capacity specified in Column D of the Table in Regulation XXXIX or provide accommodation for all persons on board , additional lifeboats of one of the standard types , approved life rafts or other approved buoyant apparatus shall be provided, and the accommodation thus provided shall be sufficient for all on board.
When in the opinion of the Administration it is neither practicable nor reasonable to place on a ship engaged in short international voyages, the number of sets of davits required by Column A of the Table in Regulation XXXIX, the Administration may authorise , under exceptional conditions , a smaller number of sets of davits , provided always that this number shall never be less than the minimum number fixed by Column B of the Table, and that the total capacity of the boats on the ship will be at least up to the minimum capacity required by Column D.

TREATIES
(c.) The vessels referred to in this Article, when not making way through the water, shall not carry the side-lights , but when making way shall carry them.
(d.) The lights and shapes required to be shown by this Article are to be taken by other vessels as signals that the vessel showing them is not under command and cannot therefore get out of the way.
These signals are not signals of vessels in distress and requiring assistance . Such signals are contained in Article 31 .
ARTICLE 5.
A sailing vessel under way, and any vessel being towed , shall carry the same lights as are prescribed by Article 2 for a steam vessel under way, with the exception of the white lights mentioned therein , which they shall never carry.
ARTICLE 6 .
Whenever, as in the case of small vessels under way during bad weather, the green and red side lights cannot be fixed , these lights shall be kept at hand lighted and ready for use ; and shall, on the approach of or to other vessels , be exhibited on their respective sides in sufficient time to prevent collision, in such manner as to make them most visible, and so that the green light shall not be seen on the port side nor the red light on the starboard side, nor, if practicable, more than 2 points abaft the beam on their respective sides.
To make the use of these portable lights more certain and easy, the lanterns containing them shall each be painted outside with the colour of the light they respectively contain , and shall be provided with proper screens.
ARTICLE 7.
Steam vessels of less than 40 , and vessels under oars or sails of less than 20, tons gross tonnage, respectively, and rowing boats, when under way, shall not be obliged required to carry the lights mentioned in Article 2 (~) , (b) and (e) , but if they do not carry them they shall be provided with the following lights :--
1. Steam vessels of less than 40 tons shall carry: (a.)

(d. ) Les feux et les marques de jour prescrits par le prsent Article doivent tre regards par les autres navires comme des signaux indiquant que le btiment qui les montre n'est pas matre de sa manoeuvre et ne peut, par consquent, s'carter de la route.
Ces signaux ne sont pas des signaux de navire en dtresse et demandant assistance . Ces derniers signaux sont spcifis  l'Article 31 .
ARTICLE 5 .
Tout navire  voile qui fait route et tout navire remorqu doivent porter les feux prescrits  l'Article 2 pour un navire  vapeur faisant route  l'exception des feux blancs mentionns dans ledit Article, qu'ils ne doivent jamais porter.

ARTICLE 16 .

Speed etc.

limitations,

Every vessel shall, in a fog, mist, falling snow, or heavy rain-storms,
go at a moderate speed, having careful regard to the existing circumstances and conditions.

A steam vessel hearing , apparently forward of her beam, the fogsignal of a vessel the position of which is not ascertained , shall , so far as the circumstances of the case admit, stop her engines, and then navigate with caution until danger of collision is over.

Steering and Sailing Rules.

Preliminary-Risk of Collision.
Risk of collision can, when circumstances permit, be ascertained by carefully watching the compass bearing of an approaching vessel .  If the bearing does not appreciably change, such risk should be deemed to exist.

ARTICLE 17.

When two sailing vessels are approaching one another, so as to involve risk of collision, one of them shall keep out of the way of the other, as follows, viz.:-
(a.) A vessel which is running free shall keep out of the way of a vessel which is close-hauled .
(b.) A vessel which is close-hauled on the port tack shall keep out of the way of a vessel which is close-hauled on the starboard tack .
(c.) When both are running free , with the wind on different sides , the vessel which has the wind on the port side shall keep out of the way of the other.
(d.) When both are running free , with the wind on the same side , the vessel which is to windward shall keep out of the way of the vessel which is to leeward .
(e.) A vessel which has the wind aft shall keep out of the way of the other vessel.
ARTICLE 18 .
When two steam vessels are meeting end on, or nearly end on, so as to involve risk of collision, each shall alter her course to starboard , so that each may pass on the port side of the other.

This Article only applies to cases where vessels are meeting end on or nearly end on, in such a manner as to involve risk of collision , and does not apply to two vessels which must, if both keep on their respective courses, pass clear of each other.

Tout navire, par temps de brume, de brouillard , de bruine, de neige, ou pendant les forts grains de pluie , doit aller  une vitesse modre, en tenant attentivement compte des circonstances et des conditions existantes .
Tout navire  vapeur, en entendant, dans une direction qui lui parait tre sur l'avant de son travers , le signal de brume d'un navire dont la position est incertaine , doit, autant que les circonstances du cas le comportent, stopper sa machine et ensuite naviguer avec prcaution jusqu' ce que le danger de collision soit pass.
Rgles de Barres et de Route.
Prliminaires Risque de Collision. Le risque de collision peut, quand les circonstances le permettent,
tre constat par l'observation attentive du relvement au compas d'un navire qui s'approche . Si ce relvement ne change pas d'une faon apprciable, on doit en conclure que ce risque existe.
ARTICLE 17.
Lorsque deux navires  voiles s'approchent l'un de l'autre, de manire  faire craindre une collision , l'un d'eux doit s'carter de la route de l'autre comme il suit, savoir :
(a.) Tout navire courant largue doit s'carter de la route d'un navire qui est au plus prs .

The only cases to which it does apply are when each of the two vessels is end on , or nearly end on , to the other ; in other words, to cases in which, by day, each vessel sees the masts of the other in a line, or nearly in a line, with her own ; and , by night, to cases in which each vessel is in such a position as to see both the side-lights of the other.
It does not apply, by day, to cases in which a vessel sees another ahead crossing her own course ; or by night, to cases where the red light of one vessel is opposed to the red light of the other, or where the green light of one vessel is opposed to the green light of the other, or where a red light without a green light, or a green light without a red light, is seen ahead , or where both green and red lights are seen anywhere but ahead .

ARTICLE 19. When two steam vessels are crossing, so as to involve risk of collision, the vessel which has the other on her own starboard side shall keep out of the way of the other.
ARTICLE 20. When a steam vessel and a sailing vessel are proceeding in such directions as to involve risk of collision , the steam vessel shall keep out of the way of the sailing vessel.
ARTICLE 21 . Where by way of these Rules one of two vessels is to keep out of the way, the other shall keep her course and speed .
NOTE.-When , in consequence of thick weather or other causes , such vessel finds herself so close that collision cannot be avoided by the action of the giving-way vessel alone , she also shall take such acPost, pp. 1302, 1303. tion as will best aid to avert collision . (See Articles 27 and 29. )
ARTICLE 22. Every vessel which is directed by these Rules to keep out of the way of another vessel shall, if the circumstances of the case admit , avoid crossing ahead of the other.
ARTICLE 23.
Every steam vessel which is directed by these Rules to keep out of the way of another vessel shall , on approaching her, if necessary, slacken her speed or stop or reverse.

ARTIKEL IV.
Keine Person soll wegen eines vor ihrer Auslieferung begangenen Verbrechens oder Vergehens, derentwegen die Auslieferung nicht erfolgt ist, vor Gericht gestellt werden, es sei denn, dass sie whrend eines Monats, nachdem sie vor Gericht gestellt gewesen war, oder fr den Fall einer Verurteilung whrend eines Monats nach erfolgter Verbssung der Strafe oder Begnadigung die Freiheit gehabt hat, das Land zu verlassen.

1. A parcel may be redirected in consequence of the addressee's change of address in the country of destination, at the request of either the sender or the addressee.
The reforwarding of a parcel within one of the contracting countries gives rise to the collection of the supplementary charges pro-

vided for by the Administration of that country. The same is true, if occasion arises, in regard to the delivery of such parcel to another person at the original place of destination. These charges shall not be cancelled even in case the parcel is returned to origin or reforwarded to another country.
2. If a parcel must be reforwarded to one of the two countries signatory to the present Agreement, it is liable to new postage charges, and, if occasion arises, new insurance fees, unless such charges and fees have been paid in advance. The new postage and fees are collected from the addressee by the Administration effecting the delivery. Insured parcels must be reforwarded as such.
3. At the request of the sender or addressee, parcels may also be reforwarded or returned to another country. Insured parcels may
not, however, be reforwarded or returned except as such. The senders may mark the parcels : "Do not forward to a third country". In that case, the parcels must not be reforwarded to any other country. In case of loss, rifling or damage of an insured parcel reforwarded to another country or returned by that country, the indemnity is decided upon exclusively in accordance with the provisions of Article VII, Section 6.

Parcels liable to deterioration .

If, for any reason sale is impossible , the deteriorated or corrupted articles are destroyed. The sale or destruction gives rise to the making of a report which is sent to the Administration of origin.
5. Undeliverable parcels which the sender has abandoned may, at the expiration of a 30 -day period, be sold for the profit of the Administration of the country of destination. However, in the case of an insured parcel, a report is made up, which must be sent to the Administration of the country of origin. Likewise , the Administra-

In case of reforwarding, etc.

1. For each parcel exchanged between the contracting countries, the dispatching Office credits to the Office of destination in the parcel bills the quotas due to the latter, and indicated in the Regulations of Execution.
2. In case of reforwarding or return to origin of a parcel , if new postage and new insurance fees (in the case of insured parcels ) are collected by the redispatching Office, the parcel is treated as if it had originated in that country. Otherwise, the redispatching Office recovers from the other Office the quota due to it, namely, as the case may be :

Parcels to or from a third country.

(a ) the charges prescribed by Section 1 above ; (b) the charges for reforwarding or return . In case of reforwarding or return to a third country, the accrued charges, that is, such of the charges mentioned in (a ) and (b ) above as are applicable, shall follow the parcel, but in the case that the third country concerned refuses to assume the charges because they cannot be collected from the addressee or sender, as the case may be,

or for any other reason, they shall be charged back to the country of origin.

In the case of a parcel returned or reforwarded in transit through one of the two Administrations to or from the other, the intermediary

Administration may claim also the sum due to it for any additional territorial or sea service provided, together with any amounts due to any other Administration or Administrations concerned.

In extraordinary circumstances such as will justify the measure,

either Administration may temporarily suspend the parcel- post

REGULATIONS OF EXECUTION FOR THE PARCEL POST AGREEMENT

Regulations for execution .

The following detailed Regulations for the Execution of the Parcel Post Agreement have been agreed upon by the Chiefs of the Postal Administrations of the United States of America and the Bahamas .
ARTICLE 1

Limits of Weight and Size.

Limits and size.

of weight

1. The parcels to be exchanged under the provisions of this Agreement may not exceed 22 pounds in weight nor the following dimensions :

Greatest length 4 feet , on condition that parcels over 42 inches but

not over 44 inches long do not exceed 24 inches in girth ; that parcels over 44 inches but not over 46 inches long do not exceed 20 inches in girth ; that parcels over 46 inches but not over 48 inches long do not

exceed 16 inches in girth ; and that parcels up to 32 feet in length do not exceed 6 feet in length and girth combined.

The limit of weight and maximum dimensions stated above may be changed from time to time by agreement made through correspondence.
2. In regard to the exact calculation of the weight and dimensions, the indications furnished by the dispatching office will be accepted save in the case of obvious error.

ARTICLE 2

Preparation of Parcels.
Preparation of par- 1. The name and address of the sender and of the addressee must cels.
be written legibly and correctly on the parcel itself if possible or on a label or tag securely affixed to the parcel.
It is receommended that a duplicate of the address be inserted in every parcel, especially when the use of a tag for the address is rendered necessary by the packing or form of the parcel.
Parcels on which the name of the sender or of the addressee is
indicated merely by initials are not admitted, unless the initials are the adopted trade name of the sender or addressee which is generally understood.
Addresses in ordinary pencil are not admitted. However, addresses written in indelible pencil on a previously dampened surface are accepted.
2. Each parcel must be packed in such a manner that the contents are protected over the whole route, and in such a way as to prevent the contents from damaging other parcels or objects or injuring
postal agents. The packing must protect the contents sufficiently that, in case of rifling, the traces thereof may be easily discovered.
Insured parcels must be closed and securely sealed with wax or otherwise. Ordinary parcels may be sealed at the option of the sender, or careful tying is sufficient as a mode of closing.
As a protective measure, either Administration may require that a special imprint or mark of the sender appear on the wax or lead seals closing insured parcels mailed in its service.
1 So in original.

Oct. 29, 1936 BAHAMAS-PARCEL POST AGREEMENT- Dec. 21, 1936

1483

The Customs Administration of the country of destination is authorized to open the parcels in order to inspect the contents. To that end, the seals or any other fastenings may be broken. Parcels opened by the Customs must be refastened and also officially resealed, except in the case of ordinary parcels which were not sealed by the senders in the first instance.
3. Each insured parcel must bear on the address side an insurance number and must bear a label with the word "Insured" or this word
must be marked or stamped on the parcel. 4. For insured parcels, the amount of insured value must appear
on the parcel in currency of the country of origin, in Roman letters written out in full and in Arabic figures. Also, the exact weight of each parcel in pounds and ounces must be entered by the Adminis-
tration of origin ( a ) on the address side of the parcel and (b ) on the customs declaration in the place reserved for this purpose.
5. The labels or postage stamps affixed to insured parcels must be spaced so that they cannot serve to conceal injuries to the packing. Neither may they be folded over two faces of the wrapping so as to cover the edge.
6. Liquids and easily liquefiable substances must be sent in a double receptacle. Between the first (bottle, flask, box, etc. ) and the second (box of metal, strong wood, strong corrugated cardboard or strong carton of fibre-board, or receptacle of equal strength ) , there must be left a space to be filled with sawdust, bran or other absorbent material, in sufficient quantity to absorb all the liquid in case that the receptacle is broken.
7. Powders and dyes in powder form must be packed in strong boxes of tin or other metal, which , after soldering, must be placed in turn in substantial outer covers in such a way as to avoid all damage to other articles.
ARTICLE 3

Customs Declarations.

Customs 1. The sender shall prepare one customs declaration for each parcel tions. sent from either country, upon a special form provided for the purpose by the country of origin. The customs declaration shall give a general description of the parcel, an accurate statement in detail of its contents and value, date of mailing, gross and net weight, the sender's name and address, and the name and address of the addressee, and shall be securely attached to the parcel. However, as an exception to the foregoing, when more than one parcel is mailed simultaneously by the same sender in the United States of America to the same addressee at the same address in the Bahamas and vice versa, the sender need prepare only one customs declaration for the entire shipment , which customs declaration shall show, in addition to the particulars set forth in the preceding paragraph, the total number of parcels comprising the shipment, and shall be securely attached to one of the parcels. The parcels com-
prising the entire shipment shall be clearly marked in such case with a fractional number, the numerator of which will indicate , in Arabic figures, the number of the parcel and the denominator the number of parcels comprising the shipment ; for example : If a single shipment were composed of 15 parcels each parcel would be numbered , respectively, 1/15 , 2/15 , 3/15 , etc.
2. The Administrations accept no responsibility for the correctness of the customs declarations.

If the form does not reach the office of destination, that office makes out a duplicate.
2. The office of destination , after having duly filled out the return receipt form, returns it free of postage to the address of the sender of the parcel.
3. When the sender applies for a return receipt after a parcel has been mailed, the office of origin duly fills out a return receipt form and attaches it to a form of inquiry which is entered with the details concerning the transmission of the parcel and then forwards it to the office of destination of the parcel. In the case of the due delivery of the parcel, the office of destination withdraws the inquiry form, and the return receipt is treated in the manner prescribed in the foregoing Section.
ARTICLE 5

3. In case ten per cent of the total number of bags used during the year have not been returned , the value of the missing bags must be repaid to the Administration of origin.

ARTICLE 6

Oct. 29 , 1936 BAHAMAS-PARCEL POST AGREEMENT- Dec. 21, 1936
2. The ordinary parcels included in each dispatch to the United States of America are to be entered on the parcel bills to show the total number of parcels and the total net weight thereof. The ordinary parcels included in each dispatch to the Bahamas are to be entered on the parcel bills to show the total number of parcels.
3. Insured parcels shall be entered individually on the parcel bills to show the insurance number and the name of the office of origin. In the case of insured parcels for the United States of America, the total net weight of the parcels must also be shown.
4. Parcels sent " dcouvert" must be entered separately on the parcel bills.
5. Returned or redirected parcels must be entered individually on the parcel bills and be followed by the word "Returned " or "Redirected" as the case may be. A statement of the charges which may be due on these parcels should be shown in the "Observations" column .

The exact method of advising parcels or the receptacles containing them sent by one Administration in transit through the other, together with any details of procedure in connection with the advice of such parcels or receptacles for which provision is not made in this Agreement, shall be settled by mutual consent through correspondence between the two Administrations.
ARTICLE 8

1485

Verification by the Exchange Office .

1. Upon receipt of a dispatch, the exchange office of destination proceeds to verify it. The entries in the parcel bill must be verified exactly. Each error or omission must be brought immediately to the knowledge of the dispatching exchange office by means of a bulletin of verification. A dispatch is considered as having been found in order in all regards when no bulletin of verification is made up.
If any error or irregularity is found upon receipt of a dispatch, all objects which may serve later on for investigations, or for examination of requests for indemnity, must be kept.
2. The dispatching exchange office to which a bulletin of verification is sent returns it after having examined it and entered thereon its observations, if any. That bulletin is then attached to the parcel bills of the parcels to which it relates. Corrections made on a parcel bill which are not justified by supporting papers are considered as devoid of value.

Verification by ex change office.

3. If necessary, the dispatching exchange office may also be advised by telegram, at the expense of the Office sending such telegram .
4. In case of shortage of a parcel bill, a duplicate is prepared , a

copy of which is sent to the exchange office of origin of the dispatch. 5. The office of exchange which receives from a corresponding

office a parcel which is damaged or insufficiently packed must redispatch such parcel after repacking, if necessary, preserving the original packing as far as possible.
If the damage is such that the contents of the parcel may have been abstracted, the office must first officially open the parcel and verify its contents.

1486

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES
In either case, the weight of the parcel will be verified before and after repacking, and indicated on the wrapper of the parcel itself. That indication will be followed by the note "Repacked at  ."," and the signature of the agents who have effected such repacking.

Fixing of Responsibility.

Fixing of responsibility.

1. Until the contrary is proved, responsibility for an insured parcel rests with the Administration which, having received the parcel without making any reservations, and being put in possession of all the regulation means of investigation, cannot establish the disposal of the parcel.
2. When the loss , rifling, or damage of an insured parcel is detected upon opening the receptacle at the receiving exchange office and has been regularly pointed out to the dispatching exchange office , the responsibility falls on the Administration to which the latter office belongs, unless it be proved that the irregularity occurred in the service of the receiving Administration .
3. If the loss, rifling or damage has taken place in the course of transportation, without its being possible to establish on the territory or in the service of which country the act took place, the Offices involved bear the loss in equal shares.
4. The Administration paying compensation takes over, to the extent of the amount paid, the rights of the person who has received it, in any action which may be taken against the addressee, the sender or a third party.
5. If a parcel which has been regarded as lost is subsequently found, the person to whom compensation has been paid must be informed that he is at liberty to take possession of the parcel against repayment of the amount of compensation .

When the reforwarding involves the dispatch of a parcel to a third country and if the amount credited to the retransmitting Administration is insufficient to cover the expenses of retransmission which it has to defray, the retransmitting Administration allows to the Administration to which it forwards the parcel the credits due it ; it then recovers the amount of the deficiency by claiming it from the office of exchange from which the missent parcel was directly received. The reason for this claim is notified to the latter by means of a Bulletin of Verification.

the charges prescribed by Section 1 above ; (b) the delivery, customs clearaacntces aanndd ssttoorraage charges provided for by Articles XIV, XV and XVI ; (c) the charges for reforwarding or return. In case of reforwarding or return to a third country, the accrued charges, that is, such of the charges mentioned in (a ) , (b ) , and (c) above as are applicable, shall follow the parcel, but in the case that the third country concerned refuses to assume the charges because they cannot be collected from the addressee or sender, as the case may be, or for any other reason , they shall be charged back to the country of origin. In case of a parcel returned or reforwarded in transit through one of the two Administrations to or from the other, the intermediary
Administration may claim also the sum due to it for any additional territorial or sea service provided, together with any amounts due to any other Administration or Administrations concerned.

DETAILED REGULATIONS FOR THE EXECUTION OF THE PARCEL POST AGREEMENT.

Regulations for execution.

The following Detailed Regulations for the Execution of the Parcel Post Agreement have been agreed upon by the Chiefs of the Postal Administrations of the United States of America and of Gibraltar.
ARTICLE 1 .

Limits of Weight and Size.

Limits and size.

of weight

The parcels to be exchanged under the provisions of this Agreement may not exceed 22 pounds ( 10 kilograms ) in weight nor the following dimensions :

Greatest length 4 feet, on condition that parcels over 42 inches but not over 44 inches long do not exceed 24 inches in girth ; that parcels over 44 inches but not over 46 inches long do not exceed 20

inches in girth ; that parcels over 46 inches but not over 48 inches long do not exceed 16 inches in girth ; and that parcels which are

312 feet or less in length do not exceed 6 feet in length and girth

(taken in a direction other than that of the length ) combined.

The limit of weight and maximum dimensions stated above may

be changed from time to time by agreement made through corre-

spondence .

ARTICLE 2.

Preparation of Parcels.

Preparation of par cels .

1. The name and address of the sender and of the addressee must
be written, legibly and correctly, on the parcel itself if possible, or on a label or tag affixed securely to the parcel.
It is recommended that a duplicate of the address be inserted in every parcel, especially when the use of a tag for the address is rendered necessary by the packing or form of the parcel.
Parcels on which the name of the sender or of the addressee is

indicated merely by initials are not admitted , unless the initials are the adopted trade name of the sender or addressee which is generally understood.
Addresses in pencil are not admitted. However, addresses written in indelible pencil on a previously dampened surface are accepted .
2. Each parcel must be packed in such a manner that the contents are protected over the whole route, and in such a way as to prevent the contents from damaging other parcels or objects or injuring postal agents. The packing must protect the contents sufficiently that, in case of rifling, the traces thereof may be easily discovered .

Ordinary parcels may be sealed at the option of the sender, or careful tying is sufficient as a mode of closing. Insured parcels must be sealed by means of wax, by lead or other seals.
As a protective measure, either Administration may require that special imprints or marks of the senders appear on the wax or lead seals closing insured parcels.

Dec. 18, 1936 GIBRALTAR-PARCEL POST AGREEMENT- Jan. 5 , 1937

1499

The Customs Administration of the country of destination is authorized to open the parcels. To that end, the seals or any other fastenings may be broken. Parcels opened by the Customs must be refastened and also officially resealed.
3. Each insured parcel must bear on the address side an insurance number and must bear a label with the words "Insured" or "Valeur
dclare".
4. For insured parcels, the amount of insured value must appear on the parcel in the currency of the country of origin, in Roman characters written in full and in Arabic figures. Also, the exact weight of each parcel in pounds and ounces must be entered by the Administration of origin (a ) on the address side of the parcel and (b) on the customs declaration in the place reserved for this
purpose. 5. The labels or postage stamps affixed to insured parcels must be
spaced so that they cannot serve to conceal injuries to the packing. Neither may they be folded over two faces of the wrapping so as to cover the edge.
6. Liquids and easily liquefiable substances must be sent in a double receptacle. Between the first (bottle, flask, box, etc. ) and the second (box of metal , strong wood, or strong carton of fiberboard , or receptacle of equal strength ) , there must be left a space to be filled with sawdust, bran or other absorbent material, in sufficient quantity to absorb all the liquid in case that the receptacle is broken.
7. Powders and dyes in powder form must be packed in strong boxes of tin or other metal, which, after soldering, must be placed in turn in substantial outer covers in such a way as to avoid all damage to other articles.
ARTICLE 3.

Customs Declarations.

1. The sender shall prepare one customs declaration for each parcel sent from either country, upon a special form provided for the purpose by the country of origin.

tioCnus.stoms

declara-

The customs declaration shall give a general description of the parcel, an accurate statement in detail of its contents and value, date

of mailing, gross and net weight, the sender's name and address, and the name and address of the addressee, and shall be securely attached to the parcel.

However, as an exception to the foregoing, the use of only one customs declaration may be allowed for a single consignment of any number of uninsured parcels sent by the same sender to the same addressee at the same time. In this case the customs declaration shall

show, in addition to the particulars set forth in the preceding para-

graph, the total number of parcels comprising the shipment , and shall be securely attached to one of the parcels. The parcels comprising the entire shipment shall be clearly marked in such case with a fractional

number, the numerator of which will indicate, in Arabic figures, the number of the parcel, and the denominator the number of parcels

comprising the shipment ; for example, if a single shipment were

composed of 15 parcels, each parcel would be numbered , respectively, 1/15, 2/15, 3/15 , etc.

2. The Administrations accept no responsibility for the correctness of the customs declarations.

1500

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES

Return receipts.

ARTICLE 4.
Return Receipts.
1. As to a parcel for which a return receipt is asked, the office of origin places on the parcel the letters or words "A. R." or "Return receipt requested". The office of origin or any other office appointed by the dispatching Administration shall fill out a return receipt form and attach it to the parcel. If the form does not reach the office of destination, that office makes out a duplicate.
2. The office of destination, after having duly filled out the return receipt form, returns it free of postage to the address of the sender of the parcel.
3. When the sender applies for a return receipt after a parcel has been mailed , the office of origin duly fills out a return receipt form and attaches it to a form of inquiry which is entered with the details concerning the transmission of the parcel and then forwards it to the office of destination of the parcel. In the case of the due delivery of the parcel, the office of destination withdraws the inquiry form, and the return receipt is treated in the manner prescribed in the foregoing Section.
ARTICLE 5 .

Receptacles.

Receptacles.
1. The Postal Administrations of the two contracting countries shall provide the respective bags necessary for the dispatch of their parcels and each bag shall be marked to show the name of the office or country to which it belongs.

3. In case ten percent of the total number of bags used during the year have not been returned, the value of the missing bags must be repaid to the Administration of origin.
ARTICLE 6 .

Method of Exchange of Parcels.

Method of exchange of parcels.

1. The parcels shall be exchanged, in sacks duly fastened and sealed, by the Offices appointed by agreement between the two Administrations, and shall be dispatched to the country of destination by the country of origin at its cost and by such means as it provides.
2. Insured parcels shall be enclosed in separate sacks from those in which ordinary parcels are contained, and the labels of sacks containing insured parcels shall be marked with such distinctive symbols as may from time to time be agreed upon.

ARTICLE 7.

Billing of parcels.

Billing of Parcels.
1. Separate parcel bills must be prepared for the ordinary parcels on the one hand, and for the insured parcels on the other hand.
The parcel bills are prepared in duplicate. The original is sent in the regular mails, while the duplicate is inserted in one of the

Dec. 18, 1936 GIBRALTAR-PARCEL POST AGREEMENT-
Jan. 5 , 1937
sacks. The sack containing the parcel bill is designated by the letter "F" traced in a conspicuous manner on the label.
2. The ordinary parcels included in each dispatch sent to either country are to be entered on the parcel bills to show the total number of parcels and the total net weight thereof.
3. Insured parcels shall be entered individually on the parcel bills to show the insurance number and the name of the office of origin, as well as the total net weight of the parcels .
4. Parcels sent " dcouvert" must be entered separately on the parcel bills.
5. Returned or redirected parcels must be entered individually on the parcel bills and be followed by the word "Returned " or "Redirected", as the case may be. A statement of the charges which may be due on these parcels should be shown in the "Observations" column.
6. The total number of sacks comprising each dispatch must also be shown on the parcel bills.
7. Each dispatching exchange office numbers the parcel bills in the upper left-hand corner in accordance with an annual series. The last number of the preceding year must be mentioned on the first bill of the following year.
8. The exact method of advising parcels or the receptacles containing them sent by one Administration in transit through the other together with any details of procedure in connection with the advice of such parcels or receptacles for which provision is not made in this Agreement, shall be settled by mutual agreement through correspondence between the two Administrations.

1501

ARTICLE 8 .

Verification by the Exchange Offices.

1. Upon receipt of a dispatch, the exchange office of destination proceeds to verify it . The entries in the parcel bill must be verified exactly. Each error or omission must be brought immediately to the knowledge of the dispatching exchange office by means of a bulletin of verification. A dispatch is considered as having been found in order in all regards when no bulletin of verification is made up.

Verification by exchange offices.

If an error or irregularity is found upon receipt of a dispatch, all

objects which may serve later on for investigations, or for examination of requests for indemnity, must be kept.

2. The dispatching exchange office to which a bulletin of verification is sent, returns it after having examined it and entered thereon its

observations, if any. That bulletin is then attached to the parcel bills of the parcels to which it relates. Corrections made on a parcel bill

which are not justified by supporting papers are considered as devoid of value.

3. If necessary, the dispatching exchange office may also be advised by telegram, at the expense of the office sending such telegram.
4. In case of shortage of a parcel bill, a duplicate is prepared , a copy of which is sent to the exchange office of origin of the dispatch.
5. The office of exchange which receives from a corresponding office

a parcel which is damaged or insufficiently packed must redispatch

such parcel after repacking, if necessary, preserving the original packing as far as possible.

1502

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES

If the damage is such that the contents of the parcel may have been abstracted, the office must first officially open the parcel and verify its contents .
In either case, the weight of the parcel will be verified before and after repacking, and indicated on the wrapper of the parcel itself. That indication will be followed by the note "Repacked at and the signature of the agents who have effected such repacking.

These terminal charges may be reduced or increased on 3 months previous notice given by one country to the other. These reductions or increases shall hold good for at least one year.
2. The amounts to be allowed in respect to parcels sent from one Administration to the other for onward transmission to a possession of either country, or to a third country, shall be fixed by the intermediary Administration.
3. Except as provided in this Article, each Administration shall keep the whole of the sums which it collects by virtue of the various Articles of this Agreement.

WHEREAS it is provided in the Tariff Act of 1930 of the Congress of the United States of America, as amended by the Act of June 12 , 1934 , entitled "AN ACT To Amend the Tariff Act of 1930 " (48 Stat. 943) ,

as follows:

Statutory provisions.

"Sec. 350. (a) For the purpose of expanding foreign markets for the

products of the United States (as a means of assisting in the present

emergency in restoring the American standard of living, in overcoming

domestic unemployment and the present economic depression , in in-

creasing the purchasing power of the American public, and in estab-

lishing and maintaining a better relationship among various branches

of American agriculture, industry, mining, and commerce) by regulating the admission of foreign goods into the United States in accordance with the characteristics and needs of various branches of American

production so that foreign markets will be made available to those

branches of American production which require and are capable of developing such outlets by affording corresponding market oppor-

tunities for foreign products in the United States, the President,

whenever he finds as a fact that any existing duties or other import restrictions of the United States or any foreign country are unduly

burdening and restricting the foreign trade of the United States and

that the purpose above declared will be promoted by the means hereinafter specified, is authorized from time to time--
"(1) To enter into foreign trade agreements with foreign governments or instrumentalities thereof; and
"(2) To proclaim such modifications of existing duties and other

import restrictions, or such additional import restrictions, or such continuance, and for such minimum periods, of existing customs or excise treatment of any article covered by foreign trade agreements,

as are required or appropriate to carry out any foreign trade agreement that the President has entered into hereunder. No proclamation shall be made increasing or decreasing by more than 50 per centum any existing rate of duty or transferring any article between the

dutiable and free lists. The proclaimed duties and other import

restrictions shall apply to articles the growth, produce, or manufacture of all foreign countries, whether imported directly, or indirectly: Provided, That the President may suspend the application to articles

the growth, produce , or manufacture of any country because of its

forth in this section ; and the proclaimed duties and other import re-

strictions shall be in effect from and after such time as is specified in

the proclamation . The President ma3y9 at any time terminate any

such proclamation in whole or in part. '

WHEREAS I , Franklin D. Roosevelt, President of the United States trade

of America, have found as a fact that certain existing duties and other

import restrictions of the United States of America and the Kingdom

of the Netherlands are unduly burdening and restricting the foreign

trade of the United States of America and that the purpose declared in the said Tariff Act of 1930, as amended by the said Act of June 12 , 1934 , will be promoted by a foreign trade agreement between

1. Wheat flour:

SCHEDULE III

The Netherlands Government undertakes to purchase annually from mills in the United States of America a quantity of wheat flour equivalent to not less than five per centum of the annual total wheat flour consumption in the Netherlands, provided that the price of such wheat flour delivered in the Netherlands is competitive with the price of other foreign wheat flour of comparable grade and quality.

2. Milling wheat :
The Netherlands Government undertakes to purchase annually a quan-
tity of milling wheat originating in the United States of America equivalent to not less than five per centum of the annual total consumption of foreign milling wheat in the Netherlands, provided that the price of the milling wheat originating in the United States of America is competitive with the world price for milling wheat of comparable grade and quality .

Note 1. Of the total annual quantities of either milling wheat or wheat flour originating in the United States of America which the Netherlands Government undertakes to purchase pursuant to the foregoing provisions , onetwelfth part thereof will be purchased each month unless purchases for one or more months are made in advance. If in any month the prices of milling wheat or wheat flour originating in the United States of America are not competitive and for this reason the monthly purchases are smaller than those provided for above, the Netherlands Government shall not be obligated to compensate for such deficiency by correspondingly increased purchases in later months.
Note 2. The Netherlands Government will give sympathetic consideration to any representations which the Government of the United States of America may make with respect to any matter pertaining to the application of the provisions of this Schedule .

LIJST III

De Nederlandsche Regeering verbindt zich jaarlijks van molens in de
Vereenigde Staten van Amerika te koopen een hoeveelheid tarwebloem, overeenkomende met niet minder dan vijf percent van het totale jaarlijksche verbruik van tarwebloem in Nederland, mits de prijs van dergelijke tarwebloem, afgeleverd in Nederland , concurreerend is met den prijs van andere buitenlandsche tarwebloem van gelijksoortige hoedanigheid en kwaliteit.

2. Maaltarwe.

De Nederlandsche Regeering verbindt zich jaarlijks te koopen een hoeveelheid maaltarwe, van oorsprong uit de Vereenigde Staten van Amerika, overeenkomende met niet minder dan vijf percent van het totale jaarlijksche verbruik van buitenlandsche maaltarwe in Nederland, mits de prijs van de maaltarwe, van oorsprong uit de Vereenigde Staten van Amerika, concurreerend is met den wereldprijs voor maaltarwe van gelijksoortige hoedanigheid en kwaliteit.

Aanteekening 1. Van de totale jaarlijksche hoeveelheden maaltarwe of tarwebloem, van oorsprong uit de Vereenigde Staten van Amerika, tot welker aankoop de Nederlandsche Regeering zich overeenkomstig de hiervoor genoemde bepalingen verbindt, zal elke maand een twaalfde gedeelte worden aangekocht, tenzij voor een of meer maanden vooruit wordt gekocht. Indien in eenige maand de prijzen van maaltarwe of tarwebloem, van oorsprong uit de Vereenigde Staten van Amerika, niet concurreerend zijn en om deze reden de maandelijksche aankoopen kleiner zijn dan de hierboven aangeduide, zal de Nederlandsche Regeering niet verplicht zijn een zoodanig tekort aan te vullen door overeenkomstig verhoogde aankoopen in latere maanden.

Aanteekening 2. De Nederlandsche Regeering zal in welwillende overweging nemen de vertoogen, welke de Regeering van de Vereenigde Staten tot Haar

Washington, December 20, 1935.

I have the honor to make the following statement of my understanding of the agreement reached through recent conversations held at Washington by representatives of the Government of the United States and the Netherlands Government with reference to certain

special duties .

These conversations have disclosed a mutual understanding between the two Governments, which is that neither will impose on

products of territories of the other Government any antidumping duty or new or additional duty to countervail the payment or bestowal of a bounty or grant, without first giving the other Government, through an informal notice, an opportunity to present representations with respect to the proposed duty. No decision to impose such duty will be made within thirty days after the date of the informal notice, unless an earlier decision is required by law. Any representations

submitted by the other Government will be carefully considered by the Government contemplating the imposition of the duty.

gehouden besprekingen tusschen de vertegenwoordigers van de Nederlandsche Regeering en die van de Regeering van de Vereenigde Staten van Amerika.

Geen beslissing, ten aanzien van het opleggen van een zoodanig recht, zal worden genomen binnen dertig dagen na den datum van de hiervoor bedoelde informeele kennisgeving, tenzij de wet een vroegere beslissing vereischt . Elk, door de andere Regeering ingediend , vertoog zal door de Regeering, welke voornemens is tot de oplegging van bedoeld recht over te gaan, zorgvuldig in overweging worden genomen .
Ik heb de eer Uwer Excellentie de aldus bereikte overeenstemming te bevestigen .

cialist Republics.

One. The United States of America will grant to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics unconditional and unrestricted mostfavored-nation treatment in all matters concerning customs duties and charges of every kind and in the method of levying duties, and, further, in all matters concerning the rules, formalities, charges imposed in connection with the clearing of goods through the customs, and with respect to all laws or regulations affecting the sale or use of imported goods within the country.
Accordingly, natural or manufactured products having their origin in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics shall in no case be subject, in regard to the matters referred to above, to any duties, taxes or charges other or higher, or to any rules or formalities other or more burdensome, than those to which the like products having their origin in any third country are or may hereafter be subject.
Similarly, natural or manufactured products exported from the territory of the United States of America and consigned to the territory of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics shall in no case be subject with respect to exportation and in regard to the abovementioned matters, to any duties, taxes, or charges other or higher, or to any rules or formalities other or more burdensome, than those to which the like products when consigned to the territory of any third country are or may hereafter be subject.

Any advantage, favor, privilege or immunity which has been or may hereafter be granted by the United States of America in regard to the above-mentioned matters , to a natural or manufactured product originating in any third country or consigned to the territory of any third country shall be accorded immediately and without com-

pensation to the like product originating in or consigned to the territory of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

quettes, shall not apply to such products imported into the United States of America . If the law of the United States of America shall

not permit the complete operation of the foregoing provisions with

other military supplies. It is understood that any action which may be taken by the President of the United States of America under the authority of Section 2 (b ) of the Neutrality Act of 1937 in regard to the passage to title to goods shall not be considered as con-

travening any of the provisions of this agreement relating to the exportation of natural or manufactured products from the territory of the United States of America.

Subject to the requirement that no arbitrary discrimination shall be effected by the United States of America against importations from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and in favor of those from any third country, the foregoing provisions shall not extend to prohibitions or restrictions ( 1 ) imposed on moral or humanitarian grounds, (2 ) designed to protect human, animal, or plant life, (3 ) relating to prison-made goods , or (4) relating to the enforcement of police or revenue laws.

AMERICAN EDUCATION WEEK

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA A PROCLAMATION

September 30, 1936 [No. 2199]

American An opportunity for all of our people to obtain the education that tion Week. will best fit them for their life work and their responsibilities as citizens is the ideal of American education. It is an ideal which has been a
vital factor in our national development since 1647 when the General Court of Massachusetts enacted the historic measure providing for an
elementary school in every township of fifty householders and a grammar school in every town of one hundred families "to instruct youth so farr as they may be fited for ye university". In the expansion of the nation the school has moved with the frontier, and time and experience have demonstrated that universal education is essential to national progress .
It is accordingly with a feeling of earnest gratification that we note the improvement which has taken place with respect to the educational situation in the United States. Teaching positions which were eliminated during the depression years are being restored and teachers' salaries have returned to pre-depression levels in an encouraging number of school systems, colleges, and universities . There has been a steady increase in the attendance of students at elementary schools , high schools, and colleges .

CONTRIBUTIONS TO AMERICAN RED CROSS FOR FLOOD RELIEF

January 23, 1937 [No. 2222]

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA A PROCLAMATION

American Red Cross.

Disastrous floods in the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys already

have driven 270,000 men, women and children from their homes.

PROCLAMATIONS, 1937

1811

There is every likelihood that until the crest of the flood waters is

reached, this number of homeless refugees will be largely increased . Snow, sleet and freezing weather have added to the suffering and made more hazardous the work of rescue .

The victims of this grave disaster are dependent upon the American Red Cross for food , shelter, fuel, medical care and warm clothing.

I have instructed the various agencies of the Federal Government to cooperate to the fullest extent with the Red Cross authorities .

In order that the Red Cross may meet these immediate emergency needs and continue to care for these unfortunates until the waters

have receded and they can be returned to their homes , it is imperative

that a minimum relief fund of two million dollars be raised as speedily

as possible . We are looking to this great national relief agency to

act as our representative in this emergency.

As President of the United States and as President of the American
