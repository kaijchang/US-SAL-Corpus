Purpose of convention .

Reconnaissant la nécessité de

mieux assurer que par le passé

l'application équitable du droit aux relations maritimes interna-

tionales en temps de guerre ;

Estimant que, pour y parvenir, il convient , en abandonnant ou en conciliant le cas échéant dans un intérêt commun certaines pratiques divergentes anciennes, d'entreprendre de codifier dans des règles communes les garanties dues au commerce pacifique et au travail inoffensif, ainsi que la conduite des hostilités sur mer ; qu'il importe de fixer dans des engagements mutuels écrits les principes demeurés jusqu'ici dans le domaine incertain de la controverse ou laissés à l'arbitraire des Gouvernements ;

Plenipotentiaries.

Que, dès à présent, un certain nombre de règles peuvent être posées, sans qu'il soit porté atteinte au droit actuellement en vigueur concernant les matières qui n'y sont pas prévues ;
Ont nommé pour Leurs Plénipotentiaires, savoir:
SA MAJESTÉ L'EMPEREUR D'ALLEMAGNE, ROI DE PRUSSE :

Recognizing the necessity of more effectively ensuring than hitherto the equitable application of law to the international relations of maritime Powers in time of war;
Considering that, for this purpose, it is expedient, in giving up or, if necessary, in harmonizing for the common interest cer-
tain conflicting practices of long standing, to commence codifying in regulations of general application the guarantees due to peaceful commerce and legitimate business , as well as the conduct of hostilities by sea ; that it is expedient to lay down in written mutual engagements the principles which have hitherto remained in the uncertain domain of controversy or have been left to the discretion of Governments;
That, from henceforth, a certain number of rules may be made, without affecting the common law now in force with regard to the matters which that law has left unsettled ;
Have appointed the following as their Plenipotentiaries :
[Here follow the names of Plenipotentiaries .]

Provincial Governments on the other as the case may be, subject to any treaty provisions now existing with respect thereto, the exclusive jurisdiction and control over the use and diversion, whether temporary or permanent, of all waters on its own side of the line which in their natural channels would flow across the boundary or into boundary waters ; but it is agreed that any interference with or diversion from their natural channel of such waters on either side of the boundary, resulting in any injury on the other side of the boundary,
shall give rise to the same rights and entitle the injured parties to the same legal remedies as if such injury took place in the country where such diversion or interference occurs ; but this provision shall not apply to cases already existing or to cases expressly covered by special agreement between the parties hereto.
It is understood, however, that neither of the High Contracting ,inNjauvriegda.tion not tobe Parties intends by the foregoing provision to surrender any right, which it may have, to object to any interference with or diversions of waters on the other side of the boundary the effect of which would be productive of material injury to the navigation interests on its own side of the boundary.
ARTICLE III.
Further diversions, It is agreed that, in addition to the uses, obstructions, and diver- etc., subject to special sions heretofore permitted or hereafter provided for by special agree- agreement. ment between the Parties hereto, no further or other uses or obstructions or diversions, whether temporary or permanent, of boundary waters on either side of the line, affecting the natural level or flow of boundary waters on the other side of the line, shall be made except by authority of the United States or the Dominion of Canada within their respective jurisdictions and with the approval , as hereinafter
