State not to receive more land for school, &c. purposes

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United Slates of America in Congress assembled, That in all cases where the State of California has heretofore made selections of any portion of the public domain in part satisfaction of any grant made to said State by any act of Congress, and has disposed of the same to purchasers in good faith under her laws, the lands so selected shall be, and hereby are, confirmed to said State: Provided, That no selection made by said State contrary to existing laws shall be confirmed by this act for lands to which any adverse pre-emption, homestead, or other right has, at the date of the passage of this act, been acquired by any settler under the laws of the United States, or to any lands which have been reserved for naval, military, or Indian purposes by the United States, or to any mineral land, or to any land held or claimed under any valid Mexican or Spanish grant, or to any land which, at the time of the passage of this act, was included within the limits of any city, town, or village, or within the county of San Francisco: And providedfurther, That the State of California shall not re-

Sec . 2. And be it further enacted, That where the selections named in section one of this act have been made upon land which has been surveyed by authority of the United States, it shall be the duty of the proper authorities of the State, where the same has not already been done, to notify the register of the United States land office for the district in which the land is located of such selection, which notice shall be regarded as the date of the State selection, and the commissioner of the general land office shall, immediately after the passage of this act, instruct the several local registers to forward to the general land office, after investigation and decision, all such selections, which, if found to be in accordance with section one of this act, the commissioner shall certify over to the State in the usual manner.
Sec . 3. And be it further enacted, That where the selections named in section one of this act have been made from lands which have not been surveyed by authority of the United States, but which selections have been surveyed by authority of and under the laws of said State, and the land sold to purchasers in good faith under the laws of the State, such selections shall, from the date of the passage of this act, when marked off and designated in the field, have the same force and effect as the pre-emption rights of a settler upon unsurveyed public land; and if, upon survey of such lands by the United States, the lines of the two surveys shall be found not to agree, the selection shall be so changed as to include those legal subdivisions which nearest conform to the identical land included in the State survey and selection. Upon the filing with the register of
the proper United States land office of the township plat in which any such selection of unsurveyed land is located, the holder of the State title shall be allowed the same time to present and prove up his purchase and claim under this act as is allowed pre-emptors under existing laws ; and if found in accordance with section one of this act, the land embraced therein shall be certified over to the State by the commissioner of the general land office.
Sec . 4. And be it further enacted, That in all cases where township surveys have been, or shall hereafter be, made under authority of the

Sec . 6. And be it further enacted, That an act entitled " An act to provide for the survey of the public lauds in California, the granting of pre-emption rights therein, and for other purposes," approved March third, one thousand eight hundred and fifty-three, shall be construed as
giving the State of California the right to select for school purposes other lands in lieu of such sixteenth and thirty-sixth sections as were settled upon prior to survey, reserved for public uses, covered by grants made under Spanish or Mexican authority, or by other private claims, or where such sections would be so covered if the lines of the public surveys were extended over such lands, which shall be determined whenever' township lines shall have been extended over such land, and in rase of Spanish or Mexican grants, when the final survey of such grants shall have been made. The surveyor-general for the State of California shall furnish the State authorities with lists of all such sections so covered, as a basis of selection, such selections to be made from surveyed lands, and within the same land district as the section for which the selection is made.
Sec . 7. And be it further enacted, That where persons in good faith, and for a valuable consideration, have purchased lands of Mexican grantees or assigns, which grants have subsequently been rejected, or where the lands so purchased have been excluded from the final survey of any Mexican grant, and have used, improved, and continued in the actual possession of the same as according to the lines of their original purchase, and where no valid adverse right or title (except of the United States) exists, such purchasers may purchase the same, after having such lands surveyed under existing laws, at the minimum price established by law, upon first making proof of the facts as required in this section, under regulations to be provided by the commissioner of the general land office, joint entries being admissible by coterminous proprietors to such an extent as will enable them to adjust their respective boundaries : Provided, That the provisions of this section shall not be applicable to the city and county of San Francisco: Provided, That the right to purchase herein given shall not extend to lands containing mines of gold, silver, copper, or cinnabar : Provided, That whenever it shall be made to appear by petition from the occupants of such land that injury to permanent improvements would result from running the lines of the public surveys through such permanent improvements, the commissioner of the general land office may recognize existing lines of subdivisions.
Sec . 8. And be it further enacted, That in all cases where a claim to land by virtue of a right or title derived from the Spanish or Mexican authorities has been finally confirmed, and a survey and plat thereof shall not have been requested within ten months from the passage of this act, as provided by sections six and seven of the act of July first, eighteen hundred and sixty-four, "To expedite the settlement of titles to lands in the State of California," and in all cases where a like claim shall hereafter be finally confirmed, and a survey and plat thereof shall not be requested, as provided by said sections within ten months after the passage of this

claimants. Sec . 9. And be it further enacted, That from the decrees of the dis-
trict courts of the United States for the district of California, approving or correcting the surveys of private land claims under Spanish or Mexican grants, rendered after the first day of July, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-five, an appeal shall be allowed for the period of one year after the entry of such decrees to the circuit court of the United States for California, as provided by section three of the act of July first, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-four, to expedite the settlement of titles to land in the State of California, and the decision of the circuit court shall be final: Provided, however, That from decrees of the district courts, as aforesaid, made after July one, eighteen hundred and sixty-five, and prior to the passage of this act, an appeal may be taken to the United States circuit court for the State of California within one year from the approval

And be it further enacted, That the President of the United States shall cause the lauds to be surveyed for forty miles in width on both sides of the entire line of said road after the general route shall be fixed, and as fast as may be required by the construction of said railroad ; and the odd sections of land hereby granted shall not be liable to sale or entry, or pre-emption, before or after they are surveyed, except by said company, as provided in this act; but the provisions of the act of September, eighteen hundred and forty-one, granting pre-emption rights, and the acts amendatory thereof, and of the act entitled " An act to secure homesteads to actual settlers on the public domain," approved May twenty, eighteen hundred and sixty-two, shall be, and the same are hereby, extended to all other lands on the line of said road when surveyed, excepting those hereby granted to said company.
Sec . 7. And be it further enacted,, That the said Atlantic and Pacific Railroad Company be, and is hereby, authorized and empowered to enter upon, purchase, take, and hold any lands or premises that may be necessary and proper for the construction and working of said road, not exceeding in width one hundred feet on each side of the line of its railroad, unless a greater width be required for the purpose of excavation or embankment ; and also any lands or premises that may be necessary and proper for turn-outs, standing places for cars, depots, station-houses, or any other structures required in the construction and working of said road. And the said company shall have the right to cut and remove trees and other material that might, by falling, encumber its road-bed, though standing or being more than two hundred feet from the line of said road. And in case the owner of such lands or premises and the said company cannot agree as to the value of the premises taken, or to be taken, for the use of said road, the value thereof shall be determined by the appraisal of three disinterested commissioners, who may be appointed upon application by either party to any court of record in any of the Territories in which the lands or premises to be taken lie; and said commissioners, in their assessment of damages, shall appraise such premises at what would have been the value thereof if the road had not been built. And upon return into court of such appraisement, and upon the payment into the same of the estimated value of the premises taken for the use and benefit of the owner thereof, said premises shall be deemed to be taken by said company, which shall thereby acquire full title to the same for the purposes aforesaid. And either party feeling aggrieved at said appraisement may, within thirty days after the same has been returned into court, file an appeal therefrom, and demand a jury of twelve men to estimate the damage sustained; but such appeal shall not interfere with the rights of said company to enter upon the premises taken, or to do any act necessary and proper in the construction of its road. And said party appealing shall give bonds, with sufficient surety or sureties, for the payment of any cost that may arise upon such appeal; and in case the party appealing does not obtain a verdict more favorable, such party shall pay the whole cost incurred by the appellee, as well as his own, and the payment into court, for the use of the owner of said premises taken, at a sum equal to that finally awarded, shall be held to vest in said company the title of said land, and the right to use and occupy the same for the construction, maintenance, and operation of said road. And in case any of the lands to be taken as aforesaid shall be held by an infant, femme covert, non compos, insane person, or persons residing without the Territory within which the lands to be taken lie, or persons subjected to any legal disability, the court may appoint a guardian, for any party under any disqualification, to appear in proper person, who shall give bonds, with sufficient surety or sureties, for the proper and faithful execution of his trust, and who may

And in case it shall be ascertained that the annual list, or any other list, which may have been, or which shall hereafter be, delivered to any collector, is imperfect or incomplete in consequence of the omission of the names of any persons or parties liable to tax, or in consequence of any omission, or understatement, or undervaluation, or false or frau ulent statement contained in any return or returns made by any persons or parties liable to tax, the said assessor may, from time to time, or at any
time within fifteen months from the time of the passage of this act or from the time of the delivery of the list to the collector as aforesaid, enter on any monthly or special list the names of such persons or parties -o omitted, together with the amount of tax for which they may have been or shall become liable, and also the names of the persons or parties in respect to whose returns, as aforesaid, there has been or shall be any omission, undervaluation, understatement, or false or fraudulent statement, together with the amounts for which such persons or parties may be liable, over and above the amount for which they may have been, or shall be, assessed upon any return or returns made as aforesaid, and shall certify or return said list to the collector as required by law. And all provisions of law for the ascertainment of liability to any tax, or the assessment or collection thereof, shall be held to apply, as far as may be necessary to the proceedings herein authorized and directed. And wherever the word " duty " is used in this act, or the acts to which this is an amendment, it shall be constructed to mean " tax," whenever such
construction shall be necessary in order to effect the purposes of said acts.
That section twenty-one be amended by striking out the words " without having taken the oath or affirmation required by this act," and inserting in lieu thereof the words " without having taken the oath or affirmation required by law."
That section twenty-two be amended by striking out all after the enacting clause and inserting in lieu thereof the following: That there shall be allowed and paid to the several assessors a salary of fifteen hundred dollars per annum, payable quarterly ; and, in addition thereto, where the receipts of the collection district shall exceed the sum of one hundred thousand dollars, and shall not exceed the sum of four hundred thousand dollars annually, one half of one per centum upon the excess of receipts over one hundred thousand dollars. Where the receipts of a collection district shall exceed four hundred thousand dollars, and shall not exceed six hundred thousand, one fifth of one per centum upon the excess of receipts over four hundred thousand dollars. Where the receipts shall exceed six hundred thousand dollars, one tenth of one per centum upon such excess ; but the salary of no assessor shall in any case exceed the sum of four thousand dollars. And the several assessors shall be allowed and paid the sums actually and necessarily expended, with the approval of the commissioner of internal revenue, for office rent; but no account of such rent shall be allowed or paid until it shall have been verified in such manner as the commissioner shall require, and shall have been audited and approved by the proper officers of the Treasury Department. An I the several assessors shall be paid, after the account thereof shall have been rendered to and approved by the proper officers of the treasury, their necessary and reasonable charges for clerk-hire ; but no such a. count shall be approved unless it shall state the name or names of the clerk or clerks employed, and the precise periods of time for which they were respectively employed, and the rate of compensation agreed upon, and shall
be accompanied by an affidavit of the assessor stating that such service

was actually required by the necessities of his office, and was actually rendered, and also by the affidavit of each clerk, stating that he has rendered the service charged in such account on his behalf, the compensation agreed upon, and that, he has not paid, deposited or assigned, or contracted to pay, deposit, or assign any part of such compensation to the use of any other person, or in any way, directly or indirectly, paid or given, or contracted to pay or give, any reward or compensation for his office or employment, or the emoluments thereof; and the chief clerk of any such assessor is hereby authorized to administer, in the absence of the assessor, such oaths or affirmations as are required by this act. And there shall be allowed and paid to each assistant assessor four dollars for every day actually employed in collecting lists and making valuations, the number of days necessary for that purpose to be certified by the assessor, and three dollars for every hundred persons assefssejd contained in the tax list, as completed and delivered by him to the assessor, and twenty-five cents for each permit granted for making tobacco, snuff, or cigars ; and assistant assessors may be allowed, in the settlement of their accounts, such sum as the commissioner of internal revenue shall approve, not exceeding three hundred dollars per annum, for office rent; but no account for such rent shall be allowed or paid until it shall have been verified in such manner as the commissioner of internal revenue may require, and shall have been audited and approved by the proper officers of the Treasury Department; and assistant assessors, when employed outside of the town in which they reside, in addition to the compensation now allowed by law, shall, during such time so employed, receive one dollar per day; and the said assessors and assistant assessors, respectively, shall be paid, after the account thereof shall have been rendered to and approved by the proper officers of the treasury, their necessary and reasonable charges for stationery and blank books used in the discharge of their duties, and for postage actually paid on letters and documents received and sent, and relating exclusively to official business, and for money actually paid for publishing notices required by this act: Provided, That no such account shall be approved unless it shall state the date and the particular item of every such expenditure, and shall be verified by the oath or affirmation of such assessor or assistant assessor ; and the compensation herein specified shall be in full for all expenses not otherwise particularly authorized : Provided further, That the commissioner of internal revenue may, under such regulations as may be established by the Secretary of the Treasury, after due public notice, receive bids and make contracts for supplying stationery, blank books, and blanks to the assessors, assistant assessors, and collectors in the several collection districts : Provided further, That the Secretary of the Treasury shall be, and he is hereby, authorized to fix such additional rates of compensation to be made to assessors and assistant assessors in cases where a collection district embraces more than a single congressional district, and to assessors and assistant assessors, revenue agents, and inspectors in Louisiana, Georgia, South Carolina, Alabama, Florida, Texas, Arkansas, North Carolina, Mississippi, Tennessee, California, Nevada. and Oregon, and the Territories, as may appear to him to be just and equitable, in consequence of the greater cost of living and travellingin those States and Territories, and as may, in his judgment, be necessary to secure the services of competent officers ; but the compensation thus allowed shall not exceed the rate of five thousand dollars per annum. Collectors of internal revenue acting as disbursing officers shall be allowed all bills of assistant assessors heretofore paid by them in pursuance of the directions of the commissioner of internal revenue, notwithstanding the assistant assessor did not certify to hours therein, or that two dollars per diem was deducted from his salary or compensation before computation of the tax thereon.
That section twenty-four be amended by striking out the proviso there-

That section twenty-six be amended by striking out all after the enacting clause and inserting in lieu thereof the following: That in the adjust-
ment of the accounts of assessors and collectors of internal revenue which shall accrue after the thirtieth of June, eighteen hundred and sixty-four, and in the payment of their compensation for services after that date, the fiscal year of the treasury shall be observed ; and where such compensation, or any part of it, shall be by commissions upon assessments or collections, and shall during any year, in consequence of a new appointment, be due to more than one assessor or collector in the same district, such commissions shall be apportioned between such assessors or collectors ; but in no case shall a greater amount of the commissions be allowed to two or more assessors or collectors in the same district than is or may be authorized by law to be allowed to one assessor or collector. And the salary and commissions of assessors and collectors heretofore earned and accrued shall be adjusted, allowed, and paid in conformity to the provisions of this section, and not otherwise; but no payment shall be made to assessors or collectors on account of salaries or commissions without the certificate of the commissioner of internal revenue that all reports required by law oi' regulation have been received, or that a satisfactory explanation has been rendered to him of the cause of the delay.
That section twenty-eight be amended by striking out all after the enacting clause, and inserting in lieu thereof the following: That each of said collectors shall, within twenty days after receiving his annual collection list from the assessors, give notice, by advertisement in one newspaper published in each county in his collection district if there be any, and if not, then in a newspaper published in an adjoining county, and by notifications to be posted in at least four public places in each county in his collection district, that the said taxes have become due and payable, and state the time and place within said county at which he or his deputy will attend to receive the same, which time shall not be less than ten days after the date of such notification, and shall send a copy of such notice by mail to each postmaster in the county, to be posted in his office. And if any person shall neglect to pay, as aforesaid, for more than ten days, it shall be the duty of the collector or his deputy to issue to such person a notice, to be left at his dwelling or usual place of business, or be sent by mail, demanding the payment of said taxes, stating the amount thereof with a fee of twenty cents for the issuing and service of such notice, and with four cents for each mile actually and necessarily travelled in serving the same. And if such persons shall not pay the duties or taxes, and the fee of twenty cents and mileage as aforesaid, within ten days after the service or the sending by mail of such notice, it shall be the duty of the collector or his deputy to collect the said taxes and fee of twenty cents and mileage, with a penalty of ten per centum additional upon the amount of taxes. And with respect to all such taxes as are not included in the annual lists aforesaid, all taxes the collection of which is not otherwise provided for in this act, it shall be the duty of each collector, in person or by deputy, to give notice and demand payment thereof, in the manner last mentioned, within ten days from and after receiving the list thereof from the assessor, or within twenty days from and after the expiration of the time within which such tax should have been paid ; and if the annual

And in case of distraint, it shall be the duty of the officer charged with the collection to make, or cause to be made, an account of the goods or effects distrained, a copy of which, signed by the officer making such distraint, shall be left with the owner or possessor of such goods or effects, or at his or her dwelling or usual place of business, with some person of suitable age and discretion, if any such can be found, with a note of the sum demanded, and the time and place of sale ; and the said officer shall forthwith cause a notification to be published in some newspaper within the county wherein -said distraint is made, if there is a newspaper published in said county, or to be publicly posted at the post office, if there be one within five miles, nearest to the residence of the person whose property shall be distrained, and in not less than two other public places, which notice shall specify the articles distrained, and the time and place for the sale thereof, which time shall not be less than ten nor more than twenty days from the date of such notification to the owner or possessor of the property and the publication or posting of such notice as herein provided, and the place proposed for sale shall not be more than five miles distant from the place of making such distraint. And said sale may be adjourned from time to time by said officer, if he shall think it advisable to do so, but not for a time to exceed in all thirty days. And if any person, bank, association, company, or corporation, liable to pay any tax, shall neglect or refuse to pay the same after demand, the amount shall be a lien in favor of the United States from the time it was due until paid, with the interest, penalties, and costs that may accrue in addition thereto, upon all property and rights to property belonging to such person, bank, association, company, or corporation ; and the collector, after demand, may levy, or by warrant may authorize a deputy collector to levy, upon all property and rights to property belonging to such person, bank, association, company, or corporation, or on which the said lien exists, for the payment of the sum due as aforesaid, with interest and penalty for non-payment, and also of such further sum as shall be sufficient for the fees, costs and expenses of such levy. And in all cases of sale, as aforesaid, the certificate of such sale shall transfer to the purchaser all right, title and interest of such delinquent in and to the property sold ; and where such property shall consist of stocks, said certificate shall be notice, when received, to any corporation, company, or association of said transfer, and shall be authority to such corporation, company, or association to record the same on their books and records, in the same manner as if transferred or assigned by the person or party holding the same, in lieu of any original or prior certificates, which shall be void, whether cancelled or not. And said certificates, where the subject of sale shall be securities or other evidences of debt, shall be good and valid receipts to the person holding the same, as against any person holding, or claiming to hold, possession of such securities or other evidences of debt. And all persons, and officers of companies or corporations, are required, on demand of a collector or deputy collector about to distrain, or having distrained on any property or rights of property, to exhibit all books containing evidence or statements relating to the subject or subjects of distraint, or the property or rights of property liable to distraint for the tax so due as aforesaid : Provided, That in any case of distraint for the payment of the taxes aforesaid, the goods, chattels, or effects so distrained shall and may be restored to the owner or possessor, if, prior to the sale, payment of the amount due shall be made to the proper officer charged with the collection, together with the fees and other charges ; but in case of non-payment as

aforesaid, the said officers shall proceed to sell the said goods, chattels, or effects at public auction, and shall retain from the proceeds of such sale the amount demandable for the use of the United States, and a commission of five per centum thereon for his own use, with the fees and charges for distraint and sale, rendering the overplus, if any there be, to the person who may be entitled to receive the same: Provided further, That there shall be exempt from distraint and sale, if belonging to the head of a family, the school-books and wearing apparel necessary for such family; also arms for personal use, one cow, two hogs, five sheep and the wool thereof, provided the aggregate market value of said sheep shall not exceed fifty dollars ; the necessary food for such cow, hogs, and sheep for a period not exceeding thirty days; fuel to an amount not greater in value than twenty-five dollars ; provisions to an amount not greater than fifty dollars ; household furniture kept for use to an amount not greater than three hundred dollars ; and the books, tools, or implements of a trade or profession to an amount not greater than one hundred dollars shall also be exempt; and the officer making the distraint shall summon three disinterested householders of the vicinity, who shall appraise and set apart to the owner the amount of property herein declared to be exempt.
That section twenty-nine be amended by striking out all after the enacting clause and inserting in lieu thereof the following: That in all cases where property liable to distraint for taxes may not be divisible, so as to enable the collector by a sale of part thereof to raise the whole amount of the tax, with all costs, charges, and commissions, the whole of such property shall be sold, and the surplus of the proceeds of the sale, after satisfying the tax, costs, and charges, shall be paid to the person legally entitled to receive the same; or if he cannot be found, or refuse to receive the same, then such surplus shall be deposited in the treasury of the United States, to be there held for the use of the person legally entitled to receive the same, until he shall make application therefor to the Secretary of the Treasury, who, upon such application and satisfactory proofs in support thereof, shall, by warrant on the treasury, cause the same to be paid to the applicant. And if any of the property advertised for sale as aforesaid is of a kind subject to tax, and such tax has not been paid, and the amount bid for such property is not equal to the amount of such tax, the collector may purchase the same in behalf of the United States for an amount not exceeding the said tax. And in all cases where property subject to tax, but upon which the tax has not been paid, shall be seized upon distraint and sold, the amount of such tax shall, after deducting the expenses of such sale, be first appropriated out of the proceeds thereof to the payment of said tax. And if no assessment of tax has been made upon such property, the collector shall make a return thereof in the form required by law, and the assessor shall assess the tax thereon. And all property so purchased may be sold by said collector, under such regula-
tions as may be prescribed by the commissioner of internal revenue. And the collector shall render a distinct account of all charges incurred in the sale of such property to the commissioner of internal revenue, who shall by regulation determine the fees and charges to be allowed in all cases of distraint and other seizures ; or where necessary expenses for
making such distraint or seizure have been incurred, and in case of sale, the said collector shall pay into the treasury the surplus, if any there be, after defraying such fees and charges.
That section thirty be amended by striking out all after the enacting clause and inserting in lieu thereof the following: That in any case where goods, chattels, or effects sufficient to satisfy the taxes imposed by law
upon any person liable to pay the same shall not be found by the collector or deputy collector whose duty it may be to collect the same, he is hereby authorized to collect the same by seizure and sale of real estate; and the officer making such seizure and sale shall give notice to the person whose

estate is proposed to be sold, by giving him in hand, or leaving at his last or usual place of abode, if he has any such within the collection district where said estate is situated, a notice, in writing, stating what particular estate is proposed to be sold, describing the same with reasonable certainty, and the time when and place where said officer proposes to sell the same; which time shall not be less than twenty nor more than forty days from the time of giving said notice. And the said officer shall also cause a notification to the same effect to be published in some newspaper within the county where such seizure is made, if any such there be, and shall also cause a like notice to be posted at the post office nearest to the estate to be seized, and in two other public places within the county; and the place of said sale shall not be more than five miles distant from the estate seized, except by special order of the commissioner of internal revenue. At the time and place appointed, the officer making such seizure shall proceed to sell the said estate at public auction, offering the same at a minimum price, including the expense of making such levy, and all charges for advertising and an officer's fee of ten dollars. And in case the real estate so seized, as aforesaid, shall consist of several distinct tracts or parcels, the officer making sale thereof shall offer each tract or parcel for sale separately, and shall, if he deem it advisable, apportion the expenses, charges, and fees, aforesaid, to such several tracts or parcels, or to any of them, in estimating the minimum price aforesaid. And if no person offers for said estate the amount of said minimum price, the officer shall declare the same to be purchased by him for the United States, and shall deposit with the district attorney of the United States a deed thereof, as hereinafter specified and provided; otherwise, the same shall be declared to be sold to the highest bidder. And said sale may be adjourned from time to time by said officer for not exceeding thirty days in all, if he shall think it advisable so to do. If the amount bid shall not be then and there paid, the officer shall forthwith proceed to again sell said estate in the same manner; and upon any sale and the payment of the purchase money shall give to the purchaser a certificate of purchase, which shall set forth the real estate purchased, for whose taxes the same was sold, the name of the purchaser and the price paid therefor; and if the said real estate be not redeemed in the manner and within the time hereinafter provided, then the said collector or deputy collector shall execute to the said purchaser, upon his surrender of said certificate, a deed of the real estate purchased by him as aforesaid, reciting the facts set forth in said certificate, and in accordance with the laws of the State in which such real estate is situate upon the subject of sales of real estate under execution, which said deed shall be prima facie evidence of the facts therein stated; and if the proceedings of the officer as set forth have been substantially in accordance with the provisions of law, shall be considered and operate as a conveyance of all the right, title, and interest the party delinquent had in ami to the real estate thus sold at the time the lien of the United States attached thereto. Any person, whose estate may be proceeded against as aforesaid, shall have the right to pay the amount due, together with the costs and charges thereon, to the collector or deputy collector at any time prior to the sale thereof, and till further proceedings shall cease from the time of such payment. The owners of any real estate sold as aforesaid, their heirs, executors, or administrators, or any person having any interest therein, or a lien thereon, or any person in their
behalf, shall be permitted to redeem the land sold as aforesaid, or any particular tract thereof, at any time within one year after the sale thereof, upon payment to the purchaser, or, in case he cannot be found in the county in which the land to be redeemed is situate, then to the collector of the district in which the land is situate, for the use of the purchaser, his heirs or assigns, the amount paid by the said purchaser and interest thereon at the rate of twenty per centum per annum.

And whereas the United States, in accordance with their settled habits and policy, are a neutral power in regard to the war which thus afflicts the Republic of Mexico;
And whereas it has become known that one of the belligerents in the said war, namely, the Prince Maximilian, who asserts himself to be Emperor in Mexico, has issued a decree in regard to the port of Matamoras, and other Mexican ports which are in the occupation and possession of another of the said belligerents, namely, the United States of Mexico, which decree is in the following words: --
" The port of Matamoras, and all those of the northern frontier which have withdrawn from their obedience to the government, are closed to foreign and coasting traffic during such time as the empire of the law shall not be therein reinstated.
" Art . 2d. Merchandise proceeding from the said ports, on arriving at any other where the excise of the Empire is collected, shall pay the duties on importation, introduction, and consumption ; and on satisfactory proof of contravention shall be irremissibly confiscated. Our Minister of the Treasury is charged with the punctual execution of this decree.
" Given at Mexico, the 9th of July, 1866." And whereas the decree thus recited, by declaring a belligerent blockade unsupported by competent military or naval force, is in violation of the neutral rights of the United States, as defined by the law of nations, as well as of the treaties existing between the United States of America and the aforesaid United States of Mexico : Now, therefore, I, Andre w Joh ns on , President of the United States, do hereby proclaim and declare, that the aforesaid decree is held, and will be held, by the United States to be absolutely null and void, as against the government and citizens of the United States ; and that any attempt which shall be made to enforce the same against the government or the citizens of the United States will be disallowed. In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.

Seminole Indians, by their chiefs, John Chup-co, or Long John, Chocote-harjo, Fos-ha[r]-jo, John F. Brown.

PREAMBLE.

Whereas existing treaties between the United States and the Seminole nation are insufficient to meet their mutual necessities; and whereas the Seminole nation made a treaty with the so-called confederate states, August 1st, 1861, whereby they threw off their allegiance to the United States, and unsettled their treaty relations with the United States, and thereby incurred the liability of forfeiture of all lands and other property held by grant or gift of the United States ; and whereas a treaty of peace and amity was entered into between the United States and the Seminole and other tribes at Fort Smith, September 10, 1865, whereby the Seminoles revoked, cancelled, and repudiated the said treaty with the so-called confederate states; and whereas the United States, through its commissioners, in said treaty of peace, promised to enter into treaty with the Seminole nation to arrange and settle all questions relating to and growing out of said treaty with the so-called confederate states ; and whereas the United States, in view of said treaty of the Seminole nation with the enemies of the government of the United States, and the consequent liabilities of said Seminole nation, and in view of its urgent necessities for more lands in the Indian territory, requires a cession by said Seminole nation of a part of its present reservation, and is willing to pay therefor a reasonable price, while at the same time providing new and adequate lands for them.
Now, therefore, the United States, by its commissioners aforesaid, and the above-named delegates of the Seminole nation, the day and year above written, mutually stipulate and agree, on behalf of the respective parties, as follows, to wit: --
Art ic le I. There shall be perpetual peace between the United States and the Seminole nation, and the Seminoles agree to be and remain firm allies of the United States, and always faithfully aid the government thereof to suppress insurrection and put down its enemies.

Peace ana friendship.

offences against their government, and no Indian or Indians shall be pro-

scribed, or any act of forfeiture or confiscation passed against those who

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: April 2, 1868.

A PROCLAMATION.

Wher eas , by proclamations of the fifteenth and nineteenth of April, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-one, the President of the United States, in virtue of the power vested in him by the Constitution and the laws, declared that the laws of the United States were opposed, and the execution thereof obstructed, in the States of South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas, by combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course ofjudicial proceedings, or by the powers vested in the marshals by law;
And whereas, by another proclamation, made on the sixteenth day of August, in the same year, in pursuance of an act of Congress approved July thirteen, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-one, the inhabitants of the States of Georgia, South Carolina, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama, Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Florida (except the inhabitants of that part of the State of Virginia lying west of the Alleghany Mountains, and of such other parts of that State and the other States before named, as might maintain a loyal adhesion to the Union and the Constitution, or might be from time to time occupied and controlled by forces of the United States engaged in the dispersion of insurgents) were declared to be in a state of insurrection against the United States;
And whereas, by another proclamation, of the first day of July, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-two, issued in pursuance of an act of Congress approved June seven, in the same year, the insurrection was declared to be still existing in the States aforesaid, with the exception of certain specified counties in the State of Virginia;
And whereas, by another proclamation, made on the second day of April, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, in pursuance of the act of Congress of July thirteen, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-one, the exceptions named in the proclamation of August sixteen, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-one were revoked, and the inhabitants of the States of Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama, Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas, Mississippi, Florida, and Virginia (except the forty-eight counties of Virginia designated as West Virginia, and the ports of New Orleans, Key West, Port Royal, and Beaufort, in North Carolina) were declared to be still in a state of insurrection against the United States;
And whereas the House of Representatives, on the twenty-second day of July, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-one, adopted a resolution in the words following, namely : --
" Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Congress of the United States, That the present deplorable civil war has been forced upon the country by the disunionists of the southern States, now in revolt against the Constitutional government, and in arms around the capital; that in this national emergency, Congress, banishing all feelings of mere passion or resentment, will recollect only its duty to the whole country ; that this war is not waged upon our part in any spirit of oppression nor for any purpose of conquest or subjugation, nor purpose of overthrowing or interfering with the rights or established institutions of those States, but to defend and maintain the supremacy of the Constitution, and to preserve the Union with all the dignity, equality, and rights of the several States unimpaired; and that as soon as these objects are accomplished the wai' ought to cease."

APPENDIX

Preamble.

And whereas the Senate of the United States, on the twenty-fifth day of

July, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-one, adopted a resolution in the

words following, to wit: --

" Resolved, That the present deplorable civil war has been forced upon the

country by the disunionists of the Southern States, now in revolt against the

Constitutional government, and in arms around the capital; that in this na-

tional emergency, Congress, banishing all feeling of mere passion or resentment,

will recollect only its duty to the whole country; that this war is not prosecuted

upon our part in any spirit of oppression nor for any purpose of conquest or sub-

jugation, nor purpose of overthrowing or interfering with the rights or estab-

lished institutions of those States, but to defend and maintain the supremacy of

the Constitution and all laws made in pursuance thereof, and to preserve the

Union with all the dignity, equality, and rights of the several States unim-

paired ; that as soon as these objects are accomplished the war ought to cease."

And whereas these resolutions, though not joint or concurrent in form, are

substantially identical, and as such may be regarded as having expressed the

sense of Congress upon the subject to which they relate;

Vo1. xiii. p. 763. And whereas, by my proclamation of the thirteenth day of June last, the in-

surrection in the State of Tennessee was declared to have been suppressed, the

authority of the United States therein to be undisputed, and such United States

officers as had been duly commissioned to be in the undisturbed exercise of

their official functions;

And whereas there now exists no organized armed resistance of misguided

citizens or others to the authority of the United States in the States of Georgia,

South Carolina, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama, Louisiana, Ar-

kansas, Mississippi, and Florida, and the laws can be sustained and enforced

therein by the proper civil authority, State or Federal, and the people of said

States are well and loyally disposed, and have conformed or will conform in their

legislation to the condition of affairs growing out of the amendment to the Con-

stitution of the United States, prohibiting slavery within the limits and jurisdic-

tion of the United States;

And whereas, in view of the before-recited premises, it is the manifest deter-

mination of the American people that no State, of its own will, has the right or

the power to go out of, or separate itself from, or be separated from the Ameri-

can Union, and that therefore each State ought to remain and constitute an in-

tegral part of the United States ;

And whereas the people of the several before-mentioned States have, in the

manner aforesaid, given satisfactory evidence that they acquiesce in this sove-

reign and important resolution of national unity ;

And whereas it is believed to be a fundamental principle of government that

people who have revolted, and who have been overcome and subdued, must

either be dealt with so as to induce them voluntarily to become friends, or else

they must be held by absolute military power, or devastated, so as to prevent

them from ever again doing harm as enemies, which last-named policy is abhor-

rent to humanity and to freedom;

And whereas the Constitution of the United States provides for constitu-

ent communities only as States, and not as Territories, dependencies, provinces,

or protectorates;

And whereas such constituent States must necessarily be, and by the Consti-

tution and laws of the United States are made equals, and placed upon a like

footing as to political rights, immunities, dignity, and power with the several

States with which they are united ;

And whereas the observance of political equality as a principle of right and

justice is well calculated to encourage the people of the aforesaid States to be and

become more and more constant and persevering in their renewed allegiance;

And whereas standing armies, military occupation, martial law, military tri-

bunals, and the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus are, in

time of peace, dangerous to public liberty, incompatible with the individual

rights of the citizen, contrary to the genius and spirit of our free institutions,

and exhaustive of the national resources, and ought not, therefore, to be sanc-

tioned or allowed, except in cases of actual necessity, for repelling invasion or

suppressing insurrection or rebellion ;

And whereas the policy of the government of the United States, from the be-

ginning of the insurrection to its overthrow and final suppression, has been in

conformity with the principles herein set forth and enumerated;

Now, therefore, I, Andrew Johns on , president of the United States, do

hereby proclaim and declare that the insurrection which heretofore existed in

A PROCLAMATION.

Where as it has become known to me that certain evil-disposed persons have, within the territory and jurisdiction of the United States, begun and set on foot and have provided and prepared and are still engaged in providing and preparing means for a military expedition and enterprise, which expedition and enterprise is to be carried on from the territory and jurisdiction of the United States against colonies, districts and people of British North America within the dominions of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, with which said colonies, districts and people and Kingdom the United States are at peace;
And whereas the proceedings aforesaid constitute a high misdemeanor, forbidden by the laws of the United States as well as by the law of nations :
Now, therefore, for the purpose of preventing the carrying on of the unlawful expedition and enterprise aforesaid from the territory and jurisdiction of the United States and to maintain the public peace, as well as the national honor, and enforce obedience and respect to the laws of the United States, I, Andre w Joh nso n , President of the United States, do admonish and warn all good citizens of the United States against taking partin or in anywise aiding, countenancing or abetting said unlawful proceedings ; and I do exhort all judges, magistrates, marshals and officers in the service of the United States to employ all their lawful authority and power to prevent and defeat the aforesaid unlawful proceedings, and to arrest and bring to justice all persons who may be engaged therein.
And pursuant to the act of Congress in such case made and provided, I do furthermore authorize and empower Major-General George G. Meade, Commander of the Military Division of the Atlantic, to employ the land and naval forces of the United States and the militia thereof, to arrest and prevent the setting on foot and carrying on the expedition and enterprise aforesaid.
In testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.

Whereupon all of the minor children of those who have become citizens shall be construed to have elected to sever their connection with said tribe for the time being, and be entitled to their just proportion of the annuities of the tribe, to be paid to the head of the family to be expended for their support and education until they shall attain the age of twenty-one years, after which each shall elect to remove to his tribe or to become a citizen of the United States, as hereinbefore provided, and if thus admitted to citizenship, shall be entitled to all the privileges and interests herein provided for the head of the family.

protect, preserve, and defend them in all their just rights.

Arti cle XII. It is also agreed that if the said Secretary should not

be able to sell the said lands as hereinbefore provided, he may cause the

same to be appraised, in separate tracts, at their fair cash value, no tract

to be valued at less than two dollars and fifty cents per acre, and the same

a full settlement of all claims against the government for depredations

upon timber to the date of the signing of this treaty; and the Delawares

shall receive, without cost, from the United States, land included within

their new reservation to the amount of twenty-three sections, in place of

the twenty-three sections of half-breed Kaw lands referred to in said

sixth section of the treaty of eighteen hundred and sixty; and inasmuch

as the Delawares claim that a large amount of stock has been stolen from

them by whites since the treaty of eighteen hundred and fifty-four, the

United States agree to have a careful examination of such claims made

under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, and when the value

of such stolen stock shall have been ascertained, the same shall be re-

ported to Congress with a recommendation for an appropriation to pay for

the same; and all moneys appropriated for such purpose shall be paid to

the owners of said stock.

Art ic le XV. It is also agreed by the contracting parties that noth-

ing contained in this treaty shall be so construed as to require the Dela-

wares to remove from their present homes, until after they shall have

selected and received title to lands for new homes elsewhere.

In testimony whereof, the said superintendent, agent, and special com-

missioner, on behalf of the United States, and the said chiefs and council-

Contracting parties.

pre amb le .

Whe rea s existing treaties between the United States and the Creek

Nation have become insufficient to meet their mutual necessities; and

whereas the Creeks made a treaty with the so-called confederate

states, on the tenth of July, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-one,

whereby they ignored their allegiance to the United States, and unset-

tled the treaty relations existing between the Creeks and the United

States, and did so render themselves liable to forfeit to the United

States all benefits and advantages enjoyed by them in lands, annuities,

protection, and immunities, including their lands and other property

held by grant or gift from the United States; and whereas in view of

said liabilities the United States require of the Creeks a portion of

their land whereon to settle other Indians; and whereas a treaty of

peace and amity was entered into between the United States and the

Creeks and other tribes at Fort Smith, September tenth, eighteen hun-

dred and sixty-five, whereby the Creeks revoked, cancelled, and repu-

diated the aforesaid treaty made with the so-called confederate states;

and whereas the United States, through its commissioners, in said

treaty of peace and amity, promised to enter into treaty with the

Creeks to arrange and settle all questions relating to and growing out

of said treaty with the so-called confederate states: Now, therefore,

TREATY WITH THE CREEK INDIANS. June 14, 1866.

of the Creek Nation, the day and year above mentioned, mutually stipulate and agree, on behalf of the respective parties, as follows, to wit : --

Peace and friendship.
Military occupation and protection by the United States.
Amnesty.
Slavery not to exist among the Creeks.
Eights of those of African descent.
Cession of lands to the United States.
Payments therefor, and mode of payment.
Amendment. Post, p. 791.

Arti cle I. There shall be perpetual peace and friendship between the parties to this treaty, and the Creeks bind themselves to remain firm allies and friends of the United States, and never to take up arms against the United States, but always faithfully to aid in putting down its enemies. They also agree to remain at peace with all other Indian tribes; and, in return, the United States guarantees them quiet possession of their country, and protection against hostilities on the part of other tribes.
In the event of hostilities, the United States agree that the tribe commencing and prosecuting the same, shall, as far as may be practicable, make just reparation therefor. To insure this protection, the Creeks agree to a military occupation of their country, at any time, by the United States, and the United States agree to station and continue in said country from time to time, at its own expense, such force as may be necessary for that purpose. A general amnesty of all past offences against the laws of the United States, committed by any member of the Creek Nation, is hereby declared. And the Creeks, anxious for the restoration of kind and friendly feelings among themselves, do hereby declare an amnesty for all past offences against their government, and no Indian or Indians shall be proscribed, or any act of forfeiture or confiscation passed against those who have remained friendly to, or taken up arms against, the United States, but they shall enjoy equal privileges with other members of said tribe, and all laws heretofore passed inconsistent herewith are
hereby declared inoperative. Arti cle IL The Creeks hereby covenant and agree that henceforth

NATIONAL THANKSGIVING.

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES [OF AMERICA:] Oct. 8, 1866.

A PROCLAMATION.

Almig ht y God , our heavenly Father, has been pleased to vouchsafe to us, as a people, another year of that national life which is an indispensable condition of peace, security, and progress. That year has, moreover, been crowned with many peculiar blessings.
The civil war that so recently closed among us has not been anywhere reopened. Foreign intervention has ceased to excite alarm or apprehension. Intrusive pestilence has been benignly mitigated. Domestic tranquillity has improved, sentiments of conciliation have largely prevailed, and affections of loyalty and patriotism have been widely renewed. Our fields have yielded quite abundantly. Our mining industry has been richly rewarded, and we have been allowed to extend our railroad system far into the interior recesses of the country, while our commerce has resumed its customary activity in foreign seas.

These great national blessings demand a national acknowledgment.

Now, therefore, I, And rew Joh ns on , President of the United States, do

hereby recommend that Thursday, the twenty-ninth day of November next, be

set apart and be observed everywhere in the several States and Territories of the

United States by the people thereof as a day of thanksgiving and praise to

Almighty God , with due remembrance that " in His temple doth every man

A PROCLAMATION.

Preamble. Decree of blockade of Matamoras and other Mexican ports declared null and void.

Where as a war is existing in the Republic of Mexico, aggravated by foreign military intervention;
And whereas the United States, in accordance with their settled habits and policy, are a neutral power in regard to the war which thus afflicts the Republic of Mexico;
And whereas it has become known that one of the belligerents in the said war, namely, the Prince Maximilian, who asserts himself to be Emperor in Mexico, has issued a decree in regard to the port of Matamoras, and other Mexican ports which are in the occupation and possession of another of the said belligerents, namely, the United States of Mexico, which decree is in the following words: --
" The port of Matamoras, and all those of the northern frontier which have withdrawn from their obedience to the government, are closed to foreign and coasting traffic during such time as the empire of the law shall not be therein reinstated.
" Art . 2d. Merchandise proceeding from the said ports, on arriving at any other where the excise of the Empire is collected, shall pay the duties on importation, introduction, and consumption ; and on satisfactory proof of contravention shall be irremissibly confiscated. Our Minister of the Treasury is charged with the punctual execution of this decree.
" Given at Mexico, the 9th of July, 1866." And whereas the decree thus recited, by declaring a belligerent blockade unsupported by competent military or naval force, is in violation of the neutral rights of the United States, as defined by the law of nations, as well as of the treaties existing between the United States of America and the aforesaid United States of Mexico : Now, therefore, I, Andre w Joh ns on , President of the United States, do hereby proclaim and declare, that the aforesaid decree is held, and will be held, by the United States to be absolutely null and void, as against the government and citizens of the United States ; and that any attempt which shall be made to enforce the same against the government or the citizens of the United States will be disallowed. In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.

gency, Congress, banishing all feelings of mere passion or resentment, will re-

collect only its duty to the whole country; that this war is not waged upon our

part in any spirit of oppression nor for any purpose of conquest or subjugation,

nor purpose of overthrowing or interfering with the rights or established insti-

And whereas, the Senate of the United States, on the twenty-fifth day of

Union with all the dignity, equality, and rights of the several States unimpaired ;

thirteenth of June, eighteen hundred and sixty-five, declared that the insurrection in the State of Tennessee had been suppressed, and that the authority of the United States therein was undisputed, and that such United States officers as had been duly commissioned were in the undisturbed exercise of their official functions;
And whereas, the President of the United States, by further proclamation issued on the second day of April, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-six, did promulgate and declare, that there no longer existed any armed resistance of misguided citizens, or others, to the authority of the United States in any, or in all the States before mentioned, excepting only the State of Texas, and did further promulgate and declare that the laws could be sustained and enforced in the several States before mentioned, except Texas, by the proper civil authorities, State, or Federal, and that the people of the said States, except Texas, are well and loyally disposed, and have conformed or will conform in their legislation to the condition of affairs growing out of the amendment to the Constitution of the United States, prohibiting slavery within the limits and jurisdiction of the United States;
And did further declare in the same proclamation that it is the manifest determination of the American people that no State, of its own will, has a right or power to go out of or separate itself from, or be separated from the American Union ; and that, therefore, each State ought to remain and constitute an integral part of the United States;
And did further declare in the same last-mentioned proclamation, that the several aforementioned States, excepting Texas, had, in the manner aforesaid, given satisfactory evidence that they acquiesce in this sovereign and important resolution of national unity;
And whereas, the President of the United States in the same proclamation did further declare that it is believed to be a fundamental principle of government that the people who have revolted, and who have been overcome and subdued, must either be dealt with so as to induce them voluntarily to become friends, or else they must be held by absolute military power, or devastated, so as to prevent them from ever again doing harm as enemies, which last-named policy is abhorrent to humanity and to freedom;
And whereas, the President did in the same proclamation further declare, that the Constitution of the United States provides for constituent communities only as States, and not as Territories, dependencies, provinces or protectorates;
And further, that such constituent States must necessarily be, and by the Constitution and laws of the United States are made equals, and placed upon a like footing as to political rights, immunities, dignity and power with the several States with which they are united;
And did further declare, that the observance of political equality as a principle of right and justice is w ell calculated to encourage the people of the beforenamed States, except Texas, to be, and to become more and more constant and persevering in their renewed allegiance;
And whereas, the President did. further declare that standing armies, military occupation, martial law, military tribunals, and the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus are, in time of peace, dangerous to public liberty, incompatible with the individual rights of the citizen, contrary to the genius and spirit of our free institutions, and exhaustive of the national resources, and ought not, therefore, to be sanctioned, or allowed, except in cases of actual necessity, for repelling invasion or suppressing insurrection or rebellion;
And the President did further in the same proclamation declare that the policy of the government of the United States from the beginning of the insurrection to its overthrow and final suppression, had been conducted in conformity with the principles in the last-named proclamation recited ;
And whereas, the President in the said proclamation of the thirteenth of June, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-five, upon the grounds therein stated and hereinbefore recited, did then and thereby proclaim and declare that the insurrection which heretofore existed in the several States before named, except in Texas, was at an end, and was henceforth to be so regarded ;
And whereas, subsequently to the said second day of April, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-six, the insurrection in the State of Texas has been completely and everywhere suppressed and ended, and the authority of the United States has been successfully and completely established in the said State of Texas, and now remains therein unresisted and undisputed, and such of the proper United States officers as have been duly commissioned within the limits of the said State, arc now in the undisturbed exercise of their official functions;

APPENDIX.

And whereas, the laws can now be sustained and enforced in the said State of Texas, by the proper civil authority, State or Federal, and the people of the said State of Texas, like the people of the other States before named, are well and loyally disposed, and have conformed or will conform in their legislation to the condition of affairs growing out of the amendment of the Constitution of the United States, prohibiting slavery within the limits and jurisdiction of the United States;
And whereas all the reasons and conclusions set forth in regard to the several States therein specially named now apply equally and in all respects to the State of Texas, as well as to the other States which has been involved in insurrection ;
And whereas, adequate provision has been made by military orders, to enforce the execution of the acts of Congress, aid the civil authorities, and secure obedience to the Constitution and laws of the United States within the State of Texas, if a resort to military force for such purpose should at any time become necessary;
Now, therefore, I, Andrew Johns on , President of the United States, do hereby proclaim and declare that the insurrection which heretofore existed in the State of Texas is at an end, and is to be henceforth so regarded in that State, as in the other States before named, in which the said insurrection was proclaimed to be at an end, by the aforesaid proclamation of the second day of April, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-six.
And I do further proclaim that the said insurrection is at an end, and that peace, order, tranquillity and civil authority now exist in and throughout the whole of the United States of America.
In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.

NATIONAL THANKSGIVING.

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES [OF AMERICA:] Oct. 8, 1866.

A PROCLAMATION.

Almig ht y God , our heavenly Father, has been pleased to vouchsafe to us, as a people, another year of that national life which is an indispensable condition of peace, security, and progress. That year has, moreover, been crowned with many peculiar blessings.
The civil war that so recently closed among us has not been anywhere reopened. Foreign intervention has ceased to excite alarm or apprehension. Intrusive pestilence has been benignly mitigated. Domestic tranquillity has improved, sentiments of conciliation have largely prevailed, and affections of loyalty and patriotism have been widely renewed. Our fields have yielded quite abundantly. Our mining industry has been richly rewarded, and we have been allowed to extend our railroad system far into the interior recesses of the country, while our commerce has resumed its customary activity in foreign seas.

These great national blessings demand a national acknowledgment.

Now, therefore, I, And rew Joh ns on , President of the United States, do

hereby recommend that Thursday, the twenty-ninth day of November next, be

set apart and be observed everywhere in the several States and Territories of the

United States by the people thereof as a day of thanksgiving and praise to

Arti cle XI. Whereas the land occupied by the Choctaw and Chickasaw nations, and described in the treaty between the United States and said nations, of June twenty-second, eighteen hundred and fifty-five, is now held by the members of said nations in common, under the provisions of the said treaty; and whereas it is believed that the holding of said land in severalty will promote the general civilization of said nations, and tend to advance their permanent welfare and the best interests of their individual members, it is hereby agreed that, should the Choctaw and Chickasaw people, through their respective legislative councils, agree to the survey and dividing their land on the system of the United States, the land aforesaid east of the ninety-eighth degree of west longitude shall be, in view of the arrangements hereinafter mentioned, surveyed and laid off in ranges, townships, sections, and parts of sections ; and that for the purpose of facilitating such surveys and for the settlement and distribution of said land as hereinafter provided, there shall be established at Boggy Depot, in the Choctaw territory, a land office; and that, in making the said surveys and conducting the business of the said office, including the appointment of all necessary agents and surveyors, the same system shall be pursued which has heretofore governed in respect to the public lands of the United States, it being understood that the said surveys shall be made at the cost of the United States and by their agents and surveyors, as in the case of their own public lands, and that the officers and employes shall receive the same compensation as is paid to officers and employes in the land offices of the United States in Kansas.
Art ic le XII. The maps of said, surveys shall exhibit, as far as practicable, the outlines of the actual occupancy of members of the said nations, respectively; and when they are completed, shall be returned to the said land office at Boggy Depot for inspection by all parties interested, when notice for ninety days shall be given of such return, in such manner as the legislative authorities of the said nations, respectively, shall prescribe, or, in the event of said authorities failing to give such notice in a reasonable time, in such manner as the register of said land office shall prescribe, calling upon all parties interested to examine said maps to the end that errors, if any, in the location of such occupancies, may be corrected.
Art ic le XIII. The notice required in the above article shall be given, not only in the Choctaw and Chickasaw nations, but by publication in newspapers printed in the States of Mississippi and Tennessee, Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas, and Alabama, to the end that such Choctaws and Chickasaws as yet remain outside of the Choctaw and Chickasaw nations, may be informed and have opportunity to exercise the rights hereby given to resident Choctaws and Chickasaws : Provided, That before any such absent Choctaw or Chickasaw shall be permitted to select for him or herself, or others, as hereinafter provided, he or she shall satisfy the register of the land office of his or her intention, or the intention of the party for whom the selection is to be made, to become bona fide resident in the said nation within five years from the time of selection; and should the said absentee fail to remove into said nation, and occupy and commence an improvement on the land selected within the time aforesaid, the said selection shall be can-

Art ic le XVIII. In making a selection for children the parent shall have a prior right to select land adjacent to his own improvements or selection, provided such selection shall be made within thirty days from the time at which selections under this treaty commence.
Art ic le XIX. The manner of selecting as aforesaid shall be by an entry with the register of the land office, and all selections shall be made to conform to the legal subdivisions of the said lands as shown by the surveys aforesaid on the maps aforesaid; it being understood that nothing herein contained is to be construed to confine a party selecting to one section, but he may take contiguous parts of sections by legal subdivisions in different sections, not exceeding together a quarter-section.
Art ic le XX. Prior to any entries being made under the foregoing provisions, proof of improvements, or actual cultivation, as well as the number of persons for whom a parent or guardian, or probate judge of the county proposes to select and of their right to select, and of his or her authority to select for them, shall be made to the register and receiver of the land office, under regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior.
Art ic le XXL In every township the sections of land numbered sixteen and thirty-six shall be reserved for the support of schools in said township: Provided, That if the same has been already occupied by a party or parties having the right to select it, or it shall be so sterile as to be unavailable, the legislative authorities of the particular nations shall have the right to select such other unoccupied sections as they may think proper.

Art ic le XXIII. The register of the land office shall inscribe in a suitable book or books, in alphabetical order, the name of every individual for whom a selection shall be made, his or her age, and a description of the land selected.
Arti cle XXIV. Whereas it may be difficult to give to each occupant of an improvement a quarter-section of land, or even a smaller subdivision, which shall include such improvement, in consequence of such improvements lying in towns, villages, or hamlets, the legislative authorities of the respective nations shall have power, where, in their discretion, they think it expedient, to lay off into town lots any section or part of a section so occupied, to which lots the actual occupants, being citizens of the respective nations, shall have pre-emptive right, and, upon paying into the treasury of the particular nation the price of the land as fixed by the respective legislatures, exclusive of the value of said improvement, shall receive a conveyance thereof. Such occupant shall not be prejudiced thereby in his right to his selection elsewhere. The town lots which may be unoccupied shall be disposed of for the benefit of the particular nation, as the legislative authorities may direct from time to time. When the number of occupants of the same quarter-section shall
not be such as to authorize the legislative authorities to lay out the same, or any part thereof, into town lots, they may make such regulations for the disposition thereof as they may deem proper, either by subdivision of the same, so as to accommodate the actual occupants, or by giving the right of prior choice to the first occupant in point of time, upon paying the others for their improvements, to be valued in such way as the legislative authorities shall prescribe, or otherwise. All occupants retaining their lots under this section, and desiring, in addition, to make a selection, must pay for the lots so retained, as in the case of town lots. And any

Choctaw or Chickasaw who may desire to select a sectional division other than that on which his homestead is, without abandoning the latter, shall have the right to purchase the homestead sectional division at such price as the respective legislatures may prescribe.
Art ic le XXV. During ninety days from the expiration of the ninety days' notice aforesaid, the Choctaws and Chickasaws shall have the exclusive right to make selections, as aforesaid, and at the end of that time the several parties shall be entitled to patents for their respective selections, to be issued by the President of the United States, and countersigned by the chief executive officer of the nation in which the land lies, and recorded in the records of the executive office of the particular nation; and copies of the said patents, under seal, shall be evidence in any court of law or equity.
Art ic le XXVI. The right here given to Choctaws and Chickasaws, respectively, shall extend to all persons who have become citizens by adoption or intermarriage of either of said nations, or who may hereafter
become such. Arti cle XXVII. In the event of disputes arising in regard to the
rights of parties to select particular quarter-sections or other divisions of said land, or in regard to the adjustment of boundaries, so as to make them conform to legal divisions and subdivisions such disputes shall be settled by the register of the land office and the chief executive officer of the nation in which the land lies, in a summary way, after hearing the parties ; and if said register and chief officer cannot agree, the two to call in a third party, who shall constitute a third referee, the decision of any two of
whom shall be final, without appeal. Art ic le XXVIII. Nothing contained in any law of either of the
said nations shall prevent parties entitled to make selections contiguous to each other; and the Choctaw and Chickasaw nations hereby agree to repeal all laws inconsistent with this provision.
Art ic le XXIX. Selections made under this treaty shall, to the extent of one quarter-section, including the homestead or dwelling, be inalienable for the period of twenty-one years from the date of such selection, and upon the death of the party in possession shall descend according to the laws of the nation where the land lies; and in the event of his or her death without heirs, the said quarter-section shall escheat to and become the property of the nation.

Art ic le XXXI. And whereas some time must necessarily elapse before the surveys, maps, and selections herein provided for can be completed so as to permit the said Kansas Indians to make their selections in their order, during which time the United States may desire to remove the said Indians from their present abiding places, it is hereby agreed that the said Indians may at once come into the Choctaw and Chickasaw nations, settling themselves temporarily as citizens of the said nations, respectively, upon such land as suits them and is not already occupied.
Arti cle XXXII. At the expiration of two years, or sooner, if the President of the United States shall so direct, from the completion of the surveys and maps aforesaid, the officers of the land offices aforesaid shall deliver to the executive departments of the Choctaw and Chickasaw nations, respectively,' all such documents as may be necessary to elucidate the land title as settled according to this treaty, and forward copies thereof, with the field-notes, records, and other papers pertaining to said titles, to the commissioner of the general land office; and thereafter grants of land and patents therefor shall be issued in such manner as the legislative authorities of said nations may provide for all the unselected portions of the Choctaw and Chickasaw districts as defined by the treaty of June twenty-second, eighteen hundred and fifty-five.
Art ic le XXXIII. All lands selected as herein provided shall thereafter be held in severalty by the respective parties, and the unselected land shall be the common property of the Choctaw and Chickasaw nations, in their corporate capacities, subject to the joint control of their
legislative authorities. Art ic le XXXIV. Should any Choctaw or Chickasaw be prevented
from selecting for him or herself during the the ninety days aforesaid, the failure to do so shall not authorize another to select the quarter-section containing his improvement, but he may at any time make his selection thereof, subject to having his boundaries made to conform to legal divisions as aforesaid.
Art ic le XXXV. Should the selections aforesaid not be made before the transfer of the land records to the executive authorities of said nations, respectively, they shall be made according to such regulations as the legislative authorities of the two nations, respectively, may prescribe, to the end that full justice and equity may be done to the citizens of the respective territories.
Art ic le XXXVI. Should any land that has been selected under the provisions of this treaty be abandoned and left uncultivated for the space of seven years by the party selecting the same, or his heirs, except in the case of infants under the age of twenty-one years, or married women, or persons non compos mentis, the legislative authorities of the nation where such land lies may either rent the same for the benefit of those interested, or dispose of the same otherwise for their benefit, and may pass all laws necessary to give effect to this provision.
Art ic le XXXVII. In consideration of the right of selection hereinbefore accorded to certain Indians other than the Choctaws and Chickasaws, the United States agree to pay to the Choctaw and Chickasaw nations, out of the funds of Indians removing into said nations respectively, under the provisions of this treaty, such sum as may be fixed by the

CONVENTION WITH VENEZUELA. Apri l 25, 1866.

713

Convention between the United States of America and the Republic of Venezuela : Concluded at Caracas, April 25, I860 ; Proclaimed by the President of the United States, May 29, 1867.
BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: April 25,1866.

A PROCLAMATION.

Whe re as a convention between the United States of America and the Republic of Venezuela was concluded and signed by their respective plenipotentiaries at the city of Caracas, on the twenty-fifth day of April, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixtysix, which convention, being in the English and Spanish languages, is,
word for word, as follows : --

Preamble.

The conclusion of a convention similar to those entered into' with other republics, and by which the pending American claims upon Venezuela might be referred for decision to a mixed commission and an umpire, having been proposed to the Venezuelan government on behalf of the United States of America, as a means of examining and justly terminating such claims ; and it having been thought that the adoption of the contemplated course will secure at least some of the advantages attending arbitration, so strongly recommended in article, the 112th of the federal constitution of Venezuela, while it will preserve unimpaired, as reciprocally desired, the good understanding of both nations, the citizen first vice-president in
charge of the presidency has accepted the above proposal, and authorized the minister for foreign relations to negotiate and sign the proper convention. Thereupon said minister and Mr. E. D. Culver, minister resident of the United States of America, also duly empowered for that purpose, have agreed upon the following : --

Habiendose propuesto al Gobierno de parte de los Estados Unidos de America, como medio de con siderar y resolver en justicia las reclamaciones pendientes de ciudadanos de
ellos contra los Estados Unidos de Venezuela, la celebracion de un convenio analogo a los ajustados con otras republicas, y por el cual se pone la decision de tales asuntos en manos de una Comision Mixta y de un tercero en discordia, y habiendose juzgado que ase se logran, siquiera en parte, las ventajas del arbitraimento, tan recomendado en el articulo 112 de la Constitucion Federal de Venezuela, al paso que se mantendra siempre desembarazada la buena correspondencia de ambas naciones, segun mutuamente se desea; el Ciudadano Primer Designado en ejercicio de la Presidencia ha suscrito a la propuesta, y expedido al Ministro de Relaciones Exteriores
las ordenes consiguientes para negociar y firmar la con ven ci on respectiva. En esta virtud, dicho Ministro y el Senor E. D. Culver, Ministro Residente de los Estados Unidos de America, provisto de autorizacion bastante, han convenido en los articulos siguientes.
