shall express her length and breadth, together with her depth and the height under the third or spar deck, which shall be ascertained in the following manner: The tonnage-deck, in vessels having three or more decks to the hull, shall be the second deck from below; in all other cases the upper deck of the hull is to be the tonnage-deck. The length from the forepart of the outer planking, on the side of the stem, to the afterpart of the main sternpost of screw steamers, and to the afterpart of the rudderpost of all other vessels measured on the top of the tonnage-deck, shall be
accounted the vessel's length. The breadth of the broadest part on the outside of the vessel shall be accounted the vessel's breadth of beam. A measure from the under side of tonnage-deck plank, amidships, to the ceiling of the hold (average thickness) shall be accounted the depth of hold. If the vessel has a third deck, then the height from the top of the tonnage-deck plank to the under side of the .upper-deck plank shall be accounted as the height under the spar-deck. All measurement to be taken in feet and fractions of feet; and all fractions of feet shall be expressed in decimals.
Sec . 3. And be it further enacted, That the register tonnage of a ves-
sel shall be her entire internal cubical capacity in tons of one hundred cubic feet each, to be ascertained as follows: Measure the length of the vessel in a straight line along the upper side of the tonnage-deck, from the inside of the inner plank (average thickness,) at the side of the stem to the inside of the plank on the stern timbers, (average thickness,) deducting from this length what is due to the rake of the bow in the thickness of the deck, and what is due to the rake of the stern-timber in the
thickness of the deck, and also what is due to the rake of the stern-timber in one third of the round of the beam ; divide the length so taken into the number of equal parts required by the following table, according to the class in such table to which the vessel belongs :--

Table of classes of vessels.
Class first, second,
third,
fourth,
fifth, sixth.
Transverse area of vessel, how ascertained.

TABLE OF CLASSES.
Class 1.--Vessels of which the tonnage length according to the above measurement is fifty feet or under, into six equal parts.
Class 2.--Vessels of which the tonnage length according to the above measurement is above fifty feet, and not exceeding one hundred feet long, into eight equal parts.
Class 3.--Vessels of which the tonnage length according to the above measurement is above one hundred feet long, and not exceeding one hundred and fifty feet long, into ten equal parts.
Class 4.--Vessels of which the tonnage length according to the above measurement is above one hundred and fifty feet, and not exceeding two hundred feet long, into twelve equal parts.
Class 5.--Vessels of which the tonnage length according to the above measurement is above two hundred feet, and not exceeding two hundred and fifty feet long, into fourteen equal parts.
Class 6.--Vessels of which the tonnage length according to the above measurement is above two hundred and fifty feet long, into sixteen equal parts.
Then, the hold being sufficiently cleared to admit of the required depths and breadths being properly taken, find the transverse area of such vessel at each point of division of the length as follows :--
Measure the depth at each point of division from a point at a distance of one third of the round of the beam below such deck, or, in case of a break, below a line stretched in continuation thereof, to the upper side of the floor-timber, at the inside of the limber-strake, after deducting the average thickness of the ceiling, which is between the bilge-planks and limber-strake; then, if the depth at the midship division of the length do not exceed sixteen feet, divide each depth into four equal parts ; then measure the inside horizontal breadth, at each of the three points of divis-

ion, and also at the upper and lower points of the depth, extending each measurement to the average thickness of that part of the ceiling which is between the points of measurement; number these breadths from above, (numbering the upper breadth one, and so on down to the lowest breadth ;) multiply the second and fourth by four, and the third by two ; add these products together, and to the sum add the first breadth and the last, or fifth; multiply the quantity thus obtained by one third of the common interval between the breadths, and the product shall be deemed the transverse area; but if the midship depth exceed sixteen feet, divide each depth into six equal parts, instead of four, and measure, as before directed, the horizontal breadths at the five points of division, and also at the upper and lower points of the depth ; number them from above as before ; multiply the second, fourth, and sixth, by four, and the third and fifth by two; add these products together, and to the sum add the first breadth and the last, or seventh ; multiply the quantities thus obtained by one third of the common interval between the breadths, and the product shall be deemed the transverse area.
Having thus ascertained the transverse area at each point of division of the length of the vessel, as required above, proceed to ascertain the register tonnage of the vessel in the following manner: --
Number the areas successively one, two, three, &c., number one being at the extreme limit of the length at the bow, and the last number at the extreme limit of the length at the stern; then whether the length be divided according to table, into six or sixteen parts, as in classes one and six, or any intermediate number, as in classes two, three, four, and five, multiply the second, and every even-numbered area, by four, and the third and every odd-numbered area (except the first and last) by two; add these products together, and to the sum add the first and last, if they yield anything ; multiply the quantities thus obtained by one third of the common interval between the areas, and the product will be the cubical contents of the space under the tonnage-deck ; divide this product by one hundred, and the quotient, being the tonnage under the tonnage-deck, shall be deemed to be the register tonnage of the vessel, subject to the additions hereinafter mentioned.
If there be a break, a poop, or any other permanent closed-in space on the upper decks, on the spar-deck, available for cargo, or stores, or for the berthing or accommodation of passengers or crew, the tonnage of such space shall be ascertained as follows : --
Measure the internal mean length of such space in feet, and divide it into an even number of equal parts of which the distance asunder shall be most nearly equal to those into which the length of the tonnage-deck has been divided ; measure at the middle of its height the inside breadths, namely, one at each end and at each of the points of division, numbering them successively one, two, three, &c.; then to the sum of the end breadths add four times the sum of the even-numbered breadths and twice the sum of the odd-numbered breadths, except the first and last, and multiply the whole sum by one third of the common interval between the breadths ; the product will give the mean horizontal area of such space ; then measure the mean height between the planks of the decks, and multi-
ply by the mean horizontal area; divide the product by one hundred, and the quotient shall be deemed to be the tonnage of such space, and shall be added to the tonnage under the tonnage-decks, ascertained as aforesaid.
If a vessel has a third deck, or spar-deck, the tonnage of the space between it and the tonnage-deck shall be ascertained as follows : --
Measure in feet the inside length of the space, at the middle of its height, from the plank at the side of the stem, to the plank on the timbers at the stern, and divide the length into the same number of equal parts
into which the length of the tonnage-deck is divided; measure (also at

And if the vessel has more than three decks, the tonnage of each space between decks, above the tonnage-deck, shall be severally ascertained in the manner above described, and shall be added to the tonnage of the vessel, ascertained as aforesaid.
In ascertaining the tonnage of open vessels the upper edge of the upper strake is to form the boundary line of measurement, and the depth shall be taken from an athwartship line, extending from upper edge of said strake at each division of the length.

And be it further enacted, That every association may take, receive, reserve, and charge on any loan or discount made, or upon any note, bill of exchange, or other evidences of debt, interest at the rate allowed by the laws of the state or territory where the bank is located, and no more, except that where by the laws of any state a different rate is limited for banks of issue organized under state laws, the rate so limited shall be allowed for associations organized in any such state under this act. And when no rate is fixed by the laws of the state or territory, the bank may take, receive, reserve, or charge a rate not exceeding seven per centum, and such interest may be taken in advance, reckoning the days for which the note, bill, or other evidence of debt has to run. And the knowingly taking, receiving, reserving, or charging a rate of interest greater than aforesaid shall be held and adjudged a forfeiture of the entire interest which the note, bill, or other evidence of debt carries with it, or which has been agreed to be paid thereon. And in case a greater rate of interest has been paid, the person or persons paying the same, or their legal representatives, may recover back, in any action of debt, twice the amount of the interest thus paid from the association taking or receiving the same: Provided, That such action is commenced within two years from the time the usurious transaction occurred. But the purchase, discount, or sale of a bona fide bill of exchange, payable at another place than the place of such purchase, discount, or sale, at not more than the current rate of exchange for sight drafts in addition to the interest, shall not be considered as taking or receiving a greater rate of interest.

And whenever the lawful money of any association in any of the cities hereinafter named shall be below the amount of twenty-five per centum of its circulation and deposits, and whenever the lawful money of any other association shall be below fifteen per centum of its circulation and deposits, such associations shall not increase its liabilities by making any new loans or discounts otherwise than by discounting or purchasing bills

Sec . 42. And be it further enacted, That any association may go into liquidation and be closed by the vote of its shareholders owning two thirds of its stock. And whenever such vote shall be taken it shall be the duty of the board of directors to cause notice of this fact to be certified, under the seal of the association, by its president or cashier, to the
comptroller of the currency, and publication thereof to be made for a period of two months in a newspaper published in the city of New York, and also in a newspaper published in a city or town in which the association is located, and if no newspaper be there published, then in the newspaper published nearest thereto, that said association is closing up its

And at any time after the expiration of one year from the time of the publication of such notice as aforesaid, the said association may pay over to the treasurer of the United States the amount of itsoutstanding notes in the lawful money of the United States, and take up the bonds which said association has on deposit with the treasurer for the security of its circulating notes; which bonds shall be assigned to the bank in the manner specified in the nineteenth section of this act, and from that time the outstanding notes of said association shall be redeemed at the treasury of the United States, and the said association and the shareholders thereof shall be discharged from all liabilities therefor.
Sec . 43.

said conversion, and the directors aforesaid may be the directors of the

association until others are elected or appointed in accordance with the

provisions of this act; and any state bank which is a stockholder in any

other bank, by authority of state laws, may continue to hold its stock,

although either bank, or both, may be organized under and have accepted

the provisions of this act. When the comptroller shall give to such

association a certificate, under his hand and official seal, that the pro-

visions of this act have been complied with, and that it is authorized to

commence the business of banking under it, the association shall have

the same powers and privileges, and shall be subject to the same duties,

responsibilities, and rules, in all respects as are prescribed in this act for

other associations organized under it, and shall be held and regarded as

an association under this act: Provided, however, That no such associa-

tion shall have a less capital than the amount prescribed for banking

Sec . 47. And be it further enacted, That on receiving notice that any such association has failed to redeem any of its circulating notes, as specified in the next preceding section, the comptroller of the currency, with the concurrence of the Secretary of the Treasury, may appoint a special agent (of whose appointment immediate notice shall be given to such association) who shall immediately proceed to ascertain whether such association has refused to pay its circulating notes in the lawful money of the United States, when demanded as aforesaid, and report to the comptroller the fact so ascertained ; and if, from such protest or the report so made, the comptroller shall be satisfied that such association has refused to pay its circulating notes as aforesaid and is in default, he shall, within thirty days after he shall have received notice of such failure, declare the United States bonds and securities pledged by such association forfeited to the United States, and the same shall thereupon be forfeited accordingly. And thereupon the comptroller shall immediately give notice in such manner as the Secretary of the Treasury shall, by general rules or otherwise, direct, to the holders of the circulating notes of such association to present them for payment at the treasury of the United States, and the same shall be paid as presented in lawful money of the United States; whereupon said comptroller may, in his discretion, cancel an amount of bonds pledged by such association equal at current market rates, not exceeding par, to the notes paid. And it shall be lawful for the Secretary of the Treasury, from time to time, to make such regulations respecting the disposition to be made of such circulating notes after presentation thereof for payment as aforesaid, and respecting the perpetuation of the evidence of the payment thereof as may seem to him proper; but all such notes, on being paid, shall be cancelled. And for any deficiency in the proceeds of the bonds pledged by such association, when disposed of as hereinafter specified, to reimburse to the United States the amount so expended in paying the circulating notes of such association, the United States shall have a first and paramount lien upon all the assets of such association; and such deficiency shall be made good out of such assets in preference to any and all other claims whatsoever, except the necessary costs and expenses of administering the same.
Sec . 48. And be it further enacted, That whenever the comptroller shall become satisfied, as in the last preceding section specified, that any
association has refused to pay its circulating notes as therein mentioned, he may, instead of cancelling the United States bonds pledged by such association, as provided in the next preceding section, cause so much of them as may be necessary to redeem the outstanding circulating notes of such association to be sold at public auction in the city of New York,
after giving thirty days' notice of such sale to such association. Sec . 49. And be it further enacted, That the comptroller of the cur-
rency may, if he shall be of opinion that the interests of the United States will be best promoted thereby, sell at private sale any of the bonds pledged by such association, and receive therefor either money or the circulating notes of such failing association: Provided, That no such bonds shall be sold by private sale for less than par, nor less than the market value thereof at the time of sale : And provided, further, That no sales of any such bonds, either public or private, shall be complete until
the transfer thereof shall have been made with the formalities prescribed
in this act. Sec . 50. And be it further enacted, That on becoming satisfied, as
specified in this act, that any association has refused to pay its circulating

receiver shall pay over all money so made to the treasurer of the United

States, subject to the order of the comptroller of the currency, and also

make report to the comptroller of the currency of all his acts and pro-

ceedings. The comptroller shall thereupon cause notice to be given, by

advertisement in such newspapers as he may direct, for three consecutive

months, calling on all persons who may have claims against such associa-

tion to present the same, and to make legal proof thereof. And from

time to time the comptroller, after full provision shall have been first

made for refunding to the United States any such deficiency in redeem-

ing the notes of such association as is mentioned in this act, shall make a

ratable dividend of the money so paid over to him by such receiver on all

such claims as may have been proved to his satisfaction or adjudicated in

The court may allow such compensation as it shall deem just under the circumstances of each case to special counsel for captors, not being the district attorney or any of his assistants, whether appointed by a department of the government or by the captors, for services actually rendered in the cause, to be paid as costs, in whole or in part either from the entire fund or from the portion awarded to the captors; but no such allowance shall be made except for services rendered on matters as to which the party the counsel represents has an adverse interest to the United States, or an interest otherwise proper in the opinion of the court to be represented by special counsel, or for services rendered in a contestation between parties claiming to participate in the distribution of the proceeds.

Sec . 26. And be it further enacted, That no prize property shall be delivered to the claimants on stipulation, deposit, or other security, except where there has been a decree of restitution and the captors have appealed therefrom, or where the court, after a full hearing on the preparatory proofs, has refused to condemn the property on those proofs, and has given the captors leave to take further proofs, or where the claimant of any property shall satisfy the court that the same has a peculiar and intrinsic value to him, independent of its market value. In any of these cases, the court may deliver the property on stipulation or deposit of its value, if it shall be satisfied that the rights and interests of the United States and captors, or of other claimants, will not be prejudiced thereby, a satisfactory appraisement being first made, with an opportunity given to the district

In all cases of prize property heretofore taken for, or appropriated, to the use of the government, or that shall hereafter be so taken or appropriated, the department for whose use it was or shall be taken or appropriated, shall deposit the value thereof with the assistant treasurer of the United States nearest to the place of the session of the court, subject to the order of the court in the cause.

Sec . 29. And be it further enacted, That when any vessel or other property shall have been captured by any force hostile to the United States, and shall be recaptured, and it shall appear to the court that the same had not been condemned as prize before its recapture, by any competent authority, the court shall award a meet and competent sum as salvage, according to the circumstances of each case; and if the captured property belonged to the United States, it shall be restored to the United States, and there shall be paid from the treasury of the United States the salvage, costs, and expenses ordered by the court; and if the recaptured property belonged to persons residing within or under the protection of the United States, the court shall adjudge the property to be restored to its owners upon their claim, on the payment of such sum as the court may award as salvage, costs, and expenses ; and if the recaptured property belonged to any person permanently resident within the territory and under the protection of any foreign prince, government, or state in amity with the United States, and by the law or usage of such prince, government, or state, the property of a citizen of the United States would be restored under like circumstances of recapture, it shall be adjudged to be restored to such owner upon his claim, upon such terms as by the law or usage of such prince, government, or state would be required of a citizen

No. 13.

Feb. 18,1864. BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:

A PROCLAMATION.

Preamble. Vol. xii. p. 1258.
Blockade of Brownsville to cease -- so far that, &c. 1861, ch. 3, § 5. Vol. xii. p. 257.
Certain shipments, &c., not allowed.
List of prohibited articles.
Licenses to vessels from foreign ports.
Violation of conditions to work forfeiture.

Whe re as , by my proclamation of the nineteenth of April, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-one, the ports of the States of South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas were, for reasons therein set forth, placed under blockade; and whereas, the port of Brownsville, in the
district of Brazos Santiago, in the State of Texas, has since been blockaded, but as the blockade of said port may now be safely relaxed with advantage to the interests of commerce:
Now, therefore, be it known that I, Abr ah am Lin co ln , President of the United States, pursuant to the authority in me vested by the fifth section of the act of congress, approved on the 13th of July, 1861, entitled "An act further
to provide for the collection of duties on imports, and for other purposes," do
hereby declare that the blockade of the said port of Brownsville shall so far cease and determine from and after this date, that commercial intercourse with said port, except as to persons, things, and information hereinafter specified, may, from this date, be carried on, subject to the laws of the United States, to the regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, and, until the rebellion shall have been suppressed, to such orders as may be promulgated by the general commanding the department, or by an officer duly authorized by him and
commanding at said port. This proclamation does not authorize or allow the shipment or conveyance of persons in, or intending to enter, the service of the insurgents, or of things or information intended for their use, or for their aid or com-
fort, nor, except upon the permission of the Secretary of War, or of some officer duly authorized by him, of the following prohibited articles, namely : cannon, mortars, firearms, pistols, bombs, grenades, powder, saltpetre, sulphur, balls, bullets,
pikes, swords, boarding-caps, (always excepting the quantity of the said articles which may be necessary for the defence of the ship and those who compose the crew,) saddles, bridles, cartridge-bag material, percussion and other caps, cloth-
ing adapted for uniforms, sailcloth of all kinds, hemp and cordage, intoxicating drinks, other than beer and light native wines.
To vessels clearing from foreign ports and destined to the port of Brownsville, opened by this proclamation, licenses will be granted by consuls of the United States upon satisfactory evidence that the vessel so licensed will convey no persons, property, or information excepted or prohibited above, either to or from the said port; which licenses shall be exhibited to the collector of said port immediately on arrival, and, if required, to any officer in charge of the blockade; and on leaving said port every vessel will be required to have a clearance from the collector of the customs, according to law, showing no violation of the con-
ditions of the license. Any violations of said conditions will involve the forfeiture and condemnation of the vessel and cargo, and the exclusion of all parties concerned from any further privilege of entering the United States during the war for any purpose whatever.
In all respects, except as herein specified, the existing blockade remains in full force and effect as hitherto established, and maintained, nor is it relaxed by this proclamation except in regard to the port to which relaxation is or has been expressly applied.
In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.

Ante, p. 734.

Whe re as , by a proclamation which was issued on the 15th day of April, 1861, the President of the United States announced and declared that the laws of the United States had been for some time past, and then were, opposed, and the execution thereof obstructed, in certain states therein mentioned, by combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings, or by the powers vested in the marshals by law ;
And whereas, immediately after the issuing of the said proclamation, the land and naval forces of the United States were put into activity to suppress the said insurrection and rebellion;
And whereas the congress of the United States, by an act approved on the 3d day of March, 1863, did enact that during the said rebellion the President of the United States, whenever in his judgment the public safety may require it, is authorized to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus in any case throughout the United States, or in any part thereof;
And whereas the said insurrection and rebellion still continue, endangering
the existence of the constitution and government of the United States ; And whereas the military forces of the United States are now actively en-
gaged in suppressing the said insurrection and rebellion in various parts of the states where the said rebellion has been successful in obstructing the laws and public authorities, especially in the States of Virginia and Georgia:
And whereas, on the fifteenth day of September last, the President of the United States duly issued his proclamation, wherein he declared that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus should be suspended throughout the United States in the cases where, by the authority of the President of the United States, military, naval, and civil officers of the United States, or any of them, hold persons under their command or in their custody, either as prisoners of war, spies, or aiders or abettors of the enemy, or officers, soldiers, or seamen enrolled or drafted or mustered or enlisted in, or belonging to, the land or naval forces of the United States, or as deserters therefrom, or otherwise amenable to military law or the rules and articles of war, or the rules or regulations prescribed for the military or naval services by authority of the President of the United States, or for resisting a draft, or for any other offence against the military or naval
service; And whereas many citizens of the State of Kentucky have joined the forces
of the insurgents, and such insurgents have on several occasions entered the

A PROCLAMATION.

Whe rea s a treaty of friendship, commerce, and navigation between the United States of America and the Republic of Honduras was concluded and signed by their respective plenipotentiaries at Comayagua, on the fourth day of July, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-four, which treaty, being in the English and Spanish languages, is, word for word, as follows : --

Preamble.

Treaty offriendship, commerce, and navigation, between the United States of America and the Republic of Honduras.

Ante, p. 734.

Whe re as , by a proclamation which was issued on the 15th day of April, 1861, the President of the United States announced and declared that the laws of the United States had been for some time past, and then were, opposed, and the execution thereof obstructed, in certain states therein mentioned, by combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings, or by the powers vested in the marshals by law ;
And whereas, immediately after the issuing of the said proclamation, the land and naval forces of the United States were put into activity to suppress the said insurrection and rebellion;
And whereas the congress of the United States, by an act approved on the 3d day of March, 1863, did enact that during the said rebellion the President of the United States, whenever in his judgment the public safety may require it, is authorized to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus in any case throughout the United States, or in any part thereof;
And whereas the said insurrection and rebellion still continue, endangering
the existence of the constitution and government of the United States ; And whereas the military forces of the United States are now actively en-
gaged in suppressing the said insurrection and rebellion in various parts of the states where the said rebellion has been successful in obstructing the laws and public authorities, especially in the States of Virginia and Georgia:
And whereas, on the fifteenth day of September last, the President of the United States duly issued his proclamation, wherein he declared that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus should be suspended throughout the United States in the cases where, by the authority of the President of the United States, military, naval, and civil officers of the United States, or any of them, hold persons under their command or in their custody, either as prisoners of war, spies, or aiders or abettors of the enemy, or officers, soldiers, or seamen enrolled or drafted or mustered or enlisted in, or belonging to, the land or naval forces of the United States, or as deserters therefrom, or otherwise amenable to military law or the rules and articles of war, or the rules or regulations prescribed for the military or naval services by authority of the President of the United States, or for resisting a draft, or for any other offence against the military or naval
service; And whereas many citizens of the State of Kentucky have joined the forces
of the insurgents, and such insurgents have on several occasions entered the

said State of Kentucky in large force, and, not without aid and comfort furnished by disaffected and disloyal citizens of the United States residing therein, have not only greatly disturbed the public peace, but have overborne the civil authorities and made flagrant civil war, destroying property and life in various
parts of that state ; And whereas it has been made known to the President of the United States
by the officers commanding the national armies, that combinations have been formed in the said State of Kentucky with a purpose of inciting rebel forces to renew the said operations of civil war within the said state, and thereby to em-
barrass the United States armies now operating in the said States of Virginia and Georgia, and even to endanger their safety :
Now, therefore, I, Abra ham Linc oln , President of the United States, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the constitution and laws, do hereby declare that, in my judgment, the public safety especially requires that the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, so proclaimed in the said proclamation of the 15th of September, 1863, be made effectual and be duly enforced in and throughout the said State of Kentucky, and that martial law be for the present established therein. I do, therefore, hereby require of the military officers in the said state that the privileges of the writ of habeas corpus be effectually suspended within the said state, according to the aforesaid proclamation, and that martial law be established therein, to take effect from the date of this proclamation, the said suspension and establishment of martial law to con-
tinue until this proclamation shall be revoked or modified, but not beyond the period when the said rebellion shall have been suppressed or come to an end. And I do hereby require and command, as well all military officers as all civil officers and authorities existing or found within the said State of Kentucky, to take notice of this proclamation, and to give full effect to the same.
The martial law herein proclaimed, and the things in that respect herein ordered, will not be deemed or taken to interfere with the holding of lawful elections, or with the proceedings of the constitutional legislature of Kentucky, or with the administration of justice in the courts of law existing therein between citizens of the United States in suits or proceedings which do not affect the military operations or the constituted authorities of the government of the
United States. In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of
the United States to be affixed. Done at the city of Washington, this fifth day of July, in the year of our

Volunteers will be accepted under this call for one, two, or three years, as they may elect, and will be entitled to the bounty provided by the law for the period of service for which they enlist.
And I hereby proclaim, order, and direct, that immediately after the fifth day of September, 1864, being fifty days from the date of this call, a draft for troops

defending us with His guardian care against unfriendly designs from abroad, and vouchsafing to us in His mercy many and signal victories over the enemy, who is
of our own household. It has also pleased our Heavenly Father to favor as well
our citizens in their homes as our soldiers in their camps, and our sailors on the rivers and seas, with unusual health. He has largely augmented our free popu-
lation by emancipation and by immigration, while He has opened to us new sources of wealth, and has crowned the labor of our working men in every department of industry with abundant rewards. Moreover, He has been pleased to animate and
inspire our minds and hearts with fortitude, courage, and resolution sufficient for
the great trial of civil war into which we have been brought by our adherence
as a nation to the cause of freedom and humanity, and to afford to us reasonable hopes of an ultimate and happy deliverance from all our dangers and afflictions :
Now, therefore, I, Abr aha m Lin coln , President of the United States, do

said State of Kentucky in large force, and, not without aid and comfort furnished by disaffected and disloyal citizens of the United States residing therein, have not only greatly disturbed the public peace, but have overborne the civil authorities and made flagrant civil war, destroying property and life in various
parts of that state ; And whereas it has been made known to the President of the United States
by the officers commanding the national armies, that combinations have been formed in the said State of Kentucky with a purpose of inciting rebel forces to renew the said operations of civil war within the said state, and thereby to em-
barrass the United States armies now operating in the said States of Virginia and Georgia, and even to endanger their safety :
Now, therefore, I, Abra ham Linc oln , President of the United States, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the constitution and laws, do hereby declare that, in my judgment, the public safety especially requires that the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, so proclaimed in the said proclamation of the 15th of September, 1863, be made effectual and be duly enforced in and throughout the said State of Kentucky, and that martial law be for the present established therein. I do, therefore, hereby require of the military officers in the said state that the privileges of the writ of habeas corpus be effectually suspended within the said state, according to the aforesaid proclamation, and that martial law be established therein, to take effect from the date of this proclamation, the said suspension and establishment of martial law to con-
tinue until this proclamation shall be revoked or modified, but not beyond the period when the said rebellion shall have been suppressed or come to an end. And I do hereby require and command, as well all military officers as all civil officers and authorities existing or found within the said State of Kentucky, to take notice of this proclamation, and to give full effect to the same.
The martial law herein proclaimed, and the things in that respect herein ordered, will not be deemed or taken to interfere with the holding of lawful elections, or with the proceedings of the constitutional legislature of Kentucky, or with the administration of justice in the courts of law existing therein between citizens of the United States in suits or proceedings which do not affect the military operations or the constituted authorities of the government of the
United States. In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of
the United States to be affixed. Done at the city of Washington, this fifth day of July, in the year of our

And whereas it frequently happens that vessels sail for a port or place belonging to an enemy without knowing that the same is either besieged, blockaded, or invested, it is hereby agreed by the high contracting parties that every vessel so circumstanced may be turned away from such port or place, but she shall not be detained, nor any part of her cargo, if not contraband, be confiscated, unless, after notice of such blockade or investment, she shall again attempt to enter ; but she shall be permitted to go to any other

Et, comme il arrive frequemment que des navires partent pour un port ou une place appartenant a 1'ennemi, sans savoir que ces points sont assieges, bloques ou investis, il est ici convenu entre les hautes parties contractantes, que tout navire qui se trouvera dans ce cas pourra etre renvoye de ces ports ou places, mais ne sera pas detenu, ni aucune partie de sa cargaison, si elle n'est de contrebande, confisquee, a moins qu'apres 1'avis d'un tel blocus ou d'un tel investissement le meme navire ne tentat encore d'entrer.

Nor shall any vessel of either of the parties that may have entered into such port or place before the same was actually besieged, blockaded, or invested by the other, be restrained from quitting such place with her cargo, nor, if found therein after the reduction and surrender of such place, shall such vessel or her cargo be liable to confiscation, but they shall be restored to the owners thereof.

ARTICLE XIX.

ARTICLE XIX.

The two high contracting parties recognize as permanent and immutable the following principles, to wit: --
1. That free ships make free
goods; that is to say: that the effects or goods belonging to subjects or citizens of a power or state at war are free from capture or confiscation when found on board neutral vessels, with the exception of articles contraband of war.
2. That the property of neutrals on board of an enemy's vessel is not subject to confiscation, unless the same be contraband of war.
The like neutrality shall be extended to persons who are on board a neutral ship, with this effect, that although they may be enemies of both or either party, they are not to be taken out of that ship, unless they are officers or soldiers, and in the actual service of the enemy. The contracting parties engage to apply these principles to the commerce and navigation of all such powers and states as shall consent to adopt them as permanent and immutable.

Les deux hautes parties contractantes reconnaissent comme permanents et immuables les principes ci-apres, a savoir: --
1. Que le navire libre fait la marchandise libre, c'est a dire, que les effets et marchandises, appartenant aux sujets ou aux citoyens d'une puissance ou d'un etat en guerre, ne peuvent etre ni saisis ni confisques, si on les trouve a bord d'un navire neutre, a moins que ce ne soient des articles de contrebande de guerre.
2. Que la propriete des neutres a bord d'un navire ennemi n'est pas sujette a confiscation, a moins qu'elle ne soit contrebande de guerre.
La meme neutrality s'etend aux personnes trouvees a bord d'un navire neutre, avec cette consequence, a savoir que, quoique ces personnes puissent etre des ennemis des deux parties ou de 1'une d'elles, elles ne pourront pas etre enlevees du dit navire, a moins que ce ne soient des officiers ou des soldats au service actuel de 1'ennemi. Les parties contractantes s'engagent a appliquer ces principes au commerce et a la navigation de toutes les puissances et de tous les etats qui consentiront a les adopter comme permanents et immuables.

These passports shall be valid for any number of voyages, but shall be renewed every year.
It 4 .e vessels are laden, in addition to the passports above named, They shall be provided with certificates, in due form, made out by the officers of the place whence they sailed, so that it may be known whether they carry any contraband goods.

If it shall appear from the certificates that there are contraband goods on board any such vessel, and the commander of the same shall offer to deliver them up, that offer shall be accepted, and a receipt for the same shall be given, and the vessel shall be at liberty to pursue her voyage, unless the quantity of contraband goods be greater than can be conveniently received on board the ship-of-war or privateer, in which case, as in all other cases of just detention, the vessel shall be carried to the nearest safe and convenient port for the delivery of the same.
In case any vessel shall not be furnished with such passport or certificates as are above required for the same, such Case may be examined by a proper judge or tribunal; and if it shall appear from other documents or proofs, admissible by the usage of nations, that the vessel belongs to citizens or subjects of the neutral party, it shall not be confiscated, but shall be released with her cargo, (contraband goods excepted,) and be permitted to proceed on her voyage.

Ces passe-ports seront valables pour un nombre quelconque de voyages, mais seront renouveles tous les ans.
Si les batiments sont charges, il leur sera, en outre des passe-ports susmentionnes, fourni des certificats, dresses en due forme et delivres par les officiers de la place du depart, afin que 1'on puisse savoir si les dits batiments sont porteurs d'articles de contrebande. Et, s'il n'appert pas de ces certificats qu'il existe a bord des articles de contrebande, les batiments seront busses libres de poursuivre leur voyage. S'il resulte, au contraire, de ces certificats que des articles de contrebande existent sur un tel navire, et si le commandant de ce navire offre de s'en dessaisir, cette offre sera acceptee, il lui en sera delivre recu et le navire sera laisse libre de continuer son voyage, a moins que les articles de contrebande ne soient en trop grande quantite pour pouvoir etre commodement regus a bord du navire de guerre ou du corsaire. Dans ce dernier cas, comme dans tous les autres cas d'une juste detention, le navire sera dirige sur le port le plus voisin, le plus sur et le plus convcnable pour la delivrance des dits articles.
Dans le cas ou un batiment n'aura pas ete muni d'un passe-port ou de certificats, dont il est necessaire qu'il soit pourvu d'apres ce que dessus, un tel cas sera examine par un juge ou un tribunal competent ; et s'il appert d'autres documents ou d'autres preuves, admissibles suivant les us et coutumes des nations, que le batiment appartient aux citoyens ou aux sujets de la partie neutre, il ne sera pas confisque, mais sera relache avec son chargement (les articles de contrebande exceptes) et sera laisse libre de poursuivre son voyage.

Afin de prevenir tout desordre dans la visite et 1'examen des batiments et des cargaisons des deux parties contractantes sur les hautes mers, il est ici convenu, que, lorsqu'un navire de guerre rencontrera un batiment neutre de 1'autre partie contractante, le premier se tiendra a une distance convenable, et enverra sa chaloupe avec seulement deux ou trois hommes, pour qu'ils effectuent 1'examen des papiers relatifs a la propriety du batiment et de son chargement, sans se livrer a aucune exaction, violence ou mauvais traitement, ce dont les commandants des dits navires armes seront respbnsables de leurs personnes et de leurs biens. Pour cet effet les commandants de tous navires prives armes devront, avant de recevoir leurs commissions, fournir une garantie suffisante pour repondre de tons les dommages qu'ils pourront occasioner; et il est ici convenu et entendu que la partie neutre ne sera, dans aucun cas, appelee sur le navire visitant, ni pour la presentation de ses papiers ni pour aucun autre motif quelconque.

Il est expressement convenu entre les deux hautes parties contractantes que les stipulations ci-dessus concernant la con finite a tenir sur mer par les croiseurs de la partie belligerante envers les batiments de la partie neutre ne seront applicables qu'aux batiments voyageant sans convoi; que lorsque les dits batiments seront convoyes, 1'intention des parties etant d'observer tous les egards dtxs a la protection du pavilion qui flotte sur les navires publics, il ne sera pas permis de les visiter; mais que la declaration verbale du commandant du convoi, que les batiments escortes par lui appartiennent a la nation, dont il porte le pavilion et n'ont a leur bord aucun article de contrebande, sera consideree comme entierement suffisante par les croiseurs respectifs, les deux parties s'engageant reciproquement a ne pas admettre sous la protection de leurs convois des batiments qui seraient porteurs d'articles de contrebande destines a un ennemi.
