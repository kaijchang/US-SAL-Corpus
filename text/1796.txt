cause, without delay, to survey and mark the unascertained outlines of the lands lying northwest of the river Ohio, and above the mouth of the river Kentucky, in which the titles of the Indian tribes have been extinguished, and to divide the same in the manner herein after directed; he shall have authority to frame regulations and instructions for the government of his deputies; to administer the necessary oaths, upon their appointments; and to remove them for negligence or misconduct in
office.(a) Sec . 2. Be it further enacted, That the part of the said lands,

(a) The decisions of the courts ofthe United States, as to the principles which regulate the titles to the public lands, in the states which form part of the territory northwest of the river Ohio, have been :
A title to lands under grants by Indian titles northwest of the river Ohio, to private individuals in the years 1773 and 1775, cannot be sustained in the courts of the United States. Lessee of Johnson et al. v.
M'Intosh, 8 Wheat. 543; 5 Cond. Rep. 515. The title to land depends entirely on the laws of the nation in which they lie. Ibid. Discovery constitutes the original title to landsonthe American continent, as between the different Euro-
pean nations. The title thus derived was the exclusive right of acquiring the soil from the natives, and establishing settlements upon it. The title was to be consummated by possession. Ibid.
The right of the original inhabitants, was to a considerable extent impaired, but in no instance disregarded. The Europeans respected the right of the natives as occupants, but asserted the ultimate dominion to be in themselves; and claimed and exercised as a consequence of this ultimate dominion, a power to grant the soil while yet in the possession of the natives. Ibid.
By the treaty between Great Britain and the United States, which concluded the revolution, the powers of government and the right of soil, which had been previously in Great Britain, passed definitely to the
United States. Ibid. The United States, or the several states, have a clear title to all the lands within the boundary lines
described in the treaty; subject only to the Indian right of occupancy : and the exclusive power to extinguish that right, was vested in the United States, which might constitutionally exercise it. Ibid.
It is a principle of universal law, that if an uninhabited country be discovered by a number of individuals, who acknowledge no connection with, and own no allegiance to any government whatever, the country becomes the property of the discoverers, so far as they can use it. Ibid.
If the discovery be made, and possession be taken under the authority of an existing government which is acknowledged by the emigrants, the discovery is made for the whole nation ; and the country becomes a part of the'nation, and the vacant soil is to be disposed of by that organ of the government which has the constitutional power to dispose of the national domain. Ibid.
The decision of the register and receiver of a land-office, in the absence of fraud, would be conclusive as to the facts that the applicant for the land was then in possession, and of his cultivating the land during the preceding year; because these questions are directly submitted to those officers. Yet if they undertake to grant pre-emptions to land, on which the law declares they shall not be granted, then they are acting on a subject matter clearly not within their jurisdiction ; as much so, as if a court whose jurisdiction was declared not to extend beyond a given sum, should attempt cognizance of a case beyond that sum. Wilcox v. Jackson, 13 Peters, 498.
Appropriation of land by the government, is nothing more or less than setting it apart for some peculiar use. Whenever a tract of land has been once legally appropriated to any purpose, from that moment the land thus appropriated becomes severed from the mass of public lands : and no subsequent law or proclamation, or sale, would be construed to embrace it, or to operate upon it, although no other
reservation were made of it. Ibid. Nothing passes a perfect title to public lands, with the exception of a few cases, but a patent. The
exceptions are where Congress grants lands in words of present grant. The general rule applies as well to pre-emptions, as to other purchases of public land. Ibid.
A state has a perfect right to legislate as she may please, in regard to the remedies to be prosecuted in her courts, and to regulate the disposition of the property of her citizens, by descent, devise or alienation. But Congress are invested by the constitution with the power of disposing of the public land, and making needful rules and regulations concerning it. Ibid.
Where a patent has not been issued for a part of the public land, a state has no power to declare any title less than a patent valid against the claim of the United States to the land; or against a title held under a patent from the United States. Ibid.
Whenever the question in any court, state or federal, is whether the title to property which had belonged to the United States, has passed, that question must be resolved by the laws of the United States. But whenever the property has passed, according to those laws, then the property, like all other in the state, is subject to state legislation ; so far as that legislation is consistent with the admission that the title passed, and was vested according to the laws of the United States. Ibid.
Congress has the sole power to declare the dignity and effect of titles emanating from the United States ; and the whole legislation ofthe government, in reference to public lands, declares the patent to be the superior and conclusive evidence of legal title. Until it issues, the fee is in the government, which by the patent passes to the grantee, and he is entitled to recover the possession by ejectment. Bagnell v. Bro-
derick, 13 Peters, 436. Where the title to the public land has passed out of the United States by conflicting patents, there can
be no objection to the practice adopted by the courts of a state, to give effect to the better right in any form of remedy the legislature or courts of the state may prescribe.
No doubt is entertained, of the power of the states to pass laws authorizing purchasers of lands from the United States, to prosecute actions of ejectment upon certificates of purchase against trespassers on the lands purchased ; but it is denied that the states have any power to declare certificates of purchase, of equal dignity with a patent. Congress alone can give them such effect. Ibid.

The corners of the townships shall be marked with progressive numbers from the beginning; each distance of a mile between the said corners shall be also distinctly marked with marks different from those of the corners. One half of the said townships, taking them alternately, shall be subdivided into sections, containing, as nearly as may be, six hundred and forty acres each, by running through the same, each way, parallel lines, at the end of every two miles; and by marking a corner, on each of the said lines, at the end of every mile; the sections shall be numbered respectively, beginning with the number one, in the northeast section, and proceeding west and east alternately, through the township with progressive numbers, till the thirty-sixth be completed. And it shall be the duty of the deputy surveyors, respectively, to cause to be marked, on a tree near each corner made, as aforesaid, and within the section, the number of such section, and over it, the number of the township, within which such section may be; and the said deputies shall carefully note, in their respective field-books, the names of the corner trees marked, and the numbers so made : The fractional parts of townships shall be divided into sections, in manner aforesaid, and the fractions of sections shall be annexed to, and sold with, the adjacent entire sections.

Every surveyor shall note in his field-book the true situations of all mines, salt licks, salt springs and mill seats, which shall come to his knowledge; all water courses, over which the line he runs shall pass; and also the quality of the lands. These field-books shall be returned to the Surveyor General, who shall therefrom cause a description of the whole lands surveyed, to be made out and transmitted to the officers who may superintend the sales: He shall also cause a fair plat to be made of the townships, and fractional parts of townships, contained in the said lands, describing the subdivisions thereof, and the marks of' the corners. This plat shall be recorded in books to be kept for that purpose; a copy thereof shall be kept open at the Surveyor General's office, for public information; and other copies sent to the places of the sale, and to the Secretary of the Treasury.
Sec . 3. Be it further enacted, That a salt spring lying upon a creek which empties into the Sciota river, on the east side, together with as many contiguous sections as shall be equal to one township, and every other salt spring which may be discovered, together with the section of one mile square which includes it, and also four sections at the centre of every township, containing each one mile square, shall be reserved, for the future disposal of the United States; but there shall be no reservations, except for salt springs, in fractional townships, where the fraction is less than three fourths of a township.
Sec . 4. Be it further enacted, That whenever seven ranges of townships shall have been surveyed below the Great Miami, or between the Sciota river and the Ohio company's purchase, or between the southern boundary of the Connecticut claims and the ranges already laid off

" Whereas by the third article of the treaty of amity, commerce and navigation, concluded at London, on the nineteenth day of November, one thousand seven hundred and ninety-four, between his Britannic Majesty and the United States of America, it was agreed that it should at all times be free to his Majesty's subjects and to the citizens of the United States, and also to the Indians dwelling on either side of the boundary line, assigned by the treaty of peace to the United States, freely to pass and repass by land or inland navigation, into the respective territories and countries of the two contracting parties, on the continent of America, (the country within the limits of the Hudson's Bay company only excepted) and to navigate all the lakes, rivers and waters thereof, and freely to carry on trade and commerce with each other, subject to the provisions and limitations contained in the said article: And whereas by the eighth article of the treaty of peace and friendship concluded at Greenville, on the third day of August, one thousand seven hundred and ninety-five, between the United States and the nations or tribes of Indians, called the Wyandots, Delawares, Shawanoes, Ottawas, Chippewas, Putawatimies, Miamis, Eel-River, Weeas, Kickapoos, Piankashaws and Kaskaskias, it was stipulated that no person should be permitted to reside at any of the towns or hunting camps of the said Indian tribes, as a trader, who is not furnished with a licence for that purpose, under the authority of the United States: Which latter stipulation has excited doubts, whether in its operation it may not interfere with the due execution of the said third article of the treaty of amity, commerce and navigation : And it being the sincere desire of his Britannic Majesty and of the United States, that this point should be so explained, as to remove all doubts, and promote mutual satisfaction and friendship: And for this purpose, his Britannic Majesty having named for his commissioner, Phineas Bond, Esquire, his Majesty's Consul General for the middle and southern states of America, (and now his Majesty's Charge d'Affaires to the United States) and the President of the United States having named for their commissioner, Timothy Pickering, Esquire, Secretary of State of the United States, to whom, agreeably to the laws of the United States, he has intrusted this negotiation ; They, the said commissioners, having communicated to each other their full powers, have, in virtue of the same, and conformably to the spirit of the last article of the said treaty of amity, commerce and navigation, entered into this explanatory article, and do by these presents explicitly agree and declare, That no stipulations in any treaty subsequently concluded by either of the contracting parties with any other state or nation, or with any Indian tribe, can be understood to derogate in any manner from the rights of free intercourse and commerce, secured by the aforesaid third article of the treaty of amity, commerce and navigation, to the subjects of his Majesty and to the citizens of the United States, and to the Indians dwelling on either side of the boundary line aforesaid; but that all the said persons shall remain at full liberty freely to pass and repass by land or inland navigation, into the respective territories and countries of the contracting parties, on either side of the said boundary line, and freely to carry on trade and commerce with

each other, according to the stipulations of the said third article of the treaty of amity, commerce and navigation.
This explanatory article, when the same shall have been ratified by his Majesty, and by the President of the United States, by and with the advice and consent of their Senate, and the respective ratifications mutually exchanged, shall be added to, and make a part of the said treaty of amity, commerce and navigation, and shall be permanently binding upon his Majesty and the United States.
In wi tness whereof, we, the said Commissioners of his Majesty, the King of Great-Britain and the United States of America, have signed this present explanatory article, and thereto affixed our seals.

Exp lan ato ry Arti cle , to be added to the treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation, between the United States and his Britannic
Majesty.
Whereas by the twenty-eighth Article of the Treaty of Amity, Com-
merce and Navigation, between his Britannic Majesty and the United States, signed at London the nineteenth day of November, one thousand seven hundred and ninety-four, it was agreed, that the contracting parties would from time to time, readily treat of and concerning such
further articles, as might be proposed, that they would sincerely en-
deavour so to form such articles, as that they might conduce to mutual convenience, and tend to promote mutual satisfaction and friendship;
and that such articles, after having been duly ratified, should be added
to and make a part of that Treaty : And whereas difficulties have arisen with respect to the execution of so much of the Fifth Article of the said treaty, as requires that the commissioners, appointed under the same, should in their description particularize the latitude and longitude of the source of the river, which may be found to be the one truly intended in the treaty of peace between his Britannic Majesty and the
United States, under the name of the river St. Croix, by reason whereof it is expedient, that the said commissioners should be released from the obligation of conforming to the provisions of the said article in this respect. The undersigned being respectively named by his Britannic
Majesty and the United States of America, their plenipotentiaries for the purpose of treating of and concluding such articles as may be proper to be added to the said treaty, in conformity to the above-mentioned stipulation, and having communicated to each other their respective full powers, have agreed and concluded, and do hereby declare in the name of his Britannic Majesty and of the United States of America--That the commissioners appointed under the 5th article of the above-mentioned treaty shall not be obliged to particularize, in their description,
the latitude and longitude of the source of the river, which may be found to be the one truly intended in the aforesaid treaty of peace, under the name of the river St. Croix, but they shall be at liberty to describe the said river, in such other manner, as they may judge expedient, which description shall be considered as a compleat execution of the duty required of the said commissioners in this respect by the arti-
cle aforesaid. And to the end that no uncertainty may hereafter exist on this subject, it is further agreed, That as soon as may be after the decision of the said commissioners, measures shall be concerted be-
tween the government of the United States and his Britannic Majesty's

March 15,1798. The commissioners under the 5th article released from particularizing the latitude and longitude of the source of the river intended by the St. Croix.
