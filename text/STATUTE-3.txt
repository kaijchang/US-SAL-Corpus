best of his skill and judgment, and without unnecessary delay, execute and perform all the duties required of him as a commissioner, under the

Act of April 2265., 1810, chap.

sixth section of the act of Congress, entitled " An act to incorporate a company for making certain turnpike roads in the District of Columbia ;" which oaths or affirmations so subscribed and certified by the justice, in whose presence they shall be severally taken and subscribed, shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the said circuit court, and enrolled among the land records of the county of Washington ; and the

said commissioners, or any two of them, being qualified as aforesaid, shall, upon the request of the said president and directors, cause to be surveyed, laid out, and ascertained , described and marked, by certain metes and bounds of the aforesaid turnpike road, described in the first

section of this act, not less than sixty feet in breadth, in such routes, tracts or courses for the same respectively, as in the best of their judgment will combine shortness of distance with the most convenient ground

and the smallest expense of money ; and for this purpose it shall be lawful for them and such agents, assistants, servants, or attendants as they may think proper to employ, to enter upon any of the lands through

or near which the said road may be laid out, having first given twenty days' public notice in some public newspaper printed in the District of Columbia, of the time and place of their entering on the said business of surveying and laying out each road respectively : and if any proprietor of any part of the lands, through which the said road may be laid out,

shall require compensation for so much of his or her said land as may be occupied by the said road, or shall claim damages for or on account of the opening or laying out the said road through his or her land, and

if the said president and directors cannot agree with such proprietors respecting the same, then the said commissioners at the request of either

party, shall appoint a day and place to hear and decide upon such claim,

and the amount of compensation and damages which such proprietor shall be entitled to receive from the said president, directors and company thereof, first giving twenty days' notice to the adverse party, his or her agent or attorney in fact, or other legal representative, if either shall

be within the District of Columbia ; and if the party so notified shall

fail to attend, or if the party shall be an infant under age, non compos mentis, feme covert or absent out of the District of Columbia and have

no agent or legal representative therein, then the said commissioners may

proceed ex parte to hear and decide the same ; and the award of them or any two of them, made in writing signed by them or any two of them , shall by them be returned to the office of the clerk of the said court for the county of Washington, within ten days after such hearing, and a copy thereof shall within ten days after such return be served upon such of the parties as are residents in the District of Columbia ; and if such award be not at the session of the said circuit court, in the county of Washington, next after such return of the said award to the clerk's office , be set aside on account of fraud or partiality in the said commissioners, or other cause deemed sufficient in the opinion of the court, the same shall be final and conclusive between the parties, and shall be recorded by the said clerk ; and the sum so awarded being paid to the said clerk for the use of the person entitled to receive the same, the said land, mentioned and described in the said award, shall and may be taken and occupied as a turnpike road and public highway forever : and the said commissioners, upon completing the said survey of the said road, shall return a plat and certificate of such survey to the said clerk, and the same being accepted by the said court shall be recorded by the said clerk, and thereupon the road so laid out shall be taken, used and occupied as a turnpike road and public highway forever ; and the said president, directors and company may thereupon proceed to enter upon the same, and shall cause at least twenty-four feet in breadth, throughout the whole length thereof, to be made an artificial road of stone, gravel or other hard substance, of sufficient depth or thickness to secure a solid and firm road, with the surface as smooth as the materials will admit, and so nearly level that it shall in no case rise or fall more than an angle of four degrees with a horizontal line ; and the said road shall thereafter be kept in good and perfect repair ; and wheresoever upon the said road any bridge shall be deemed necessary, the same shall be built of sound and suitable materials. And in case either of the said commissioners
die or refuse to act, or become incapacitated, or shall be removed by the court for misconduct, the said court may appoint another in his place, and when in the opinion of the said president and directors, the said road shall be completed to the extent of twenty-four feet in breadth, the same shall be examined by the said commissioners or any two of them ; and if in the opinion of them or any two of them, the said road should have been completed to the extent of at least twenty-four feet in breadth, according to the meaning of this act, they shall certify the same to the said court, or the judges thereof out of court, and their certificate being accepted by the said court or any two judges thereof, and recorded, the said president and directors shall and may thereafter erect and fix one gate and turnpike upon and across the said road, to collect the tolls hereinafter granted to the said company ; and it shall be lawful for them to appoint such, and so many toll gatherers as they shall deem necessary to collect and receive of and from all and every person and persons using the said road, the tolls and rates hereinafter mentioned, and to stop any person or persons riding, leading or driving any horses, mules, cattle, hogs, sheep, sulky, chair, chaise, phaeton, chariot, coach, cart, wagon, sleigh, sled or any carriage of burden or pleasure, from passing through the said gate, until the said tolls shall be paid, that is to say : For every score

STATUTE I. CHAP. XIV.--An Act concerning suits and costs in courts of the United States.(a)
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the July 22, 1813. United States of America in Congress assembled, That whenever there When several shall be several actions or processes against persons who might legally actions are be joined in one action or process, touching any demand or matter in pberrosuognhst awghaionst dispute before a court of the United States or of the territories thereof, might be legally

(a) Decisions in the Courts ofthe United States , on the law of Costs.
1. The cost of printing a statement of the case for the Supreme Court, was refused to be allowed as part of the plaintiff's costs. Jennings et al. Plaintiffs in Error v. The Brig Perseverance , 3 Dall . 336 ; 1 Cond. Rep. 154.
2. On a writ of error to the High Court of Appeals of Maryland, the judgment of that court was reversed, and the judgment of the general court of Maryland was affirmed. The mandate of the Supreme Court was directed to the general court, and the costs ofthe Supreme Court and of the courts of Maryland were allowed to the plaintiff in error. Clarke, Plaintiff in Error v. Harwood, 3 Dall . 342 ; 1 Cond. Rep. 157.
3. Costs are not to be awarded against the United States. The United States v. Hooe et al. 3 Cranch, 73 ; 1 Cond. Rep. 458.
4. A judgment for costs, generally, includes all the costs belonging to the suit, whether prior or subsequent to the rendition ofthe judgment. Ifnew costs accrue, the judgment opens to receive them. Peyton v. Brooke, 3 Cranch, 92 ; 1 Cond. Rep. 464.
5. Costs were allowed upon the dismission of a writ of error for want of jurisdiction ; the original defendant being also defendant in error. Winchester v. Jackson et al. 3 Cranch, 514 ; 1 Cond. Rep. 612.
6. Where there appeared some ground for the prosecution, costs were refused . The United States v. La Vengeance, 3 Dall. 297 ; 1 Cond. Rep. 132.
7. Where a writ of error is dismissed in the Supreme Court for want of jurisdiction , costs are not allowed. Inglee v . Coolidge, 2 Wheat. 363 ; 4 Cond. Rep. 155.
8. Each party is liable to the clerk of the Supreme Court for the fees due to him from each party, respectively. Caldwell v. Jackson , 7 Cranch, 276 ; 2 Cond. Rep. 490.
9. A copy ofthe record is not a part of the taxable costs of suit, to be recovered by one party against the other; but the party who requests the copy, must pay the clerk for it. Ibid.
10. It is undoubtedly a general rule, that no court can give a direct judgment against the United States for costs, in a suit to which they are a party, either on behalf of any suitor, or any officer of the government. But it by no means follows, from this, that they are not liable for their own costs. No direct suit can be maintained against the United States. But when an action is brought by the United States, to recover money in the hands of a party, who has a legal claim against them for costs, it would be a very rigid principle, to deny to him the right of setting up such claim in a court of justice, and turn him round to an application to Congress. If the right of the party is fixed by the existing law, there can be no necessity for an application to Congress, except for the purpose of remedy. And no such necessity can exist, when this right can properly be set up by way of defence to a suit by the United States. U. S. v. Ringgold et al. 8 Peters, 150 .
11. The United States do not pay costs in any case. The U. S. v. Barker, 2 Wheat. 395 ; 4 Cond. Rep. 181.
12. No judgment or decree can be rendered directly against the United States for costs and expenses. The Antelope, 12 Wheat. 546 ; 6 Cond. Rep . 629.
14. The fees and compensation to the marshal, where the government is a party to the suit, and his fees or compensation are chargeable to the United States, are to be paid out of the treasury, upon a certificate of the amount, to be made by the court, or one of the judges. Ibid.
15. In cases of reversal, costs do not go of course ; but in cases of affirmance they do. When a
judgment is reversed for want ofjurisdiction , it must be without costs. Montalet v . Murray, 4 Cranch, 46 ; 2 Cond. Rep. 19.
16. The court below, upon a mandamus , on reversal of its judgment, may award execution for the costs ofthe appellant in that court. Riddle et al. v. Mandeville et al . 6 Cranch , 86 ; 2 Cond. Rep. 307.
17. Where the court ordered the costs to be paid of a former ejectment brought by the plaintiffs in the names of other persons, but for their use, before the plaintiff could prosecute a second suit in his own name for the same land ; this was not a judicial decision that the right of the plaintiffs in the first suit was the same with that of the plaintiffs in the second suit. It was perfectly consistent with the
justice of the case, that when the plaintiffs sued the same defendant in their own name for the same land, that they should reimburse him for the past costs to which they had subjected him, before they should be permitted to proceed further. Rules of this kind are granted by the court to meet the justice and exigencies of cases as they occur ; not depending solely on the interest which those who are subjected to such rules may have in the subject matter of suits which they bring and prosecute in the names of others ; but on a variety of circumstances , which, in the exercise of a sound discretion, may furnish a proper ground for their interference . Henderson and Wife v. Griffin , 5 Peters , 151 .
18. Where several claims had been filed by the district attorney, and, before any further proceedings in the cause, Congress remitted the forfeiture, on the payment of duties, costs, and charges : Held, that the district attorney of Massachusetts was entitled to seventeen dollars on each claim. The Francis, 1 Gallis. C. C. R. 453.
19. In taxing the costs in prize causes, where there are several claims, some of which are disposed of by a final decree of condemnation, while others are suspended by appeal , the practice is to tax the costs and expenses which have accrued , specially, upon each claim so disposed of, as a separate charge against the same, and to add thereto an average proportion of the general costs and expenses which have accrued in reference to all the claims in the cause. The Hiram and the Hero , 2 Gallis. C. C. R. 60.
20. In prize causes , the allowance or denial of costs rests in the discretion of the court ; and where

sued in one ac-
tion, costs can onlybe recovered as in one.
Costs to be recovered only in one libel when that is sufficient.

if judgment be given for the party pursuing the same, such party shall not thereon recover the costs of more than one action or process,unless special cause for several actions or processes shall be satisfactorily shown on motion in open court.
SEC. 2. Be it further enacted, That whenever proceedings shall be had on several libels against any vessel and cargo which might legally be joined in one libel before a court of the United States or of the territo-

the capture, though made in good faith, is in law adjudged tortious, the claimant is entitled by the general practice of the court to such costs as have necessarily arisen in the prosecution of his claim , unless he has been guilty of such misconduct as amounts to a forfeiture of such costs. The Ulpiano ,  Mason, 91 .
21. When a cause is removed from a state court to the circuit court, under the act of Congress, the
plaintiff is entitled to recover his costs ; although he obtains a verdict for less than five hundred dollars. Ellis v. Jarvis, 3 Mason , 457.
22. If a witness, recognised for the defendant, is marked on the indictment, and sent to the grand jury by the district attorney , the United States, on the acquittal of the prisoner, must pay the witness his costs. United States v. Coulter, C. C. U. S. of Pennsylvania, April, 1803.
23. It is within the discretion of the court to permit the defendant to file a new plea ; but where the effect of it would be to put the plaintiff out of court, and the cause was instituted in consequence of the act of the defendant himself, and had been long at issue before the application was made , the court would not permit it to be done , unless the defendant would pay not only the costs incurred since the filing ofhis first plea, but the whole costs ofthe action. Anonymous, 2 Wash. C. C. R. 270.
24. Where the plaintiff prevails in the action , the court will not , in the exercise of their discretion , tax the costs against him, where he might naturally and fairly suppose he was entitled to recover more than five hundred dollars. Cottle v. Payne , 3 Day, 289.
25. Costs and expenses are not matters positively limited by law, but are allowed in the exercise of a sound discretion of the court ; and no appeal lies from a mere decree respecting costs and expenses. Canter v. The American and Ocean Insurance Company, 3 Peters , 319.
26. In Virginia, if the first ca. sa. be returned non est, the second may include the costs of issuing both. Peyton v. Brooke , 3 Cranch, 92 ; 1 Cond. Rep . 464.
27. Costs will be allowed on the dismission of a writ of error for want of jurisdiction , if the original defendant be defendant in error. Winchester v. Jackson et al . 3 Cranch, 515 ; 1 Cond. Rep . 612.
28. A party who obtains a continuance of a cause, must pay the costs of the term. Lessee of Patton v. Blackwell , 2 Overt. Rep. 114.
29. The Supreme Court has no jurisdiction in a case in which the judges of the circuit court have divided in opinion, upon a motion for a rule to show cause why the taxation of the costs ofthe marshal on an execution should not be reversed. Bank ofthe United States v. Green and others, 6 Peters , 26.
30. The transcript of the record had been lodged by the plaintiffs in error with the clerk of the court on the 24th of October, 1835 ; who refused to file it or docket the cause, until the plaintiffs had given the fee bond in pursuance ofthe thirty-seventh rule of the court. The counsel for the plaintiffs in error
moved to have the transcript filed and docketed ; alleging they had done all the law required to be done in order to bring the case before the Supreme Court. On the part of the defendant in error, his counsel filed and read in open court certified copies of the writ of error, citation and appeal bond, and of the judgment ofthe circuit court ; and having stated that the plaintiffs in error had failed to have the case docketed according to the thirtieth rule of the court, they moved to have the case docketed and dismissed. The court overruled the motion to docket and dismiss the cause ; and also the motion to have the transcript filed, and the cause docketed without the fee bond being first given. These motions were overruled on the 18th of January , 1836 ; and the court allowed the plaintiffs in error until the 1st day of March following to give to the clerk the fee bond : on the failure so to give the same , the writ of error to be dismissed .

The clerk of the circuit court for the district of Pennsylvania cannot charge in the bill of costs any compensation for the travel and attendance of the successful party, none such being allowed in the supreme court of the state.

Ibid.
Where a certificate made by the agent ofthe owner of the particular times of the sailing and returning of a vessel engaged in the cod fisheries was discovered to be incorrect and false after the payment of the bounties, it was held that if the incorrectness and falsity were by mistake, there was no forfeiture under the acts of 1813 and 1819, but if by fraud and deceit there was.

The forfeiture of a fishing vessel , under the act of July 29, 1813, for fraudulently obtaining the fishing
bounty, does not attach on the improvident payment of the bounty to a vessel not entitled to it, bu. to the act of fraud and deceit in obtaining it. The Boat Swallow, Ware's D. C. R. 21.
If a vessel be in fact entitled to the bounty, and fraud and deceit are employed in obtaining it, she will be subject to forfeiture. Ibid.

The owner is not precluded from showing that the errors of the certificate arose from an innocent mistake. Ibid.
If the errors in the certificate are proved to have arisen from mistake without fraud, the owner may, to avoid a forfeiture, show that the vessel was employed on other days than those named in the certificate. Ibid.

States v. Baily, 1 McLean's C. C. R. 234. Congress have a right to select the means which have a direct relation to the object, in the regula-
tion of commerce with the Indians. Such are the provisions of the act of 1802. Ibid.
But Congress cannot under this investure of power exercise a general jurisdiction over an Indian territory within a state. In a territory of the United States , in which Congress possesses legislative power, there can be no objection to the exercise of the power. Ibid.
Congress cannot punish for an offence, within the Indian territory, in a state, which has no relation to the Indians, and which cannot affect their commerce. Ibid.
The act of March 3 , 1817 , ch. 92 , which assumes to exercise a general jurisdiction over Indian countries, within a state, is unconstitutional and of no effect. Ibid.

CHAP. LXXVII.- An Act to protect the commerce of the United States, and punish the crime of piracy. (a)
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America, in Congress assembled, That the President of the United States be, and hereby is, authorized and requested to employ

(a) The decisions of the courts of the United States upon prosecutions for piracy, have been : Piracy. A robbery committed on the high seas , although such robbery, ifcommitted on land, would not, by the laws of the United States, be punishable with death, is piracy, under the act of Congress of 1790 ; and the circuit courts have jurisdiction thereof. United States v. Palmer, 3 Wheat. 610 ; 4 Cond. Rep. 352. The crime of robbery, as mentioned in the act, is the crime of robbery as recognised and defined at common law. Ibid.
The crime of robbery, committed by a person who is not a citizen of the United States, on the high seas, on board of a ship belonging exclusively to subjects of a foreign state, or on persons in a foreign vessel, is not piracy under the act, and is not punishable in the courts of the United States. Ibid.
When a civil war rages in a foreign nation , one part of which separates itself from the old established government, and erects itself into a distinct government, the courts of the United States must view such newly constituted government as it is viewed by the legislative and executive departments of the government of the United States. Ifthat government remains neutral, but recognises the existence of a civil war, the courts of the Union cannot consider as criminal, those acts of hostility which war authorizes, and which the new government may direct against its enemy. Ibid.
The same testimony which would be sufficient to prove that a vessel or person is in the service of an acknowledged state, is admissible to prove that they are in the service of such newly created government. 1ts seal cannot be allowed to prove itself, but may be proved by such testimony as the
nature of the case admits ; and the fact that a vessel or person is in the service of such government may be established otherwise , should it be impracticable to prove the seal. Ibid.
A commission issued by Aury, as " brigadier of the Mexican republic ," (a republic whose existence is unknown and unacknowledged ,) or as " generalissimo of the Floridas," (a province in the possession of Spain,) will not authorize armed vessels to make captures at sea. United States v. Klintock, 5 Wheat. 144 ; 4 Cond. Rep. 614.

sels to protect

Query, Whether a person, acting with good faith under such a commission, may be guilty of piracy ? Ibid.
However this may be, in general, under the particular circumstances of this case, showing that the seizure was made not jure belli , but animo furandi, the commission was held not toexemptthe prisoner from the charge of piracy. Ibid.
The act of the 30th of April, 1790, ch. 9, extends to all persons, on board all vessels, which throw off their national character by cruising piratically, and committing piracy on other vessels . Ibid.
The act of the 3rd March , 1819, ch. 77 , sec. 5, referring to the law of nations for a definition of the crime of piracy, is a constitutional exercise of the power of Congress to define and punish that crime. United States v. Smith, 5 Wheat. 153 ; 4 Cond. Rep. 619.
The crime of piracy is defined by the law of nations with reasonable certainty. Ibid. Robbery, or forcible depredation, upon the sea, animo furandi , is piracy by the law of nations, and by the act of Congress. Ibid. The eighth section of the act of the 30th of April, 1790, ch. 9, for the punishment of certain crimes against the United States, is not repealed by the act of the 3d of March, 1819 , ch. 77, to protect the commerce of the United States , and to punish the crime of piracy. United States v. Furlong, alias Hobson et al. , 5 Wheat. 184 ; 4 Cond. Rep . 623. In an indictment for a piratical murder (under the act of the 30th of April , 1790 , ch. 9 , sec . 8) , it is not necessary that it should allege the prisoner to be a citizen of the United States, nor that the crime was committed on board a vessel belonging to citizens of the United States ; but it is sufficient to charge it as committed from on board such a vessel , by a mariner sailing on board such a vessel. Ibid. The words " out of the jurisdiction of any particular state," in the act of the 30th of April, 1790, ch. 9, sec. 8, are construed to mean, out of the jurisdiction of any particular state of the Union. Ibid. A vessel lying in an open roadstead of a foreign country, is " upon the high seas" within the act of 1790 , ch. 9, sec . 8. Ibid. A citizen of the United Statos fitting out a vessel in a port of the United States, to cruise against a power in amity with the United States, is not protected by a foreign commission from punishment for any offence committed against the property of citizens of the United States. Ibid. The courts of the United States have jurisdiction of a murder committed on the high seas from a vessel belonging to the United States, by a foreigner being on board such vessel, upon another foreigner being on board of a foreign vessel. It is not necessary to produce documentary evidence , in order to prove the national character of a vessel , on an indictment for piracy. Ibid. The courts of the United States have not jurisdiction of a murder committed by one foreigner on another foreigner, both being on board a foreign vessel. Ibid. It is competent in an indictment for piracy, for the jury to find that a vessel within a marine league of the shore, at anchor, in an open roadstead , where vessels only ride under shelter of the land at a season when the course of the winds is invariable, is upon the high seas. Ibid.
The act of the 3d of March, 1819 , ch. 77 , sec . 5 , furnishes a sufficient definition of piracy ; and it is defined to be " robbery on the seas." Ibid.
A vessel loses her national character by assuming a piratical character ; and a piracy committed by a foreigner from on board such a vessel, upon any other vessel whatever , is punishable under the eighth section of the act of the 30th of April , 1790, ch. 9. Ibid.
On an indictment for piracy, the jury may find the national character of a vessel upon such evidence as will satisfy their minds ; without the certificate of registry, or other documentary evidence , being produced ; and without proof of their having been seen on board. Ibid.
On an indictment for piracy, the national character of a merchant vessel of the United States may be proved without evidence of her certificate of registry. Ibid.
The courts of the United States have jurisdiction under the act of the 30th of April , 1790, ch. 9, of murder or robbery committed on the high seas ; although not committed on board a vessel belonging to citizens of the United States , as if she had no national character ; but was held by pirates, or persons not lawfully sailing under the flag of any foreign nation. United States v. Holmes, 5 Wheat. 412 ; 4 Cond. Rep. 708.
In the same case, and under the same act, if the offence be committed on board of a foreign vessel by a citizen of the United States ; or on board a vessel of the United States by a foreigner ; or by a citizen or foreigner on board of a piratical vessel ; the offence is equally cognisable bythe courts of the United States. Ibid.
It makes no difference in such a case , and under the same act, whether the offence was committed on board of a vessel , or on the sea ; as by throwing the deceased overboard and drowning him, or by shooting him when in the sea though he was not thrown overboard. Ibid.
In such a case, and under the same act, where the vessel from on board of which the offence was committed, sailed from Buenos Ayres, where she had enlisted her crew ; but it did not appear by legal proof that she had a commission from the government of Buenos Ayres, or any ships' papers or documents from that government, or that she was ever recognised as a ship of that nation , or of its subjects, or who were the owners, where they resided, or when or where the vessel was armed and equipped ; but it did appear in proof, that the captain and crew were chiefly Englishmen , Frenchmen , and citizens of the United States ; that the captain was by birth a citizen of the United States, domiciled at Baltimore, where the privateer was built : Held, that the burthen of proof of the national character of the vessel, was on the prisoners. Ibid.
General piracy, or murder, or robbery, committed by persons on board a vessel , not at the time belonging to the subjects of any foreign power, but in possession of a crew, acting in defiance of all law, and acknowledging obedience to no government whatever, is within the 8th section of the act

The President SEC. 2. And be it further enacted, That the President of the United authorized to instruct com- States be, and hereby is, authorized to instruct the commanders of the pubmanders of public armed vessels of the United States to subdue, seize, take, and send into lic armed ves- any port of the United States, any armed vessel or boat, or any vessel or sels to take and
of Congress of April 30th, 1790, ch. 9, and is punishable in the courts of the United States. United States v. Furlong, 5 Wheat. 185 ; 4 Cond . Rep. 623.
There is a distinction between the crimes of murder and piracy. The latter is an offence within the criminal jurisdiction of all nations : not so with murder, it is punishable under the laws of each state. Ibid.
It is not necessary to produce documentary evidence, to prove the national character of a vessel, on an indictment for piracy. Ibid.
Upon a piratical capture, the property of the original owners cannot be forfeited for the misconduct of the captors, in violating the municipal laws of the country where the captors have carried the property. The Josefa Segunda , 5 Wheat. 338 ; 4 Cond. Rep. 672.
Pirates may be lawfully captured by the public or private ships of any nation, in peace or in war ; for they are hostes humani generis. The Marianna Flora, 11 Wheat. 1 ; 6 Cond. Rep . 201 .
On a question of probable cause of seizure, under the piracy acts of 3d of March, 1819, ch. 77, and of the 15th of May, 1820, ch. 113 ; although the crew may be protected by a commission bona fide received, and acted under, from the consequences attaching to the offence of piracy by the general law of nations ; although such commission was irregularly issued ; yet if the defects in the commission be such as, connected with the insubordination and predatory spirit of the crew, to excite a justly founded suspicion, it is sufficient, under the act of Congress , to justify the captors for bringing in the vessel for
adjudication, and to exempt them from costs and damages. The Palmyra, 12 Wheat. 1 ; 6 Cond. Rep. 397. Whatever difficulty there may be, under our municipal institutions, in punishing as pirates, citizens
of the United States who take from a state at war with Spain , a commission to cruise against that power, contrary to the 14th article of the Spanish treaty : yet there is no doubt that such acts are to be considered as piratical acts for all civil purposes, and the offending parties cannot appear, and claim in our courts the property thus taken . The Bello Corrunes, 6 Wheat. 152 ; 5 Cond. Rep. 45.
To constitute the offence of piracy, within the act of 1790, ch. 9, by " piratically and feloniously" running away with a vessel , personal force and violence is not necessary. United States v. Tully, 1 Gallis, C. C. R. 247.
The piratically and feloniously" running away with a vessel , within the act, is the running away with a vessel, with an intent to convert the same to the taker's own use, against the will of the owner. The intent must be animo furandi. Ibid.
The circuit court has cognisance , under the act of 1790 , ch. 9 , sec. 8, of piracy on board an American ship, although committed in an open roadstead, adjacent to a foreign territory, and within half a mile of the shore. United States v. Ross, 1 Gallis. C. C. R. 624.
Where the defendant was indicted for robbery and piracy, on the high seas, on board a brig called L'Eclair, a foreign vessel, belonging exclusively to French owners, and sailing under the French flag : Held, that under the acts of Congress, the circuit court had no jurisdiction to try and punish the offence. United States v. Kessler , 1 Baldwin's C. C. R. 25.
Whether the offence was committed within or without a marine league of the coast of the United States, makes no difference. Ibid.
The defendant who was the first lieutenant of an American privateer, the Revenge , was indicted for piracy committed on a Portuguese vessel , and for assaulting the crew, and putting them in bodily fear, &c. The defendant was charged with boarding the vessel , and by force and intimidation , taking from
her money and other articles, not claiming the vessel as prize ; but pretending that the Revenge was an English vessel, and that the articles would be paid for by an order on the English consul. Held, that the eighth section of the act for the punishment of certain crimes, makes murder and robbery on the high seas acts of piracy. The words, " which if committed in the body of a county," do not relateto " murder and robbery," but to the words immediately preceding them, or any other offence. United States v. Jones , 3 Wash. C. C. R. 209.
To define the meaning of " robbery," the common law must be resorted to : wherever a statute of the United States uses a technical term, which is known, and its meaning clearly ascertained by the common law or civil law, from one or other of which it is obviously borrowed, it is proper to refer for its meaning to the source from which it is taken. Ibid.
The act of Congress of 1812 , for the government of the navy ofthe United States, does not repeal the provisions of the law relating to piracy, contained in the act of Congress passed 30th April, 1790. The general rule of law, that robbery on the high seas is piracy, has no exception or qualification in favour of commissioned privateers , in any act of Congress, in the common law, or in the law of nations. Robbery is the felonious taking of goods from the person of another ; or in his presence by violence ; or by putting him in fear, and against his will. Ibid.
As there was no proof under the indictment, that in the first instance any unlawful acts were meditated by the commander ofthe Revenge, and his officers ; it was held to be insufficient to charge the defendants, who were part of the crew, with piracy , by proving acts of robbery committed by the crew in general . It must be proved that the defendants, who were part of the crew, participated in the taking ; and that they did it feloniously. The captain of the Revenge may have been guilty of robbery, and those who executed his orders may have been innocent. Ibid.
The crimes of piracy mentioned in the 8th section of the act for the punishment of certain crimes, passed 30th April, 1790, are such as are committed by citizens of the United States, or on board of vessels of the United States ; and the 10th and 11th sections of the act, which refer to accessaries, refer to acts of piracy mentioned in the 8th section . United States v. Howard et al . , 3 Wash. C. C. R. 340.
An endeavour by a mariner to corrupt the master of a vessel , and to induce him to go over to pirates, is within the provisions of the eighth section of the law. Ibid.

The language of the 12th section of the law, implies compact and association with pirates, as well in relation to the past as to the future. Any intercourse with them which is calculated to promote their views, is within the provisions of the law. Ibid.
In order to affect all the officers and crew of a piratical vessel with guilt, the original voyage must have been undertaken with a piratical design ; and the officers and crew have acted upon such design; otherwise those only are guilty who co-operated actively in the piracy. United States v. Gibert, 2 Sumner's C. C. R. 19.
It would not be sufficient to affect them with such, if they had known the voyage was to be an illegal one, as in the slave trade, contrary to the laws of Spain. Ibid.
The simple fact of presence on board the piratical vessel, where there was no original piratical design, is not of itself sufficient to affect a party with the crime. All who are present, acting and assist-
ing in the piracy, are to be deemed principals. Ibid. The act of 1790, ch. 9, sec. 8, for the punishment of certain crimes, passed by Congress, as well as
the act of 1820, ch. 113, applies to all murders and robberies committed on board of, or upon American ships on the high seas. Ibid.
The indictment charged the piracy to have been committed "on the high seas within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States, and out of the jurisdiction of a particular state." Held , that this was a sufficient statement of the venue, without a further specification of the place. Ibid.
Under the act of Congress of 1819, ch. 77, any armed vessel may be seized which shall have attempted or committed any piratical aggression, &c. , and the proceeds of the vessel when sold divided between
the United States and the captors at the discretion of the court. Harmony et al. v. The United States, 2 Howard, 210.
It is no matter whether the vessel be armed for offence or defence , provided she commits the unlawful acts specified. Ibid.
To bring a vessel within the act, it is not necessary that there should be actual plunder or intent to plunder ; if the act be committed from hatred or an abuse of power, or a spirit of mischief, it is sufficient. Ibid.
The word " piratical" in the act is not to be limited in its construction to such acts as by the laws of nations are denominated piracy, but includes such as pirates are in the habit of committing. Ibid.
A piratical aggression , search, restraint or seizure, is as much within the act, as a piratical depredation. Ibid.
The innocence or ignorance on the part of the owner of the vessel, of these prohibited acts, will not exempt the vessel from condemnation. Ibid.
The condemnation of the cargo is not authorized by the act of 1819. Neither does the law of nations require the condemnation of the cargo for petty offences, unless the owner thereof co-operates in and authorizes the unlawful act. An exception exists in the enforcement of belligerent rights. Ibid.
Where the innocence of the owners was established, it was proper to throw the costs on the vessel
which was condemned , to the exception of the cargo which was liberated. Ibid. VOL. III.-65

A vessel is " at sea" within the intent of the acts of 1813 and 1819, when she is without the limits of any ports or harbours on the seacoast. Ibid.
Where a vessel was enrolled and licensed for the fisheries, and without an oath having been taken by all the owners to the ownership , as prescribed by the statutes of 1813 and 1819, and fraud and deceit were charged in procuring the bounty allowed by law to such vessels, it was held that it must be satisfactorily proved on the part of the United States, that the omission by the owners, who did not take the oath, was through fraud and deceit, and not through mistake, in order to render the vessel liable to forfeiture . Ibid.
Where a certificate made by the agent of the owner, of the particular time of sailing and returning of the vessel engaged in the cod fisheries, was discovered to be incorrect and false, after the bounty was received, it was held, that if the incorrectness and falsity were by mistake, there was no forfeiture under the acts of 1813 and 1819 ; but if by fraud and deceit, there was.

(a) The cases decided upon the provisions of this section are :

The Treasury Department of the United States, on the 14th of July, 1829, issued a warrant of dis-

tress, directed to the marshal of the District of Columbia, commanding him to levy and collect, by distress and sale of his goods and chattels, a sum of money alleged to be due to the United States, on

a treasury transcript, by Joseph Nourse late register of the treasury. This warrant was issued in pursuance ofthe 2d, 3d , and 4th sections ofthe act of May 15th, 1820, " providing for the better organization of the Treasury Department." Under the provisions of the 4th section of the act, Mr. Nourse

obtained an injunction from the chief justice of the District of Columbia to stay all further proceedings

on the said warrant. The bill presented by Mr. Nourse to the chief justice of the District of Columbia asserted that the United States was indebted to him for compensation for extra services he had rendered

to the United States , in a sum exceeding the amount claimed by the United States : which claim was

denied in the answer filed by the district attorney of the United States, both as to the legality and the amount of the claim.

The court determined that Mr. Joseph Nourse was entitled to compensation for the extra services

he had rendered to the government, in the agencies mentioned in the bill ; and appointed auditors to ascertain the value of his services and compensation, and to report thereon without delay. The report of the auditors allowed to the complainant a commission of two and a half per cent. on the sum

of nine hundred and forty-three thousand three hundred and eight dollars, and eighty-three cents, dis-

bursed by him in the several agencies in which he had been employed , leaving a balance due to him from the United States. The report was confirmed , and the injunction made perpetual.

The United States then instituted their suit against Joseph Nourse in the circuit court for the District

of Columbia, in the county of Washington, on an account authenticated according to law, by the proper accounting officers, being the same account, and claiming the same amount as in the warrant of

distress, and on which the decree of the Chief Justice was pronounced. It was agreed that the de-

fendant should have the benefit of the proceedings in that case, as if the same had been pleaded and given in evidence. The circuit court adjudged the proceedings inthe former action a bar to this action.

By the Court. It is a rule to which no exception is recollected , that the judgment of a court of

competent jurisdiction , while unreversed , concludes the subject-matter as between the same parties.

They cannot again bring it into litigation. The United States v. Nourse , 9 Peters' Rep. 8.

An execution is the end of the law. It gives the successful party the fruits of his judgment, and the distress warrant is a most effective execution . It may act on the body and estate of the individual against whom it is directed . Ibid.
It would excite some surprise if, in a government of laws and of principle, furnished with a department whose appropriate duty is to decide questions of right, not only between individuals , but between the government and individuals, a ministerial officer might, at his discretion , issue this powerful process, and levy on the person , lands , and chattels of the debtor, any sum he might believe to be due, leaving to that debtor no remedy, no appeal to the laws of his country , if he should believe the claim to be unjust. But this anomaly does not exist ; this imputation cannot be cast on the legislature of the United States. Ibid.
Under the act of Congress the chief justice of the District of Columbia had full jurisdiction over the case. Ibid.
After a reference to auditors , according to the course of courts of chancery in matters of account, a final decree was pronounced against the United States, and a perpetual injunction awarded. This decree is now in full force , and was in force when this suit was instituted . The act of Congress gave jurisdiction in the specific case to the district judge. He might have enjoined the whole or a part of the warrant. His decree might have been for or against the United States for the whole or a part of the claim . On the sum which he found to be due, he is directed to assess the lawful interest ; he may add such damages, as with the interest, shall not exceed the rate of ten per cent. per annum on the principal sum. Had the district judge finally enjoined a part of the sum claimed by the United States, and decreed that the residue should be paid with interest, all would perceive the unfitness of asserting a claim in a new action to that portion of the debt which had been enjoined by the decree of the court. And, yet between the obligation of a decree, against the whole claim, and against a part of it, no distinction is perceived . Ibid.
The relief which is given by the act of Congress on which the warrant of distress may be issued, by application to any district judge of the United States for an injunction to stay proceedings on such warrant, is not confined to an officer employed in the civil, military, or naval departments of the government, to disburse the public money appropriated for the service of those departments respectively, who shall fail to render his accounts, or pay over in the manner required by law, any sum of money remaining in the hands of such officer. Ibid.
When the legislature turns its attention to the individual against whom the warrant may issue, the language of the law is immediately changed . The word person is substituted for officer ; and it declares, " that if any person should consider himself aggrieved by any warrant issued under this act, he may prefer a bill of complaint, & c.," and thereupon the judge may grant an injunction, &c. Ibid.
The character of the individual against whom the warrant may be issued is entirely disregarded by that part of the law. Be he whom he may, an officer or not an officer, a debtor or not a debtor ; if the warrant be levied on his person or property, he is permitted to appeal to the laws of his country, and to bring his case before the district judge , to be adjudicated by him. Ibid.
The district judge had full jurisdiction over the case , and his decision is final. The judgment on the warrant of distress, and the proceedings upon it are, consequently, a bar to any subsequent action for the same cause. Ibid.
A party was arrested and held in custody, by virtue of a distress warrant, issued from the Treasury Department, under an act ofCongress passed the 15th of May, 1820, " to provide for the better organization ofthe Treasury Department." The act provides , in substance, for the issuing of this warrant bythe agent of the treasury, against all military and naval officers, &c. , charged with the disbursement ofthe public moneys, who shall fail to pay and settle their accounts at the Treasury Department. The party in custody, was a lieutenant in the navy of the United States, and had officiated as acting purser of a national ship, supplying a vacancy occasioned by the death of the regularly commissioned purser of the ship, on the Mediterranean station , and had executed no official bond as purser. On his return to
the United States, he had settled his account at the proper department, viz. , in 1828 ; and in 1833 , the then fourth auditor, opened and re-stated his account, on the ground that it had been erroneously settled in the first instance, and the account as re-stated, exhibited a large balance against the party, due to the United States. Upon this re-stated account, the distress warrant was issued, by virtue whereof,
the party was arrested and was brought before the circuit court under a writ of habeas corpus, directed to the officer, who executed the warrant, and held the petitioner in custody. Held, That the account ofthe petitioner as acting purser, having been once stated , and settled at the Treasury Department, the law invests the auditor with no power to open and re-settle it, of his own mere authority. The act creates a special and limited jurisdiction ; and after the accounts of any class of officers, on whom it was intended to act, have been adjusted, however erroneously, that special jurisdiction is functus officio, and any process issued upon a re-establishment of such accounts, is absolutely null and void.
BARBOUR, J. That, assuming that the act, under which this arrest was made , does not violate the Constitution of the United States, which declares, that " the judicial power of the United States shall be vested in one supreme court, and in such inferior courts as Congress shall , from time to time, ordain and establish ; the judges , both of the supreme and inferior courts, shall hold their offices during good behaviour," and extends the judicial power to " controversies to which the United States shall be a party :" yet, the authority vested by this law in certain agents of the treasury, and all acts done in pursuance thereof, are purely ministerial. The statement or certificate, authorized bythe act, is not a judgment, and the warrant which coerces payment, is not judicial process. They are ministerial acts, (for, otherwise , they could not be sustained ,) and the general principles of construction require, that the authority vested by the act, shall be strictly and literally pursued.

C. J. The act does not apply, in sound construction, to every commissioned officer of the army or navy of the United States, to whose hands any public money may be intrusted , but only to those regularly appointed disbursing officers, who have given official bonds, with sureties for the faithful dis-
charge of the duties of their office ; it does not embrace a mere acting purser in the navy. The construction put by the court upon this act does not affect the responsibility of a temporary acting disbursing officer of the army or navy, but simply denies his liability to the particular process authorized by the act. The responsibility of such an officer is precisely the same with that of the regularly appointed officer, who has given his official bond with surety ; and if his account has been erroneously settled, it may be opened, and any balance remaining due from him to the United States,
may be recovered in a regular course of legal proceeding. Per Curiam. In case of an erroneous settlement, a bill in equity would lie to surcharge and falsify, as in the case of a settled account between individuals. If even at law, though the settled account would be prima facie evidence, might not the true balance be recovered upon proving mistakes and omissions ? Per BARBOUR, J. Ex parte Randolph, 2 Brockenb.

(a) See note to act of Mar. 3, 1819, ch. 93, for the acts passed relating to the territory of Florida. The decisions of the Supreme Court upon the treaty between the United States and Spain of 22d of February, 1819, by which Florida was ceded to the United States, and upon the act of March 3, 1821 , have been :
By the stipulations of a treaty, are to be understood its language and apparent intentions, manifested in the instrument ; with a reference to the contracting parties, the subject matter and persons on whom it is to operate. United States v. Arredondo et al., 6 Peters, 710.
The judiciary is not that department of the government to which the assertion of its interest against foreign powers is confided ; and its duty, commonly, is to decide upon individual rights according to those principles which the political departments of the nation have established. If the course of the nation has been a plain one, its courts would hesitate to pronounce it erroneous. However individual
judges might construe the treaty of St. Ildefonso , it is the province of the Supreme Court of the United States to confine its decisions to the will of the legislature, if that will has been clearly expressed. Foster and Elamv. Neilson , 2 Peters, 307. United States v. Arredondo, 6 Peters, 710 .
A treaty of cession is a deed of the ceded territory ;the sovereign is the grantor, and the act is his ; so far as relates to the cession the treaty is his act and deed , and all courts must so consider it ; and deeds are construed in equity by the rules of law. Ibid. 738.
The Spanish version of the Florida treaty was in the words of the king, and expressed his intention ; and though the American version showed the intention of the American government to be different, the Supreme Court cannot adopt it to decide what was granted by the king of Spain, what accepted and what reserved the rules of law are too imperative to be disregarded or mistaken. The true interpretation of the Spanish language of the treaty is, that the grants of lands in Florida, made before the treaty,except those specially excepted , is that these grants remain confirmed .-The proprietors of such grants could bring suits to recover them without any action of Congress ; and any question arising would be purely a judicial question. Ibid. 741.
The object of the treaty with Spain, which ceded Florida to the United States, dated 22d May, 1819, was to invest the commissioners with full power and authority to receive , examine, and decide upon the amount and validity of asserted claims upon Spain, for damages and injuries. Their decision, within the scope of this authority, is conclusive and final , and is not re-examinable. The parties must abide by it, as the decree of a competent tribunal of exclusive jurisdiction . A rejected claim cannot be brought again under review in any judicial tribunal. But it does not naturally follow that this authority extends to adjust all conflicting rights, of different citizens, to the fund so awarded . The commissioners are to look to the original claim for damages and injuries against Spain itself; and it is wholly immaterial, who is the legal or equitable owner of the claim, provided he is an American citizen. Comegys et al . v. Vasse , 1 Peters , 212.
After the validity and amount of the claim has been ascertained by the award of the commissioners , the rights of the claimant to the fund, which has passed into his hands and those of others, are left to the ordinary course of judicial proceedings , in the established courts of justice. Ibid. 212.
The treaty with Spain recognised an existing right in the aggrieved parties to compensation ; and did not, in the most remote degree, turn upon the notion of donation or gratuity. It was demanded by our government as matter of right, and as such was granted by Spain. Ibid. 217.
Even in cases of conquest, itis very unusual for the conqueror to do more than to displace the sovereign and assume dominion over the country . The modern usage of nations, which has become law, would be violated ; that sense of justice and of right, which is acknowledged and felt by the whole civilized world , would be outraged , if private property should be generally confiscated, and private rights annulled on a change in the sovereignty of the country, by the Florida treaty. The people change their allegiance , their relation to their ancient sovereign is dissolved ; but their relations to each other and their rights of property remain undisturbed. Had Florida changed its sovereign by an act
containing no stipulation respecting the property of individuals, the right of property in all those who became subjects or citizens of the new government would have been unaffected by the change. It would have remained the same as under the ancient sovereign . United States v. Percheman , 7 Peters 51.
The language of the second article of the treaty between the United States and Spain, of 22d February, 1819, by which Florida was ceded to the United States, conforms to this general principle. Ibid.
The eighth article of the treaty must be intended to stipulate expressly for the security to private property, which the laws and usages of nations would , without express stipulation, have conferred . No
construction which would impair that security, further than its positive words require , would seem to be admissible. Without it, the titles of individuals would remain as valid under the new government as they were under the old. And those titles, so far at least as they were consummated, might be asserted in the courts of the United States, independently of this article . Ibid.
The treaty was drawn up in the Spanish as well as in the English languages. Both are original, and were unquestionably intended by the parties to be identical. The Spanish has been translated ; and it
is now understood that the article expressed in that language is, that " the grants shall remain ratified and confirmed to the persons in possession of them, to the same extent, " &c. ; thus conforming exactly to the universally received law of nations. Ibid.
If the English and Spanish part can, without violence, be made to agree, that construction which establishes this conformity ought to prevail. Ibid.
No violence is done to the language of the treaty by construction which conforms the English and Spanish to each other. Although the words " shall be ratified and confirmed," are properly words of

contract, stipulating for some future legislation, they are not necessarily so. They may import that " they shall be ratified and confirmed" by force of the instrument itself. When it is observed that in the counterpart of the same treaty, executed at the same time, by the same parties, they are used in this sense, the construction is proper, if not unavoidable. Ibid.
In the case of Foster and Elam v. Neilson , 2 Peters, 253, the Supreme Court considered those words importing a contract. The Spanish part of the treaty was not then brought into view, and it was then supposed there was no variance between them. It was not supposed that there was even a formal difference of expression in the same instrument, drawn up in the language of each party. Had this circumstance been known, it is believed it would have produced the construction which is now given to the article. Ibid.
By the law of nations, the inhabitants, citizens, or subjects of a conquered or ceded country, territory, or province, retain all the rights of property which have not been taken from them by the orders of the conqueror ; and this is the rule by which we must test its efficacy according to the act of Congress, which we must consider as of binding authority. United States v. Clarke, 9 Peters , 168.
A treaty of cession is a deed or grant by one sovereign to another, which transferred nothing to which he had no right of property ; and only such right as he owned, and could convey to the grantee. By the treaty with Spain, the United States acquired no landsin Florida to which any person had lawfully obtained such a right, by a perfect or inchoate title, that this court could consider it as property under the second article ; or which had, according to the stipulations of the eighth article of the treaty, been granted by the lawful authorities of the king ; which words, grants, or concessions, were to be construed in their broadest sense, so as to comprehend all lawful acts which operated to transfer a right of property, perfect or imperfect. Ibid.
The effect of the clauses of the confirmation of grants made was, that they confirmed them presently on the ratification of the treaty, to those in possession of the lands ; which was declared to be, that legal seisin and possession which follows title, is co-extensive with the right, and continues till it is
ousted by an actual adverse possession, as contradistinguished from residence and occupation. Ibid. The United States, by accepting the cession under the terms of the eighth article, and the ratification
by the king, with an exception of the three annulled grants to Allegon , Punon Rostro, and Vargas, can make no other exceptions of grants made by the lawful authorities of the king. Ibid.
The meaning of the words lawful authorities, in the eighth article, or competent authorities in the ratification, must be taken to be, " by those persons who exercised the granting power by the authority of the crown." The eighth article expressly recognises the existence of these lawful authorities in the
ceded territories , designating the governor or intendant, as the case might be, as invested with such authority which is to be deemed competent till the contrary is made to appear. Ibid.
By the laws of Spain" is to be understood the will of the king expressed in his orders, or by his authority, evidenced by the acts themselves ; or by such usage and customs in the province as may be presumed to have emanated from the king, or to have been sanctioned by him, as existing authorized local laws. Ibid.
In addition to the established principles heretofore laid down by this court as the legal effect of an usage or custom, there is one which is peculiarly appropriate to this case. The act of Congress giving
jurisdiction to this court to adjudicate on these causes, contains this clause in reference to grants, &c., which was protected and secured by the treaty, and which might have been perfected into a complete
title, under and in conformity to the laws, usages and customs of the government under which the same originated." This is an express recognition of any known and established usage or custom in the Spanish provinces, in relation to the grants of land, and the title thereto, which brings them within a well
established rule of law that a custom or usage, saved and preserved by a statute, has the force of an express statute, and shall control all affirmative statutes in opposition, though it must yield to the authority of negative ones, which forbid an act authorized by a custom or usage thus saved and protected ; and this is the rule by which its efficacy must be tested , according to the act of Congress, which must be considered of binding authority. Ibid.
By the eighth article of the treaty ceding Florida to the United States, the same time is allowed to the owners of land granted under the authority of Spain, to fulfil the conditions of their grants, after the date of the treaty as was limited in the grants. It has been decided by this court, in the case of
Arredondo, that as to individual rights, the treaty is to be considered as dated at its ratification. United States v. Sibbald , 10 Peters, 313.
It has been decided, in Arredondo's case, that that provision of the treaty as to the performance of the conditions in grants, is not confined to owners of land by occupancy or residence ; but extends to
persons who have a legal seisin and possession of land, in virtue of a grant ; and that, in the situation of the province, and the claimants to land at the time of the cession, it was enough that they should show a performance of the condition cy pres. Ibid.
In the construction of the Florida treaty, it is admitted that the United States succeeds to all those equitable obligations which we are to suppose would have influenced his Catholic majesty, to secure their property to his subjects, and which would have been applied by him in the construction of a conditional grant, to make it absolute ; and further, that the United States must maintain the rights of property under it, by applying the laws and customs by which those rights were secured , before Florida
was ceded ; or by which an inchoate right of property would, by those laws and customs, have been adjudicated by the Spanish authority to have become a perfect right. United States v. Mills' Heirs, 12 Peters, 215.

II. RESOLUTION providingfor jails in certain cases, for the safe custody ofpersons committed under the authority of the United States. (a)
Resolved bythe Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America, in Congress assembled, That where any state or states,

(a) The resolutions and acts of Congress relating to jails are : Resolution of September 23 , 1789, vol. i . 96. Resolution of March 3 , 1821. An act for the relief
of persons imprisoned for debt, Jan. 6, 1800 , ch. 4. Act of May 19, 1828 , ch. 68. The cases decided within the courts of the United States on the laws of " escapes" are, A discharge from the prison rules, by the insolvent law of Virginia , although obtained by fraud , is a
discharge in due course of law ; and upon such discharge, no action can be sustained upon the prison bound bond for an escape. Simms and Wise v. Slacum, 3 Cranch, 300 ; 1 Cond. Rep . 539.
The obligors in a bond for the prison limits, are not discharged from their liability for an escape, by the subsequent assent of the plaintiff. Such assent, to have any effect, must be given prior to the escape. Slocum et al. v. Hathaway, 1 Paine, 290.
The condition of a bond, that a prisoner " shall faithfully and absolutely remain within the limits of the jail, and not depart therefrom," &c. is not broken by the escape of the prisoner, while in a state of insanity. Hazard v. Hazard et al. 1 Paine , 295 .
The liability of the sureties in a prison bounds bond, for an escape, is not co- extensive with that of the sheriff: as it regards the latter, the prisoner on the limits is supposed to be in his immediate custody, and the escape of an insane prisoner, therefore, is as much a negligent escape as any other ; and he is not allowed to excuse himself, when he might so easily collude, or be imposed upon. But there is no analogy, in these respects , between a sheriff and the sureties. Ibid.
Under the act of Congress of January 6, 1800 , ch. 4, the sheriff of a county is bound to take a bond for the limits, as provided by the state laws, from a prisoner confined on process from the courts of the United States ; and false imprisonment would lie, on his refusal. Such a bond has, in all respects, the same incidents , and the like legal effect with a bond taken under the state laws. It is assignable ; and an assignment discharges the sheriff from liability for a subsequent escape. The United States v. Noah, 1 Paine , 368.
The United States are expressly named in the act, and bound by it ; and an assignment of the bond to them, when they are plaintiffs, is valid . Ibid.
The Secretary of the Treasury having accepted such an assignment, will be presumed to be authorized ; and the United States are bound by such acceptance. Ibid.
The term " process ," includes executions as well as mesne process. Ibid. After a prisoner has been enlarged upon a limit bond, the sheriff can confine him again only on the bail's becoming insufficient ; he cannot accept a surrender of him ; at all events, not after the assignment of the bond. Ibid.
If a debtor, committed to the state jail under process from the courts of the United States, escape, the marshal is not liable . Randolph v. Donaldson , 9 Cranch , 76 ; 3 Cond . Rep. 280.
The act of Congress has limited the responsibility of the marshal to his own acts, and the acts of his deputies. The keeper of a state jail is, neither in fact nor in law, the deputy of the marshal ; he is not appointed by, nor removable at the will of the marshal. When a prisoner is regularly committed
to a state jail by the marshal, he is no longer in the custody of the marshal, or controllable by him. Ibid.
Under the laws of Rhode Island , a discharge according to the act for the relief of poor prisoners for debt, although obtained by fraud and perjury, is a lawful discharge , and not an escape ; and upon such a discharge, no action can be maintained upon a bond for the liberty of the prison limits. Ammidon v. Smith et al. 1 Wheat. 447 ; 3 Cond. Rep. 619.
At common law, it is not an escape for a jailer to allow prisoners, confined for debt, the liberty of all the apartments within the jail wall ; for confinement within the walls, is salva et arcta custodia. Steere v. Field , 2 Mason's C. C. R. 486.
It is an escape, in the jailer, to make a prisoner for debt, a turnkey ; and to intrust him with the keys of the outer doors, as well as inner doors, at all times by night and by day. Ibid.
If the jailer be committed to his own jail, on execution by the sheriff, and no new keeper is appointed, it is an escape of the jailer, for which the sheriff is answerable ; but it is not an escape of the other prisoners, if they are in fact kept in custody, under the authority of the jailer or his agents. Ibid.
In Rhode Island , the doctrine as to escapes is the same as at common law ; and the statutes giving the liberty of the limits to prisoners, on giving bonds not to escape , &c. have not altered the common law. In Rhode Island, an action of debt for an escape, is a legal remedy ; that action being incorporated into the laws, by implication , by the adoption of the laws of England . Ibid.
Where the conditions of a bond for the jail limits, in Rhode Island , required the party to remain a true prisoner in the custody of the keeper of the prison , and within the limits of the prison , " until he shall be lawfully discharged , without committing any manner of escape or escapes, during the time of restraint, then this obligation to be void, or else to remain in full force and virtue :" Held, that a discharge under the insolvent laws of the state, obtained from the proper court, in pursuance of a resolution of the legislature , and discharging the party from all his debts, &c. and " from all imprisonment, arrest, and restraint of his person therefor," was a lawful discharge ; and that his going at large under it, was no breach of the condition of the bond. Mason v. Haile, 12 Wheat. 370 ; 6 Cond . Rep. 535.
After judgment obtained in the circuit court ofthe United States against the drawer of a note, a capias ad satisfaciendum was issued against him by the holder, and he was put in prison. Two justices of the peace ordered his discharge, claiming to proceed according to the law of Kentucky, in the case of insolvent debtors ; and the jailer permitted him to leave the prison. The jailer made himself and his securities liable for an escape, by permitting the prisoner to leave the prison. Bank of the United States v. Tyler, 4 Peters, 366.
The act of Congress of 1800, ch. 4, is not that by which the liberties of the jail-yard allowed to

having complied with the recommendation of Congress, in the resolution of the twenty-third day of September, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine, shall have withdrawn, or shall hereafter withdraw, either in whole or in part, the use of their jails for prisoners committed under the authority of the United States, the marshal in such state or states, under the direction of the judge of the district, shall be, and hereby is, authorized and required to hire a convenient place to serve as a tempo-

purposes, to be paid out of the treasury of the United States. APPROVED, March 3, 1821 .

debtors imprisoned on execution issuing from the courts of the United States, are now regulated. The United States v. Knight et al . , 3 Sumners' C. C. R. 358.
The act of 1828, ch. 68, has adopted the state laws on the subject of jail liberties then existing in the states, under the words " that writs of execution and other final process issued on judgment and decrees rendered in any of the courts of the United States and the proceedings thereon shall be the
same, &c., as are now used in such states," &c. Ibid. Action on a bond given to the United States for liberty of the jail-yard, in Portland, in the state of
Maine. The condition of the bond was that J. K. and B. K. should continue true prisoners , in the
custody of the jailer, within the limits of the jail-yard. It was agreed by the counsel of the plaintiff and defendant that J. K. and B. K. had remained within the limits of the jail-yard " as established under the laws of Massachusetts of 1787, then prevailing in Maine, the limits of the jail-yard having ,
in October, 1798 , been extended over the whole county ; but had not remained within the limits established on the 28th of May, 1787, and existing when the act of Congress was passed , 4th January, 1800 ,
authorizing persons under process from the United States, to have "the jail limits, " as established by the laws of the states. Held, that the act of Congress of May 19, 1828, gives the debtor imprisoned
under execution fromthe courts ofthe United States, at the suit of the United States, the privilege of
the jail limits, in the several states, as they were fixed by laws of the several states at the date of that act. The United States v. Knight et al. 14 Peters , 301.
Whatever might be the liability of the officer who took the bond from the defendants, if the jail limits continued to be such as were established under the law of Massachusetts of 1787, the bond not having been taken under that law, and the condition being different from the requirements of those regulations,
the parties to the bond, the suit being upon the bond , are bound for nothing whatever, but what is contained in the condition , whether it be or be not conformable to the law. Ibid.
The statute of May 19, 1828 , entitled " An act to regulate process in the courts of the United
States," which proposes only to regulate the mode of proceeding in civil cases, does not divest the public of any right, does not violate any principle of public policy, but onthe contrary makes a provision with the policy which the government has vindicated by many acts of previous legislation, to conform to the laws of the state, in giving to persons imprisoned under execution the privilege of jail limits, embracing executions at the suit of the United States. Ibid.
Action for an escape against the sheriff of Madison , Mississippi, he having received into his custody as a prisoner, the defendant in an action in the circuit court of Mississippi, taken under execution, and having permitted and suffered him to escape. The declaration set out the judgment obtained by the plaintiffs against Scott, the defendant in the circuit court, the execution, the arrest of Scott, and his delivery to Long, the sheriff, who received him into his custody under the execution, and detained him, until , without leave or license of the plaintiffs in the execution, and against their will, he permitted him to escape and go at large , &c . , &c. To this declaration the defendant pleaded that he does not owe the sum of money demanded in the declaration " in the manner and form as complained against him," and the jury found that the defendant Long " doth owe the debt in the declaration mentioned as therein alleged ," and assessed damages for the detention thereof, at one thousand and sixteen dollars and ninety- six cents, upon which the court gave judgment for six thousand three hundred and fifty-six dollars, and one thousand and sixteen dollars and ninety-six cents damages. Held, that the judgment of the circuit court is correct under the provisions of the statute of Mississippi of 7th June, 1822. The jury were not required in the action to find specially that the prisoner escaped with the consent, and through the negligence ofthe sheriff. The plea alleged that the defendant did not owe the sum of money demanded, " inthe manner and form as the plaintiff complained against him." This plea put in issue everymaterial averment in the declaration ; on this issue, on the most strict and rigid construction, the jury have expressly found all that is required to be found by the requirements of the act. Long v. Palmer et al. 16 Peters, 65.
If the sheriff suffers or permits a prisoner to escape, this, both in common parlance, and legal intend-
ment, is an escape with the consent of the sheriff. Ibid. The object of the act is to make the sheriff liable for a voluntary or negligent escape ; and that this
shall be found by the jury ; and if this appear from the record by express finding, or by the necessary con-
clusion of law, it is sufficient. Ibid.

If a suit should come before the Supreme Court of the United States, which involved the construc-

tion of any of the laws imposing duties on the heads of the executive departments, the court would

not certainly be bound to adopt the construction given by the head of a department ; and if they sup-

posed the decision to be wrong, they would , of course, so pronounce their judgment. But the judg-

ment of the court upon the construction of a law, must be given in a case in which they have jurisdic-

tion, and in which it is their duty to interpret the act of Congress, in order to ascertain the rights ofthe

parties in the cause before them. The court could not entertain an appeal from the decision of one of the secretaries , nor revise his judgment in any case where the law authorized him to exercise his dis-

cretion or judgment. Nor can it, by mandamus, act directly upon the officer, or guide and control his

judgment or discretion in the matters committed to his care, in the ordinary discharge of his official

duties. The interference of the court with the performance of the ordinary duties of the executive de-

partments of the government, would be productive of nothing but mischief; and this power was never intended to be given to them. Ibid.

The defendant was collector of the port of Gloucester, and was removed from office July 29, 1829. From January first in the same year, to the day of his removal, he received for salary, fees and commissions, $3457 83 ; the excess of this over $3000, after deducting certain legal expenses , he paid into the treasury of the United States. Held, that all the fees and commissions received by the collector are to be deemed to be received for his own use, until they exceed the maximum amount of $ 3000 ; that the defendant was therefore absolutely entitled, in his own right to the fees and emoluments of office, not exceeding $ 3000 , rece ed during the seven months preceding his removal, although he did not continue in office a whole year from January first ; and that the year of his successor in office commenced on the day of his appointment, and ended with the same day in the succeeding year.

After the acquisition of Florida by the United States, in virtue of the treaty with Spain, of 22d of February, 1819, various acts of Congress were passed for the adjustment of private land claims , within the ceded territory. The tribunals authorized to decide on them, were not authorized to settle any which exceeded a league square ; on those exceeding that quantity, they were directed to report, especially, their opinion , for the future action of Congress. The lands embraced in the larger claims were defined by surveys , and plats retained ; these were reserved from sale, and remained unsettled until some resolution should be adopted for a final adjudication of them, which was done by the passage of the law of the 22d of May, 1828. By the sixth section it was provided , " that all claims to land within the territory of Florida, embraced by the treaty, which shall not be finally decided and settled under the provisions of the same law, containing a greater quantity of land than the commissioners were authorized to decide, and above the amount confirmed by the act, and which have not been reported as antedated, or forged, shall be received and adjudicated by the judges of the superior court of the district in which the land lies, upon the petition of the claimant, according to the forms, rules and regulations , conditions, restrictions and regulations prescribed to the district judge, and to the claimants, by the act of 26th May, 1824.

Arredondo and Son, for land at Alachua, in Florida, gave a valid title to these claimants under the grant, according to the stipulations under the treaty between the United States and Spain, of 1819. Bythe laws of nations, of the United States, and of Spain, a concession or condition becomes absolute, where the condition is performed. Ibid. 691 .
The original concession by governor Coppinger, on the petition of George J. F. Clarke, was made on the 17th of December, 1817, of twenty-six thousand acres of land, in the places he solicited in his petition, and a complete title was made of twenty-two thousand acres, part of the same, in December, 1817. Twenty thousand acres, part of the whole concession, were sold by the appellee. The other four thousand were surveyed in conformity with the decree of 17th December, 1817, and a complete title to the same was made by governor Coppinger, on the 4th of May, 1818. By the court- The claimant cannot avail himself of the grant of the 4th of May, 1818 , made after the 24th of January, 1818 , the time limited by the Florida treaty. He must rest his claim on the concession made on the 17th of December, 1817, United States v. Clarke , 8 Peters, 436.
The validity of concessions of land, by the authorities of Spain, in East Florida, is expressly recognised in the Florida treaty, and in the several acts of Congress. Ibid.
The eighth article allows the owners of land the same time for fulfilling the conditions of their grants from the date of the treaty, as is allowed in the grant from the date of the instrument. And the act of
the 8th of May, 1822, requires every person claiming title to lands under any patent, grant, concession, or order of survey dated previous to the 24th of January, 1818, to file his claim before the commissioners, appointed in pursuance of that act. All the subsequent acts on the subject, observe the same language ; and the titles under these concessions have been uniformly confirmed, when the tract did not exceed a league square. Ibid.
A claim to lands in East Florida, the title to which was derived from grants by the Creek and Seminole Indians, ratified by the local authorities of Spain, before the cession of Florida by Spain to the United States, confirmed . Mitchel et al. v. The United States, 9 Peters, 711.
It was objected to the title claimed in this case, which had been presented to the superior court of Middle Florida, under the provisions of the acts of Congress for the settlement of land claims in Florida, that the grantees did not acquire, under the Indian grants , a legal title to the land. Held : that the acts of Congress submit these claims to the adjudication of this court as a court of equity ; and those acts, as often and uniformly construed in its repeated decisions, confer the same jurisdiction over imperfect, inchoate and inceptive titles, as legal and perfect ones ; and require the court to decide by the same rules on all claims submitted to it, whether legal or equitable. Ibid.
In the case of the United States v. Arredondo , 6 Peters, 691 , the lands granted had been in the possession and occupation of the Alachua Indians, and the centre of the tract was an Indian town of that name. But the land had been abandoned , and before any grant was made by the intendant, a report was made by the attorney and surveyor general on a reference to them, finding the fact of abandonment; on which it was decreed that the lands had reverted to, and become annexed to the royal domain . Ibid.
By the common law, the king has no right of entry on lands which is not commonto his subjects ; the king is put to his inquest of office, or information of intrusion, in all cases where a subject is put to his action ; their right is the same, though the king has more convenient remedies in enforcing his. Ifthe king has no original right of possession to lands , he cannot acquire it without office found, so as to annex it to his domain. Ibid.
The United States have acted on the same principle in the various laws which Congress have passed in relation to private claims to lands in the Floridas ; they have not undertaken to decide for themselves, on the validity of such claims, without the previous action of some tribunal, special or judicial . They have not authorized an entry to be made on the possession of any person in possession, by colour of a Spanish grant or title ; nor the sale of any lands as part of the national domain ; with any intention to impair private rights. The laws which give jurisdiction to the district courts ofthe territories to decide in the first instance, and to this court on appeal, prescribe the mode by which lands which have been possessed or claimed to have been granted pursuant to the laws of Spain, shall become a part of the national
domain ; which, as declared in the seventh section of the act of 1824, is a " final decision against any claimant pursuant to any of the provisions of the law. " Ibid.

ascertaining claims and titles to lands in Florida.

ascertaining the claims and titles to lands within the territory of Florida, as acquired by the treaty of the twenty-second of February, one thousand eight hundred and nineteen, there shall be appointed, by the President of the United States, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate,

One uniform rule seems to have prevailed in the British provinces in America, by which Indian lands were held and sold, from their first settlement, as appears by their laws ; that friendly Indians were protected in the possession of the lands they occupied, and were considered as owning them by a perpetual right of possession in the tribe or nation inhabiting them as their common property, from generation to generation, not as the right of the individuals located on particular spots. Subject to this right of possession, the ultimate fee was in the crown and its grantees ; which could be granted by the crown or colonial legislatures while the lands remained in possession of the Indians ; though possession could not be taken without their consent. Ibid.
Individuals could not purchase Indian lands without permission or license from the crown, colonial governors, or according to the rules prescribed by colonial laws ; but such purchases were valid with such license, or in conformity with the local laws ; and by this union of the perpetual right of occupancy with the ultimate fee, which passed from the crown by the license, the title of the purchaser became complete. Ibid.
Indian possession or occupation was considered with reference to their habits and modes of life ; their hunting grounds were as much in their actual possession as the cleared fields of the whites ; and their rights to its exclusive enjoyment in their own way, and for their own purposes, were as much respected until they abandoned them, made a cession to the government, or an authorized sale to individuals. In either case their rights became extinct, the lands could be granted disencumbered of the right of occupancy, or enjoyed in full dominion by the purchases from the Indians. Such was the tenure of Indian
lands by the laws of Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island , New York , New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia , North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. Ibid.
Grants made by the Indians at public councils , since the treaty at Fort Stanwick's, have been made directly to the purchasers, or to the state in which the land lies, in trust for them, or with directions to convey to them ; of which there are many instances of large tracts so sold and held ; especially in New York. Ibid.
It was the universal rule that purchases made at Indian treaties, in the presence, and with the approbation of the officer under whose direction they were held by the authority of the crown, gave a valid
title to the lands ; it prevailed under the laws of the states after the revolution ; and yet continues in those where the right to the ultimate fee is owned by the states, or their grantees. It has been adopted by the United States : and purchases made at treaties held by their authority, have been always held good by the ratification of the treaty, without any patent to the purchasers from the United States. This rule in the colonies was founded on a settled rule of the law of England , that by his prerogative the king was the universal occupant of all vacant lands in his dominions, and had the right to grant them at his pleasure, or by his authorized officers. Ibid.
When the United States acquired and took possession of the Floridas, the treaties which had been made with the Indian tribes before the acquisition of the territory by Spain and Great Britain, remained in force over all the ceded territory as the laws which regulated the relations with all the Indians who were parties to them ; and were binding on the United States, by the obligation they had assumed by the Louisiana treaty, as a supreme law of the land, which was inviolable by the power of Congress. They were also binding as the fundamental law of Indian rights , acknowledged by royal orders, and municipal regulations ofthe provinces, as the laws and ordinances of Spain in the ceded provinces, which were declared to continue in force by the proclamation of the governor in taking possession of the province ; and by the acts of Congress which assured all the inhabitants of protection in their property. It would be an unwarranted construction of these treaties, laws , ordinances and municipal regulations , to decide that the Indians were not to be maintained in the enjoyment of all the rights which they could have enjoyed under either, had the province remained under the dominion of Spain. It would be rather a perversion of their spirit, meaning and terms, contrary to the injunction of the law under which the court acts, which makes the stipulations of any treaty, the laws and ordinances of Spain ; and these acts of Congress, so far as either apply to this case , the standard rules for its decision. Ibid.
The treaties with Spain and England before the acquisition of Florida by the United States, which guarantied to the Seminole Indians their lands according to the right of property with which they possessed them , were adopted by the United States ; who thus became the protectors of all the rights they had previously enjoyed, or could of right enjoy under Great Britain or Spain, as individuals or nations, by any treaty, to which the United States thus became parties in 1803. Ibid.
The Indian right to the lands as property was not merely of possession, that of alienation was concomitant ; both were equally secured, protected , and guarantied by Great Britain and Spain , subject only to ratification and confirmation by the license, charter or deed from the governor representing the king. Such purchases enabled the Indians to pay their debts, compensate for their depredations on the traders resident among them, to provide for their wants ; while they were available to the purchasers as payment of the considerations which at their expense had been received by the Indians. It would have been a violation of the faith of the government to both, to encourage traders to settle in the province , to put themselves and property in the power of the Indians, to suffer the latter to contract debts, and when willing to pay them by the only means in their power, a cession of their lands, withhold an assent to the purchase, which by their laws or municipal regulations was necessary to vest a title. Such a course was never adopted by Great Britain in any of her colonies ; nor by Spain in Louisiana or Florida. Ibid.
The laws made it necessary , when the Indians sold their lands , to have the deeds presented to the governor for confirmation. The sales by the Indians transferred the kind of right which they possessed ; the ratification of the sale by the governor must be regarded as a relinquishment of the title of the crown to the purchaser ; and no instance is known where permission to sell has been " refused, or of the rejection of an Indian sale." Ibid.
In the present case the Indian sale has been confirmed with more than usual solemnity and publicity; it has been done at a public council and convention of the Indians conformably to treaties, to which the

king was a party, and which the United States adopted ; and the grant was known to both parties to the treaty of cession. The United States were not deceived by the purchase, which they knew was subject to the claim of the petitioner, or those from whom he purchased ; and they made no stipulation which should put it to a severer test than any other ; and it was made to a house which, in consideration of its great and continued services to the king and his predecessor, had deservedly given them high claims as well on his justice as his faith. But if there could be a doubt that the evidence in the record did not establish the fact of a royal license or assent to this purchase, as a matter of specific and judicial belief, it would be presumed as a matter of law arising from the facts and circumstances of the case, which are admitted or unquestioned . Ibid.
As decided by the Supreme Court, the law presumes the existence in the provinces of an officer authorized to make valid grants ; a fortiori, to give license to purchase and to confirm ; and the treaty designates the governor of West Florida as the proper officer to make grants of Indian lands by confirmation ; as plainly as it does the governor of East Florida to make original grants, or the intendant of West Florida to grant royal lands. A direct grant from the crown, of lands in a royal haven may be
presumed on an uninterrupted possession of sixty years ; on a prescriptive possession of crown lands for forty years. Ibid.
The length of time which brings a given case within the legal presumption of a grant, charter or license, to validate a right long enjoyed, is not definite , depending on its peculiar circumstances. Ibid.
Juan Percheman claimed two thousand acres of land lying in the territory of Florida, by virtue of a grant from the Spanish governor, made in 1815. His title consisted of a petition presented by himself to the governor of East Florida, praying for a grant of two thousand acres, at a designated place, in pursuance of the royal order of the 29th of March, 1815, granting lands to the military who were in St. Augustine during the invasion of 1812 and 1813 ; a decree by the governor, made 12th December, 1815, in conformity to the petition, in absolute property, under the authority of the royal order, a certified copy of which decree and of the petition was directed to be issued to him from the secretary's office , in order that it may be to him in all events an equivalent of a title in form ; a petition to the governor, dated 31st December, 1815, for an order of survey, and a certificate of a survey having been made on the 20th of August, 1819 , in obedience to the same. This claim was presented, according to law, to the register and receiver of East Florida, while acting as a board of commissioners to ascertain claims and titles to lands in East Florida. The claim was rejected by the board, and the following entry made of the same. " In the memorial of the claimant to this board, he speaks of a survey made by authority
in 1829. If this had been produced , it would have furnished some support for the certificate of Aguilar. As it is, we reject the claim." Held, that this was not a final action on the claim, in the sense those words are used in the act of the 26th of May, 1830, entitled " An act supplementary to," &c. United States v. Percheman, 7 Peters , 51.
A grant of land in Florida within the Indian boundary, by the governor, acting under the crown of Spain before the cession of Florida to the United States, was confirmed to the grantee, by the decree of the judge of the eastern district of Florida. The decree was affirmed on appeal. The United States v. Fernandez, 10 Peters, 303.
The subject of grants of land within the Indian boundary, which had not by any official act been declared a part of the royal domain, was fully and ably considered in the case of Johnson v. M'Intosh, 8 Wheat. 543 ; 5 Cond. Rep. 515. Every European government claimed and exercised the right of granting lands, while in the occupation of the Indians. Ibid.
The grants of lands in the possession of the Indians by the governor of Florida, under the crown of Spain, were good to pass the right of the crown. The grants severed them from the royal domain, so that they became private property ; which was not ceded to the United States by the treaty with Spain. Ibid.
The Supreme Court cannot attach any condition to a grant of absolute property in the whole of the land. This grant was made by the governor of East Florida in absolute property, with a promise of a title in form. He was the exclusive judge of the conditions to be imposed on his grant, and of their performance. The United States v. Segui, 10 Peters, 306.
A grant of land by the governor of East Florida, in consideration of services to the Spanish government, made before the cession of the territory of Florida to the United States, confirmed. The United States v. Chaires, 10 Peters, 308.
Under a grant of the governor of Florida, prior to the cession of the same to the United States, of sixteen thousand acres of land, for the purpose of erecting a water-mill , a survey of five hundred and twenty acres was made ; and at another place, a survey of fifteen thousand six hundred and thirty acres was also made. The Supreme Court held, that the first survey of five hundred and twenty acres was valid, and that the survey of fifteen thousand four hundred and eighty acres was invalid ; but that the grantee has a title to fifteen thousand four hundred and eighty acres of vacant land ; which he has a right to have surveyed, adjoining the survey of five hundred and twenty acres. The United States v. Seton, 10 Peters, 309.
Under a Spanish grant of five miles square, ten thousand acres were surveyed at one place , and six thousand acres were surveyed at another place , as the whole quantity of ungranted land could not be found together. The grant was confirmed. The United States v. Sibbald, 10 Peters, 313.
A grant of land was made by governor Coppinger, in June, 1828. The grant was made to the appellee, on his stating his intention to build a saw-mill. The decree grants to the petitioner " license to construct a water-saw mill , on the creek known by the name of Pottsburg, bounded by the lands of Strawberry Hill, and this tract not being sufficient, I grant him the equivalent quantity in Cedar Swamp about a mile east of M'Queen's mill , but with the precise condition that, as long as he does not erect said machinery, this grant will be considered null , and without value nor effect until that event taken

By the Court-The judge of the superior court construed this concession to be a grant of land, and we concur with him. United States v. Richard, 8 Peters, 470.
A grant of land in East Florida was made by the governor, before the cession of Florida by Spain to the United States, on conditions which were not performed by the grantee within the time limited in the grant; or any exertions made by him to perform them. No sufficient cause for the non-performance of the conditions having been shown, the decree of the Supreme Court of East Florida, which confirmed the grant, was reversed. United States v. Mills' Heirs, 12 Peters, 215.
A grant for land in Florida by governor Coppinger, on condition that the grantee build a mill, within a period fixed in the grant, was declared to be void ; the grantee not having performed the condition, or shown sufficient cause for its non-performance. United States v. Kingsley, 12 Peters, 476.
Under the Florida treaty, grants of land made before the 24th January, 1818, by his Catholic majesty, or by his lawful authorities, stand ratified and confirmed to the same extent that the same grants would be valid if Florida had remained under the dominion of Spain ; and the owners of conditional grants who have been prevented from fulfilling all the conditions of their grants, have time by the treaty extended to them to complete such conditions. That time as was declared by the Supreme Court in Arredondo's case, 6 Peters, 691 , began to run in regard to individual rights, from the ratification of the treaty ; and the treaty declares, if the conditions are not complied with, within the terms limited in the grant, that the grants shall be null and void. Ibid.
A grant by governor Coppinger of fourteen thousand five hundred acres of land, in East Florida, part of thirty thousand acres granted in consideration of services to the crown of Spain, and the officers of Spain, which had been surveyed by the appointed officer, confirmed. Levy v. Arredondo, 12 Peters , 218.
The court refused to allow a survey of land to be made to make up for a deficiency in the survey of fourteen thousand five hundred acres, in consequence of part of the land included therein being covered with water, and being marshes. Even if a survey had not been made under the concession, it would not be competent for the superior court of East Florida, or for the Supreme Court, to designate a new location varying from the original concession, as any such variation would be equivalent to a new grant. Ibid.
A concession was made by the governor of Florida, before the cession of Florida to the United States, on condition that the grantee should erect a water saw-mill, " and with the precise condition, that until he executes the said machinery, the grant to be considered void, and without effect, until that event takes place." The mill was never erected , and no sufficient reason shown for its non-erection. The court held that the concession gave no title to the land. United States v. Drummond, 13 Peters, 84.
A grant of land in East Florida, by the Spanish governor, on the condition that a water saw-mill should be erected on the land , declared void ; the condition of the grant not having been performed according to the terms of the grant. United States v. Burgevin , 13 Peters, 85.
A grant by governor Coppinger of fourteen thousand five hundred acres of land, in East Florida, part of the thirty thousand acres, granted in consideration of services to the crown of Spain and the officers of Spain, which had been surveyed by the appointed officer, confirmed. The United States v. Moses E. Levy, 13 Peters, 81.
The court refused to allow a survey of land to be made, to make up for a deficiency in the survey of fourteen thousand five hundred acres, in consequence of part of the land included therein being covered with water, and being marshes. Even if a survey had not been made under the concession, it would not be competent for the superior court of East Florida, or for the Supreme Court, to desig nate a new location varying from the original concession, as any such variation would be equivalent to a new grant. Ibid.
A grant of land by Estrada, the governor of East Florida, was made on the 1st of August, 1815, to Elizabeth Wiggins, on a petition, stating, that " owing to the diminution of trade, she will have to devote herself to the pursuits of the country." The grant was made for the quantity of land appor tioned by the regulations of East Florida to the number of the family of the grantee. It was regularly surveyed by the surveyor general , according to the petition and grant. No settlement or improve ment was ever made by the grantee, or by any one acting for her, on the property. In 1831 , Elizabeth Wiggins presented a petition to the superior court of East Florida, praying for a confirmation ofthe grant; and in July, 1838, the court gave a decree in favour of the claimant. On an appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, the decree of the superior court of East Florida was reversed. The court held, that by the regulations established on the 25th November, 1818, by governor Coppinger, the grant had become void, because of the non-improvement, and the neglect to settle the land granted. The United States v. Elizabeth Wiggins, 14 Peters, 334.
The existence of a foreign law, especially unwritten, is a fact to be proved like any other fact, by appropriate evidence. Ibid.
A copy of the decree by the governor of East Florida, granting land to a petitioner while Spain had possession of the territory, certified by the secretary of the government to have been faithfully made from the original in the secretary's office, is evidence in the courts of the United States. By the laws of Spain, prevailing in the province at that time, the secretary was the proper officer to give copies ; and the law trusted him for this particular purpose, so far as he acted under its authority. The original was confined to the public office. Ibid.

The eighth article of the Florida treaty stipulates, that " grants of land made by Spain, in Florida, after the 24th of January, 1818, shall be ratified and confirmed to the persons in possession of the land,

to the same extent that the same grants would be valid, if the government of the territory had remained

under the dominion of Spain." The government of the United States may take advantage of the non-

performance of the conditions prescribed by the law relative to grants of land, if the treaty does not provide for the omission. Ibid.

In the cases of Arredondo , 6 Peters, 691 , and Percheman , 7 Peters, 54, it was held, that the words in

the Florida treaty, " shall be ratified and confirmed ;" in reference to perfect titles, should be construed, " are ratified and confirmed." The object of the court in these cases was to exempt them from the

operation of the eighth article, for that they were perfect titles by the laws of Spain, when the treaty was made ; and that when the soil and sovereignty of Florida were ceded by the second article, private rights of property were, by implication, protected . By the law of nations, the rights to property are secured when territories are ceded ; and to reconcile the eighth article of the treaty with the law of nations, the Spanish side of the article was referred to in aid of the American side. The court held, that perfect titles " stood confirmed" by the treaty ; and must be so recognised by the United States, in our courts. Ibid.

Perfect titles to lands, made by Spain in the territory of Florida before the 24th January , 1818 , were

intrinsically valid, and exempt from the provision of the eighth article of the treaty ; and they need no sanction from the legislative or judicial departments of the United States. Ibid.

The eighth article of the Florida treaty was intended to apply to claims to land whose validity depended on the performance of conditions, in consideration of which the concessions had been made ; and which must have been performed before Spain was bound to perfect the titles. The United States were bound after the cession of the country, to the same extent that Spain had been bound before the ratification of the treaty, to perfect them by legislation and adjudication. Ibid.
A grant of land by the government of Florida , made before the cession of Florida to the United

States by Spain , confirmed : every point involved in the case having been conclusively settled by the court in their former adjudications in similar cases. The United States v. Waterman , 14 Peters, 478.

The Supreme Court, in the case of the United States v. Clark, 8 Peters, 48, say " that if the validity of the grant depends upon its being in conformity with the royal order of Spain of 1790, it cannot be supported ;" but immediately proceeds to show, " though the royal order is recited in the grant, that it was, in fact, founded on the meritorious consideration of the petitioner having constructed a machine of great value for sawing timber ; the recital of the royal order of 1790, in this grant, is entirely im-

material , and does not affect the instrument." Held, the recital of the royal order, in this case, is quite immaterial. The United States v. Rodman , 15 Peters, 130.

The case of the United States v. Wiggins, 14 Peters , 325, which decided that certain proof of the

certificate of Aguilar, secretary of East Florida, was sufficient, cited ; and the decision on that point affirmed. Ibid.

The Spanish governors of Florida had, by the laws of the Indies, power to make large grants to the subjects of the crown of Spain. The royal order of Spain of 1790, applied to grants to foreigners. These grants, before the cession of Florida to the United States, had been sanctioned for many years by the king of Spain, and the authorities representing him in Cuba , the Floridas, and Louisiana . This authority has been frequently affirmed by the Supreme Court. Ibid.

An application was made to the governor of Florida, in 1814, stating services performed by the petitioner forthe government of Spain, and the intention of the petitioner to invest his means in the erection of a water saw-mill, and marking the place where the lands were situated which were asked for.

The governor granted the land, referring to the merits and services of the applicant, and in consideration of the advantages which would result to the home and foreign trade by the use proposed to be made of the land. Held , that this was not a conditional grant ; and that no evidence of the erection of a water saw-mill was required to be given to maintain its validity, or induce its confirmation . Ibid.
John Forbes by memorial to governor Kindelan , the governor of East Florida , set forth, that in 1799,

there had been granted to Panton Leslie and company, for the purpose of pasturage, fifteen thousand acres of land, which they were obliged to abandon , as being of inferior quality. Forbes, as the successor to these grantees , asked to be permitted to abandon these fifteen thousand acres, and in lieu, to have granted to him ten thousand acres, as an equivalent, on Nassau river. The petition avers that the object was to establish a rice plantation. The petition was referred to the " Comptroller," who gave it as his opinion that the culture of rice should be promoted. Governor Kindelan permitted the abandonment of the fifteen thousand acres granted before, and in lieu thereof, granted to John Forbes, for the purpose of cultivating rice, ten thousand acres in the district, on banks of the river Nassau. Sur-

veys of seven thousand acres of land , at the head of the river " Little St. Mary" or " St. Mary," and three thousand acres in " Cabbage Swamp," were made under this grant. No description of the

locality of the land other than that in the certificate of the survey was given ; nor do the surveys prove that the land surveyed lay in the district of the river Nassau . No evidence was given of the situation of Cabbage Swamp." Held, that these surveys were not made of the land granted by governor Kindelan ; and according to the decisions of this court on all occasions, the surveys, to give them validity, must be in conformity with the grants on which they are founded ; and to make them the origin oftitle, they must be of the land described in the grant of the Spanish government. The United States v. Forbes, 15 Peters , 173.

The courts of justice can only adjudge what had been granted ; and declare that the lands granted by the lawful authorities of Spain, are separated from the public domain : but where the land is ex-

pressly granted at one place, they have no power, by a decree, to grant an equivalent at another place,

The courts of the United States have no authority to divest the title of the United States in the public lands, and vest it in claimants ; however just the claim may be to an equal value for land , the previous grant of which has failed. Ibid.
The decree of the superior court of East Florida, by which a grant for fifty thousand acres of land, made by governor White, the Spanish governor of East Florida, dated July 29, 1802, was rejected, affirmed. Buyck v. The United States, 15 Peters , 215.
The land had been granted by governor White , on a petition from the grantee stating his intention to occupy and improve the same with Bengal negroes, and native citizens of the United States ; and stating that other grants of the same lands had been made , on condition of settlement, which conditions
had not been performed, and such grants were therefore void. The petitioner promised to make the settlement within an early period after the grant. The governor granted the land , referring to the petition, also , with the condition that the grantee should not cede any part of the land, without the con-
sent ofthe government. No endorsement or settlement was at any time made on the land by the grantee.
Held , that the government of the United States were not bound under the Florida treaty, to confirm the grant. Ibid.
The description of the portion of the land asked for from the Spanish governor, " lands at Musquitoto fifty thousand acres, south and north of said place ," is not sufficiently definite : and from such a description no exception could be made from the public lands acquired by the United States under the Florida
treaty. The regulations for granting lands in Florida by the Spanish authorities, required that grants should be made in a certain place : and there were no floating rights of survey out of the place designated in the grant ; unless when the land granted could not be got there in its exact quantity, and an equivalent was provided for. Ibid.
The laws and ordinances of the government of Spain in relation to grants of land by the Spanish government, must be of universal application in the construction of grants. It is essential to the vali-
dity of such grants, that the land granted shall be described so as to be capable of being distinguished from other things of the same kind , or capable of being ascertained by extraneous testimony. Ibid.
The certificate of Don Tomas de Aguilar , secretary of the government and province, of the copy of the grant of the governor, stating the same " to be faithfully drawn from the original in the secretary's office under his charge ," was legal evidence of the grant ; and was properly admitted as such in support of the same. The United States v. Delespine , 15 Peters, 226.
A grant of ten thousand two hundred and forty acres of land by the Spanish governor of Florida, which recited among other things, that it was made under a royal order of the king of Spain, of 29th March, 1815, and which was not in conformity with the grant, but which was made in the exercise of other powers to grant lands which had been vested in the governor, was not made invalid by the recital of the royal order as the authority for the grant. The grant recited also , that it was made in consideration of military services, and was also in consideration of the surrender of another grant previously made, which surrender had been accepted by the governor. These were sufficient inducements to the grant. lbid.
A claim for land in East Florida, granted by governor White to Daniel O'Hara, rejected by the superior court of East Florida, and the decree of that court affirmed . O'Hara v. The United States , 15 Peters, 275.
Governor White, on the petition of Daniel O'Hara, soliciting a grant offifteen thousand acres, made a decree granting " the lands solicited," " at the place indicated ," " in conformity with the number of workers which he may have to cultivate them, the corresponding number of acres may be surveyed to him," " and that he will take possession of the said lands in six months from the date of said grant." Held, that thisis a decree not granting fifteen thousand acres as asked for ; but so much of the place where it is asked for as shall be surveyed in conformity with the number of workers the grantee may have to cultivate the land ; the quantity could be determined by the regulation of the governor, made the month after the grant, and determining the quantity of land to be surveyed according to the number of persons in the family of the grantee , slaves included. That the grant was made before the date of the regulation, makes no difference. Ibid.
No settlement was made on the lands claimed under the grant. The building of a house on the land is but evidence of an intention to make a settlement, but was not a settlement ; which required the removal of persons or workers to the land , and cultivating it. Ibid.
No claim for the land can be sustained under a grant, or confirmation of a prior grant, made by a decree of governor Coppinger in 1819, as the same was substantially a violation of the treaty with Spain, which confirms only grants made before the 24th January, 1818. The prior grant to O'Hara having become void by the non-performance of the conditions annexed to it, the decree of governor Coppinger, in 1819, was an attempt to make a new grant. Ibid.
If the grant were not void from the non-performance of the conditions of settlement annexed to it, the omission to have the land surveyed , and returned to the proper office, would make it void, unless the grantee had made a settlement ; in which event, a survey would be presumed. The grant was made in the " district of Nassau," &c. This was an indefinite description of the land, as was held in Buyck v. The United States, decided at this term. Ibid.
A concession of lands, by the council at St. Augustine, was not authorized by the laws of Spain, relative to the granting and confirming land titles. The United States v. Delespine, 15 Peters, 319.
When a grant of land is indefinite as to its location , or so uncertain as to the place where the lands granted are intended to be surveyed , as to make it impossible to make a survey under the terms of the grant with certainty, the grant will not be confirmed. Ibid.
The act of Congress of 26th May, 1830 , requires that all claims to lands which have been presented to

SEVENTEENTH CONGRESS. SESS. I. CH. 129. 1822.

and translate all papers that may be required of him by the commissioners."
SEC. 3. And be it further enacted, That said commissioners, pre-
viously to entering on a discharge of the duties assigned them, shall,
the commissioners, or to the register and receiver of East Florida, and had not been " finally acted upon," should be adjudicated and settled , as prescribed by the act of 1828. There was no direct limi-
tation as to the time in which a claim should be presented. Ibid. When a petition for the confirmation of a claim to lands in Florida was presented, and was defective,
and the court allowed an amended petition to be filed, it would be too strict to say the original petition
was not the commencement of the proceeding, but that the amendment allowed by the superior court should be taken as the date when the claim was first preferred . Ibid.
When certain testimonials of title under a Spanish grant had been admitted , without exception , before the commissioners of the United States for the adjustment of claims to lands in Florida , and before the superior court in Middle Florida , without objection as to the mode and form of their proof; the Supreme Court, on an appeal, will not interfere with the question as to the sufficiency of the proof, or the authenticity of the act, relating to the title which had been admitted by the authorities in Florida, which was the tribunal to judge of the evidence. Ibid.
Breward petitioned the governor of East Florida, intending to establish a saw-mill to saw timber in St. John's river, for a grant of five miles square of land, or its equivalent ; ten thousand acres to be in the neighbourhood of the place designated, and the remaining six thousand acres in Cedar Swamp , on the west side of St. John's river, and in Cabbage Hammock on the east side of the river. The governor granted the land asked for, on the condition that the mill should be built ; and the condition was complied with. On the 27th of May, 1817 , the surveyor general surveyed seven thousand acres under the grant, including Little Cedar Creek, and bounded on three sides by Big Cedar Creek , including the mill. This grant and survey were confirmed . The United States v. Breward, 16 Peters , 143.
Three thousand acres were laid off on the northern part of the river St. John's, and east of the royal road, leading from the river to St. Mary's, four or five miles from the first survey. This survey having been made at a place not within the grant, was void but the court held that the grantee is to be allowed to survey under the grant, three thousand acres adjoining the survey of seven thousand acres, if so much vacant land can be found ; and patents for the same shall issue for the land , if laid out in conformity with the decree of the court in this case. Ibid.
In 1819, two thousand acres were surveyed in Cedar Swamp, west of the river St. John's, at a place known by the name of Sugartown . This survey was confirmed. Ibid.
Four thousand acres, by survey, dated April , 1819 , in Cabbage Hammock, were laid out by the surveyor general. This survey was confirmed. Ibid.
By the eighth article of the Florida treaty, all grants of lands made before the 24th ofJanuary, 1824, by his Catholic majesty, were confirmed ; but all grants made since the time when the first proposal by his majesty for the cession of the country was made , are declared and agreed by the treaty to be void. The survey of five thousand acres having been made at a different place from the land granted , would if confirmed be a new appropriation of so much land, and void if it had been ordered by the governor of Florida ; and of course it is void, having nothing to uphold it but the act of the surveyor general. Ibid.
In the superior court of East Florida, the counsel for the claimant offered to introduce testimony in regard to the survey of three thousand acres ; and the counsel of the United States withdrew his objection to the testimony. The admission of the evidence did not prove the survey to have been made. Proof of the signature of the surveyor general to the return of survey made the survey prima facie evidence. Ibid.
The proof of the signature of Aguilar to the certificate of a copy of the grant by the governor of East Florida, authorizes its admission in evidence ; but this does not establish the validity of the concession. To test the validity of the survey, it was necessary to give it in evidence ; but the survey did not give a good title to the land. Ibid.
The United States have a right to disprove a survey made by the surveyor general, if the survey on the ground does not correspond to the land granted. Ibid.
On a petition from Pedro Miranda, stating services performed by him for Spain , governor White, the governor of East Florida, on the 26th November, 1810, made a grant to him of eight leagues square, or three hundred and sixty-eight thousand six hundred and forty acres of land on the waters of Hillsborough and Tampa Bay, in the eastern district of Florida. No survey was made under this grant while Florida remained a province of Spain, nor was any attempt made to occupy or survey the land, until after the cession of Florida to the United States. In 1821 , it was alleged that a survey was made by a surveyor of East Florida. Held , that the grant was void ; no land having been severed from the public domain previous to the 24th January, 1818 , and because the calls of the grant are too indefinite for locality to be given to them. The United States v. Miranda , 16 Peters , 153.
The settled doctrine of the Supreme Court, in respect to Florida grants, is, that grants embracing a wide extent of country, or with a large area of natural or artificial boundaries, and which granted lands were not surveyed before the 24th of January, 1818, and which are without such designation as will give a place of beginning for a survey, are not lands withdrawn from the maps of vacant lands, ceded to the United States in Florida, and are void ; as well on that account as for being so uncertain that locality cannot be given to them. Ibid.
On the 6th of April , 1816, a grant was made by the governor of Florida, of five miles square, or sixteen thousand acres of land, on condition that a mill should be built. The grant of six thousand acres was for land on Doctor's branch, where the mill was intended to be erected. The ten thousand acres were granted on the north-east side on the lagoon and of India river. The six thousand acres were surveyed in 1819, on Doctor's branch, and the mill was built. The survey under this grant was confirmed. The United States v. Low et al . 162.
According to the strict ideas of conforming a survey to a location , in the United States , the survey of ten thousand acres should be located adjoining the natural object called for, there being no other to

aid and control the general call ; and therefore, the head of the lagoon would necessarily have formed one boundary. But it is obvious, more latitude was allowed in the province of Florida, under the
government of Spain. The surveyor general having returned that the survey was made according to the grant, and in the absence of other contradictory proof, the claim was confirmed. Ibid.
A grant of five miles square, or sixteen thousand acres of land, was made by the Spanish governor of East Florida , at the mouth of the river Santa Lucia. The petition for the grant stated various merits
and losses of the petitioner, and asked the grant of five miles square, for the construction of a water saw-mill. The grant was given for the purpose mentioned, " and also paying attention to the services
and other matters set forth in the petition." No survey under the grant was made by the surveyor general of Florida ; but a survey was made by a private surveyor. The survey did not follow the calls of
the grant, and no proof was given that it was made at the place mentioned in the grant. The survey and
plat were not made according to the established rules relative to surveys to be made by the surveyor general under such grants. Nor was the plat made with the proportion of land on the river required by the regulations. The superior court of Florida held that the grant having been made in consideration of services rendered by the grantee, as well as for a water saw-mill, it was valid without the
erection of the mill ; but the survey was altogether void , and of no effect. The decree of the superior
court of Florida, by which the grant and survey were confirmed , was remanded to the superior court
of Florida ; that court to order the sixteen thousand acres granted, to be surveyed according to the principles stated in the opinion of the Supreme Court. It has often been held that the authorities of
Spain had the power to grant the public domain in accordance with their own ideas of the merits and
considerations presented by the grantee ; and that the powers of the Supreme Court of the United States extend only to the inquiry, whether, in fact, the grant had been made, and its legal effect when made,
in cases where the law by implication introduced a condition , or it was peculiar in its provisions. No
special ordinance of Spain introduces conditions into mill grants. The United States v. Hanson, 16 Peters, 196.
The certificate of a private surveyor, that he had permission from the governor of the territory to make a survey of the land granted , is no evidence of the fact. There is a marked and wide difference
in the effect of the certificate of the surveyor general and of a private individual , who assumes to certify without authority. Ibid.
A grant by a Spanish governor of Florida meant not, as in the states of the United States, a perfect
title ; but an incipient right, which, when surveyed , required confirmation by the governor. The duty
of confirmation by the acts of Congress is deputed to the courts of justice of the United States, in execution of the treaty with Spain. Ibid.
The same credence that was accorded to the return of the surveyor general by the Spanish government, is due to it by the courts of the United States. Plats and certificates, because of the official
character of the surveyor general , have accorded to them the force and character of a deposition. Ibid. A grant of fifteen thousand acres by the Spanish governor of East Florida, in consideration of im-
portant services performed in behalf of the government of Spain, to George Atkinson , confirmed by the Supreme Court. By the eighth article of the Florida treaty, no grants of land made after the 24th of January, 1818 , were valid ; nor could a survey be valid on lands other than those authorized by the grant. Still the power to survey in conformity to the concessions existed up to the change of flags. The United States v. Clarke, 16 Peters, 228.
Spain had the power to make grants founded on any consideration and subject to any restrictions within her dominions. If a grant was binding on that government, it is so on the United States, the
successor of Spain. All the grants of land made by the lawful authorities of the king of Spain, before the 24th of January, 1818, were by the treaty ratified and confirmed to the owners of the lands. Ibid.
The grant to Atkinson was for the land he mentioned in his petition, or for any other lands that were vacant. Three surveys were made of the lands within the quantity granted, not at the place specially mentioned in the grant, but at other places. Held, that these surveys were valid, notwithstanding that they were made at different places. Ibid.
A claim for eight thousand acres of land in East Florida , founded on a petition of Domingo Acosta to
governor Coppinger, made on the 20th of May, 1816. The petition stated that services had been performed by the claimant for the defence, support and advancement of the town of Fernandina, which had never been rewarded. Governor Coppinger gave a decree in favour of the petitioner, " it being the will of the sovereign that the merits of his subjects should be rewarded ." The originals of the petition and decree were not produced , they having been lost ; but a certificate signed by Don Thomas Aguilar, the secretary of the government, was exhibited , which stated that the copies of the petition and decree, which were given in evidence, had been faithfully drawn from the originals in his office. Four plats and certificates of survey, made by Clarke, surveyor of the province ; two of which surveys were made before the 24th January, 1818, and one on the 14th February, 1818 ; another on the 20th January, 1820 ; were given in evidence without objection, in the court below, to show the location of the land claimed. The decree of the superior court of Florida, in favour of the claimant, was affirmed. The United States v. Acosta, 17 Peters, 16. S. C. 1 How. 25.
The official certificates of the secretary of the government of Florida, during the dominion of Spain over the territory, after evidence that no originals could be found in the proper office, was sufficient evidence of the copies of the petition and decree of the governor ; no proof having been given to contradict or impair the force of the same. Ibid.
The governor of the territory of Florida, as the deputy of the king of Spain, was the sole judge of the merits on which the claim stated in the petition was founded ; and he had undoubted power to reward the merits of the grantee. This has been so decided in many cases. Ibid.
Although in the governor's decree, there may be no description of any place where the land granted

It appeared by the evidence, that the goods mentioned in the entry had been bought by the defendant

from John Wood, his father, of Saddleworth, England. No witness was produced by the United States

to prove that the value or cost of the goods was greater than that for which they were entered at the custom-house in New York. The evidence of this, offered by the prosecution was, the invoice book of

John Wood, and thirty-five original letters from the defendant to John Wood, between 1834 and 1837,

showing a combination between John Wood and the defendant to defraud the United States, by invoic-

ing and entering goods at less than their actual cost ; that this combination comprehended the goods imported in the Sheridan ; and that the goods received by that ship had been entered by the defendant,

SEC. 5. And be it further enacted, That the ad valorem rates of

duty upon goods, wares, and merchandise, shall be estimated in the man-

he knowing that they had cost more than the prices at which he had entered them. This evidence was objected to on the part of the defendant, as not competent proof to convict the defendant of the crime of perjury ; and that if an inference of guilt could be derived from such proof, it was an inference from circumstances, not sufficient, as the best legal testimony, to warrant a conviction. Held, That in order to a conviction, it was not necessary, on the part of the prosecution, to produce a living witness ;
if the jury should believe, from the within testimony, that the defendant made a false and corrupt oath when he entered the goods. The United States v. Wood, 14 Peters, 430.
The cases in which a living witness to a corpus delicti of the defendant, in a prosecution for perjury, may be dispensed with, are : all such where a person charged with a perjury by falsely swearing to a fact directly disproved by documentary or written testimony, springing from himself, with circumstances showing the corrupt intent : In cases where the perjury charged is contradicted by a public record, proved to have been well known to the defendant when he took the oath, the oath only proved to have been taken ; in cases where the party is charged with taking an oath contrary to what he must necessarily have known to be the truth , and the false swearing can be proved by his own letters relating to the fact sworn to, or by other written testimony existing and being found in the possession of the defendant, and which has been treated by him as containing the evidence of the fact recited in it. Ibid.
The letters of the defendant, showing his knowledge of the actual cost of the goods which had been falsely entered by him , are the best evidence which can be given. This evidence is good under the general principle that a man's own acts, conduct, and declarations, when voluntary, are always admissible in evidence against him. If the letters of the defendant showed that the invoice book of the vendor of the goods, containing an invoice of the goods enumerated in the invoice to which the defendant had sworn the owner's oath, in which book the goods were priced higher in the sale of them to the defendant, recognised the book as containing the true invoice, his admission supersedes the necessityof other proof to establish the real price given by him for the goods ; and the letters and invoice book in connection preponderate against the oath taken by the defendant, making a living witness to the corpus delicti charged in the indictment, unnecessary.

(a) Indictment for false swearing under the third section of the act of Congress of March 1 , 1823, which declares, that " any person who shall swear or affirm falsely, touching the expenditure of public
money, or in support of any claim against the United States, shall suffer as for wilful and corrupt perjury." The indictment charged the false swearing to be an affidavit made before a justice ofthe peace of Kentucky in support of a claim against the United States, under the act of July 5, 1832, ch. 173, to provide for liquidating and paying certain claims ofthe state of Virginia. By the Supreme Court-There is no statute of the United States which expressly authorizes any justice of the peace of the state, or any officer of the national government to administer an oath in support of any claim against the United States under the act of 1823. The United States v. Bailey, 9 Peters , 238.
The Secretary of the Treasury, in order to carry into effect the authority given to him, to liquidate and pay the claims referred to in the act of 1832 , had established a regulation authorizing affidavits made before any justice of the peace of a state, to be received and considered in proof of claims under the act. By implication, he possessed the power to make such a regulation , and to allow such affidavits in proof of claims under the act of 1832. It was incidental to his duty and authority in settling claims under the act. When the oath is taken before a state or national magistrate, authorized to ad-
minister oaths in pursuance of any regulations prescribed by the Treasury Department, or in conformity
with the practice of the Treasury Department, so that the affidavit would be admissible evidence at the Department in support of any claim against the United States, and the party swears falsely, the case is within the purview of the act of 1823. Ibid.
If a state magistrate shall administer an oath, under an act of Congress expressly giving him the power to do so, it would be a lawful oath, before one having competent authority, and as much so as if he had been specially appointed a commissioner under a law of the United States for that purpose , and such an oath, administered under such circumstances , would be within the purview ofthe act of 1823. Ibid.
The act of 1823 does not create or punish the crime of perjury, technically considered. But it creates a new and substantial offence of false swearing, and punishes it in the same manner as perjury.
The oath, therefore , need not be administered in a judicial proceeding, or in a case in which the state magistrate, under the state laws, had jurisdiction, so as to make the false swearing perjury. It would be sufficient, that it might be lawfully administered by the magistrate, and was not in violation of his official duty. Ibid.

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, A PROCLAMATION.

Whereas, by the sixth section of an Act of Congress, entitled " An act to regulate the commercial intercourse between the United States and certain
British colonial ports," which was approved on the first day of March, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and twenty-three, it is enacted, "that this act, unless repealed, altered or amended, by Congress, shall be and continue in force so long as the above enumerated British colonial ports shall be open to the admission of the vessels of the United States, conformably to the provisions of the British act of Parliament, of the twenty-fourth of June last, being the forty-fourth chapter of the acts of the third year of George the Fourth: but if at any time the trade and intercourse between the United States and all or any of the above enumerated British colonial ports, authorized by the said act of Parliament, should be prohibited by a British order in Council, or by act of Parliament, then , from the day of the date of such order in Council, or act of Parliament, or from the time that the same shall commence to be in force, proclamation to that effect having been made by the President of the United States, each and every provision of this act, so far as the same shall apply to the intercourse between the United States and the above enumerated British Colonial ports, in British vessels, shall cease to operate in their favour ; and each and every provision of the Act concerning navigation,' approved on the eighteenth of April, one thousand eight hundred and eighteen, and of the act supplementary thereto, approved on the fifteenth of M"ay, one thousand eight hundred and twenty, shall revive and be in full force :
And whereas, by an act of the British Parliament, which passed on the fifth day of July, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and twentyfive, entitled " An act to repeal the several laws relating to the customs," the said act of Parliament of the twenty-fourth of June, one thousand eight hundred and twenty-two, was repealed ; and by another act of the British Parliament, passed on the fifth day of July, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and twenty-five, in the sixth year of the reign of George the Fourth, entitled " An Act to regulate the trade of the British possessions abroad," and by an order of His Britannic Majesty in Council, bearing date the twentyseventh of July, one thousand eight hundred and twenty-six, the trade and intercourse authorized by the aforesaid act of Parliament, of the twenty-fourth of June, one thousand eight hundred and twenty-two, between the United States and the greater part of the said British Colonial ports therein enumerated, have been prohibited upon and from the first day of December last past, and the contingency has thereby arisen on which the President of the United States
was authorized by the sixth section aforesaid of the act of Congress of first March, one thousand eight hundred and twenty-three, to issue a proclamation to the effect therein mentioned :
Now, therefore, I, John Quincy Adams, President of the United States of America, do hereby declare and proclaim that the trade and intercourse authorized by the said act of Parliament of the twenty-fourth of June, one thousand eight hundred and twenty-two, between the United States and the British Colonial ports enumerated in the aforesaid act of Congress of the first of March, one thousand eight hundred and twenty-three, have been, and are, upon and from the first day of December, one thousand eight hundred and twentysix, by the aforesaid two several acts of Parliament of the fifth of July, one thousand eight hundred and twenty-five, and by the aforesaid British order in Council of the twenty-seventh day of July, one thousand eight hundred and twenty-six, prohibited.
