DECLARATION

Of the Commissioners under the fourth article of the Treaty of Ghent.

New Yor k , 24th Nov ember , 1817.
Sir ,
The undersigned commissioners, appointed by virtue of the fourth article of the treaty of Ghent, have attended to the duties assigned them ; and have decided that Moose Island, Dudley Island, and Frederick Island, in the Bay of Passamaquoddy, which is part of the Bay of Fundy, do each of them belong to the United States of America, and that all the other islands in the Bay of Passamaquoddy, and the Island of Grand Menan, in the Bay of Fundy, do each of them belong to his Britannic majesty, in conformity with the true intent of the second article of the treaty of peace of one thousand seven hundred and eighty-three. The commissioners have the honor to enclose herewith their decision.
In making this decision, it became necessary that each of the commissioners should yield a part of his individual opinion: several reasons induced them to adopt this measure; one of which was the impression and belief that the navigable waters of the Bay of Passamaquoddy, which, by the treaty of Ghent, is said to be part of the Bay of Fundy, are common to both parties for the purpose of all lawful and direct communication with their own territories and foreign ports.
