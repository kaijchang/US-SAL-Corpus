RESOLUTIONS.
I. Res olv ed by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America, in Congress assembled, That the expressions contained in the official letter of Francis J. Jackson, minister plenipotentiary of his Britannic majesty near the United States, dated the 23d day of October, 1809, and addressed to Mr. Smith, Secretary of State, conveying the idea that the executive government of the United States had a knowledge, that the arrangement lately made by Mr. Erskine, his predecessor, in behalf of his government, with the government of the United States, was entered into without competent powers on the part of Mr. Erskine for that purpose, were highly indecorous and insolent: That the repetition of the same intimation in his official letter dated the 4th of November, 1809, after he was apprised by the asseveration of the Secretary of State, that the executive government had no such knowledge, and that if it had possessed such knowledge, such arrangement would not have been entered into on the part of the United States; and after also being officially apprised, that such intimation was inadmissible, was still more insolent and affronting; and that in refusing to receive any further communications from him, in consequence of these outrageous and premeditated insults, the executive government has manifested a just regard to its own dignity and honour, as well as to the character and interest of the American people: That the letter, signed Francis J. Jackson, headed " Circular," dated 13th November, 1809, and published and circulated through the country, is a still more direct and aggravated insult and affront to the American people and their government, as it is evidently an insidious attempt to excite their resentments and distrusts against their own government, by appealing to them, through false or fallacious disguises, against some of its acts; and to excite resentments and divisions amongst the people, themselves, which can only be dishonourable to their own characters and ruinous to their own interests: And the Congress of the United States do hereby solemnly pledge themselves to the American people, and to the world, to stand by and support the executive government in its refusal to receive any further communications from the said Francis J. Jackson, and to call into action the whole force of the nation, if it should become necessary, in consequence of the conduct of the executive government in this respect, to repel such insults, and to assert and maintain the rights, the honour and the interests of the United States.

time for making the last payment on account of such purchase according to former laws, may have expired or shall expire on or before the
first day of January next, shall be allowed a further term of two years, for the payment of the residue of the principal due on account of such purchase; which further term of two years shall be calculated to commence from the expiration of one year from and after the day on which the last payment on account of such purchase should, according to former laws, have become due, and shall be allowed only on the following conditions, that is to say: First, that all the arrears of interest on the land purchased to the end of one year, from and after the day on which the last payment on account of such purchase should, according to former laws, have become due, shall have been paid at or before the end of such year: Second, that the residue of the sum due on account of the principal of such purchase shall be paid with interest thereon, in

And all monies which such original purchaser may have paid shall be replaced to his credit, by the receiver of public monies of the respective landoffices, and such re-purchasers shall be allowed the same benefits of the extension of the time of payment, created by this act, as though no such reversion had occurred: Provided, such original purchaser shall make to the proper land officer such application for such re-entry, as is required by law for the entry of lands, on or before first day of June
next, and the land so reverted shall not have then been previously resold.

Wher eas the territory south of the Mississippi Territory and eastward of the River Mississippi and extending to the River Perdido, of which possession was not delivered to the United States in pursuance of the treaty concluded at Paris, on the 30th April, 1803, has at all times, as is well known, been considered and claimed by them, as being within the colony of Louisiana conveyed by the said treaty, in the same extent that it had in the hands of Spain, and that it had when France originally possessed it.
And whereas, the acquiescence of the United States in the temporary continuance of the said territory under the Spanish authority was not the result of any distrust of their title, as has been particularly evinced by the general

Preamble as to title of the Uni-
ted States to the territory south of Mississippi Territory, eastward of Mississippi River and extending to the River Perdido.

tenor of their laws, and by the distinction made in the application of those laws

between that territory and foreign countries, but was occasioned by their con-

ciliatory views, and by a confidence in the justice of their cause ; and in the suc-

cess of candid discussion and amicable negotiation with a just and friendly

power.

And whereas a satisfactory adjustment, too long delayed, without the fault of

the United States, has for some time been entirely suspended by events over

which they had no control, and whereas a crisis has at length arrived subversive

of the order of things under the Spanish authorities, whereby a failure of the

United States to take the said territory into its possession may lead to events

ultimately contravening the views of both parties, whilst in the mean time the

tranquillity and security of our adjoining territories are endangered, and new

facilities given to violations of our revenue and commercial laws, and of those

prohibiting the introduction of slaves.

Considering, moreover, that under these peculiar and imperative circumstances,

a forbearance on the part of the United States to occupy the territory in ques-

tion, and thereby guard against the confusions and contingencies which threaten

it, might be construed into a dereliction of their title, or an insensibility to the

importance of the state: considering that in the hands of the United States it

will not cease to be a subject of fair and friendly negotiation and adjustment:

considering finally that the acts of Congress tho' contemplating a present pos-

session by a foreign authority, have contemplated also an eventual possession of

the said territory by the United States, and are accordingly so framed, as in

that case to extend in their operation, to the same:

Now be it known that I, JAMES MADISON, President of the United States Possession to of America, in pursuance of these weighty and urgent considerations, have be taken of said deemed it right and requisite, that possession should be taken of the said ter- territory.

No. 13. Directing the British Blockade of the Coast of the United States to be disregarded.

June 29, 1814. BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

A PROCLAMATION.

Recital as to

Whe re as it is manifest that the blockade, which has been proclaimed by the

illegality of Brit- enemy, of the whole Atlantic coast of the United States, nearly two thousand

ish blockade. miles in extent, and abounding in ports, harbors, and navigable inlets, cannot

be carried into effect by any adequate force actually stationed for the purpose ; and it is rendered a matter of certainty and notoriety, by the multiplied and

daily arrivals and departures of the public and private armed vessels of the

United States, and of other vessels, that no such adequate force has been so

stationed: And whereas a blockade thus destitute of the character of a regular

and legal blockade, as defined and recognized by the established law of nations,

whatever other purposes it may be made to answer, forms no lawful prohibition

or obstacle to such neutral and friendly vessels as may choose to visit and trade

with the United States ; and whereas it accords with the interest and the amicable views of the United States, to favor and promote, as far as may be, the free

and mutually beneficial commercial intercourse of all friendly nations disposed

to engage therein, and with that view to afford to their vessels, destined to. the United States, a more positive and satisfactory security against all interruptions,

molestations, or vexations whatever from the cruisers of the United States : Now be it known that I, JAMES MADISON, President of the United States
of America, do, by this my proclamation, strictly order and instruct all the public armed vessels of the United States, and all private armed vessels commissioned as privateers, or with letters of marque and reprisal, not to interrupt, detain, or
otherwise molest or vex, any vessels whatever belonging to neutral powers, or the subjects or citizens thereof, which vessels shall be actually bound and proceeding to any port or place within the jurisdiction of the United States .; but on the contrary to render to all such vessels all the aid and kind offices which they

may need or require. Given under my hand and the seal of the United States at the city of
