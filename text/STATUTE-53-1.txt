PREFACE
The Internal Revenue Code, approved February 10, 1939 , and published in this volume as Public Act No. 1 of the Seventy-sixth Congress, is the first Federal act of its kind since the Revised Statutes of the United States, approved June 22, 1874. Title XXXV of the Revised Statutes embraces the general and permanent statutes relating exclusively to internal revenue, in force on December 1 , 1873 .
The internal revenue title, which comprises all of the Code except the preliminary sections relating to its enactment, is intended to contain all the United States statutes of a general and permanent nature relating exclusively to internal revenue, in force on January 2 , 1939 ; also such of the temporary statutes of that description as relate to taxes the occasion of which may arise after the enactment of the Code. These statutes are codified without substantive change and with only such change of form as is required by arrangement and consolidation. The title contains no provision, except for effective date, not derived from a law approved prior to January 3 , 1939.
The derivation of the title, in its textual sequence, is shown in the appendix, part I, table A. Conversely, the placement of the statutes in the title, cited in their chronological order, is shown in table B. The Revised Statutes of the United States and the Statutes at Large of the United States are the sources of the law codified. The Revised Statutes cover the period ended December 1 , 1873. The Statutes at
Large codified cover the period following December 1, 1873 , and are published in the 35 volumes numbered 18 to 52, inclusive . The separate enactments carried into the internal revenue title, wholly or in part, from the Statutes at Large are 143 in number, exclusive of 93 statutes involving express amendment, reenactment, or repeal . The 277 Revised Statutes sections codified were derived from 21 basic
statutes. The whole body of internal revenue law in effect on January 2 , 1939, therefore, has its ultimate origin in 164 separate enactments of Congress. The earliest of these was approved July 1 , 1862 ; the latest, June 16 , 1938.
The Internal Revenue Code is an enactment without change of the 1939 edition of the Codification of Internal Revenue Laws prepared by Mr. Colin F. Stam and Mr. L. L. Stratton, of the staff of the Joint Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation, with the assistance of the Department of the Treasury and the Department of Justice. The bill embodying that codification, H. R. 2762, was introduced on January 18, 1939, by Mr. Doughton, of North Carolina, chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives and vice chairman of the Joint Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation. Mr. Doughton submitted the unanimously favorable report of the Committee on Ways and Means on January 20. Unanimous consent for consideration of the bill was requested and objected to on January 23. It was called up on the following Calendar Wednesday, January 25, and passed on that date by a vote of 350 to 16. On January 27, the bill was messaged to the Senate and referred to the Committee on Finance, before whom a hearing was held on the 30th. At the direction of Mr. Harrison, of Mississippi, chairman of the Joint Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation and of the Committee
iii

iv

PREFACE

on Finance, Mr. George, of Georgia, a member of both committees , submitted the unanimously favorable report of the Committee on Finance on February 1. The bill was considered by the Senate on the following day and passed without a record vote.
The 1939 codification was the fourth to be published by the staff of the Joint Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation. The first, published in 1930 , embraced the general and permanent internal revenue laws in force on December 1 , 1930 ; the second, published in 1933 , the laws in force on July 16 , 1932 ; and the third, published in 1938 , the laws in force at the beginning of that year.
In the preparation of these codifications, invaluable assistance was received from the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Justice, and the Legislative Reference Service of the Library of Congress . To the Division of Research and Publication of the Department of State grateful acknowledgment is made of the index to this volume and of their expert aid in the revision of the proof of the appendix.
The appendix, published under the provisions of section 9 of the Internal Revenue Code, is divided into four parts. Part I consists of tables of reference to internal revenue statutes. Tables A and B have been described above . Table C cites the statutes expressly repealed, in whole or in part, together with the repealing statutes. Table D cites the statutes expressly amended or reenacted , with the amending or reenacting statutes. The derivation of the sections of the Revised Statutes relating to internal revenue is shown in table E. Mr. W. H. McClenon , of the Legislative Reference Service of the Library of Congress , rendered indispensable aid in the preparation of these tables , as well as of the Code generally.
Part II of the appendix contains the provisions of the Constitution of the United States relating to taxation.
Part III of the appendix, prepared by the Department of the Treasury, contains miscellaneous statutory and treaty provisions affecting the administration of internal revenue laws but omitted from the Code
for the reason that they are of a temporary nature or do not relate exclusively to internal revenue.
Part IV of the appendix digests several court opinions construing the repeal provisions of the Revised Statutes . The similarity of the repeal provisions of the Revised Statutes and those of the Code suggests the possible applicability of these decisions to questions that may arise affecting the Code.

stituting a distribution in complete liquidation within the meaning of this paragraph shall not be considered as not constituting such a distribution merely because it does not constitute a distribution or liquidation within the meaning of the corporate law under which the distribution is made ; and for the purposes of this para-
graph a transfer of property of such other corporation to the taxpayer shall not be considered as not constituting a distribution (or one of a series of distributions) in complete cancellation or redemption of all the stock of such other corporation, merely because the carrying out of the plan involves ( i ) the transfer under

(1) If the corporation receiving such other property or money distributes it in pursuance of the plan of reorganization, no gain to the corporation shall be recognized from the exchange, but

the gain, if any, to the corporation shall be recognized, but in an amount not in excess of the sum of such money and the fair market value of such other property so received, which is not so distributed. (e) Loss FROM EXCHANGES NOT SOLELY IN KIND.- If an exchange would be within the provisions of subsection (b) ( 1 ) to ( 5) , inclu-
sive, of this section if it were not for the fact that the property received in exchange consists not only of property permitted by such paragraph to be received without the recognition of gain or loss, but also of other property or money, then no loss from the exchange shall be recognized .

If the property so acquired consisted in part of the type of property permitted by section 112 (b) to be received without the recognition of gain or loss, and in part of other property, the basis provided in this paragraph shall be allocated between the properties (other than money) received, and for the purpose of the allocation there shall be assigned to such other property an amount equivalent to its fair market value at the date of the exchange. This paragraph shall not apply to property acquired by a corporation by the issuance of its stock or securities as the consideration in whole
or in part for the transfer of the property to it.

(B) as paid-in surplus or as a contribution to capital, then the basis shall be the same as it would be in the hands of
the transferor, increased in the amount of gain or decreased in the amount of loss recognized to the transferor upon such transfer under the law applicable to the year in which the transfer was made .
(9) INVOLUNTARY CONVERSION.- If the property was acquired, after February 28, 1913, as the result of a compulsory or involuntary conversion described in section 112 ( f) , the basis shall be the same as in the case of the property so converted, decreased in the amount of any money received by the taxpayer which was not expended in accordance with the provisions of law (applicable to the year in which such conversion was made) determining the taxable status of the gain or loss upon such conversion, and increased in the amount of gain or decreased in the amount of loss to the taxpayer recognized upon such conversion under the law applicable to the year in which such conversion was made.

posed of, increased or decreased, as the case may be, by the difference, if any, between the price at which the property was acquired and the price at which such substantially identical stock or securities were sold or otherwise disposed of.

(13) PARTNERSHIPS.-If the property was acquired , after February 28, 1913, by a partnership and the basis is not otherwise
determined under any other paragraph of this subsection, then the basis shall be the same as it would be in the hands of the trans-
feror, increased in the amount of gain or decreased in the amount of loss recognized to the transferor upon such transfer under the law applicable to the year in which the transfer was made. If the property was distributed in kind by a partnership to any partner, the basis of such property in the hands of the partner shall be such part of the basis in his hands of his partnership interest as is properly allocable to such property.
(14) PROPERTY ACQUIRED BEFORE MARCH 1, 1913.--In the case of property acquired before March 1 , 1913, if the basis otherwise determined under this subsection, adjusted (for the period prior
to March 1, 1913) as provided in subsection (b) , is less than the fair market value of the property as of March 1, 1913, then the basis for determining gain shall be such fair market value. In determining the fair market value of stock in a corporation as of

(A) by reference to the basis in the hands of a transferor, donor, or grantor, or
(B) by reference to other property held at any time by the person for whom the basis is to be determined. Whenever it appears that the basis of property in the hands of the taxpayer is a substituted basis, then the adjustments provided in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be made after first mak-
ing in respect of such substituted basis proper adjustments of a similar nature in respect of the period during which the property was held by the transferor, doñor, or grantor, or during which the other property was held by the person for whom the basis is to be determined. A similar rule shall be applied in the case of a series of substituted bases.
SEC. 114. BASIS FOR DEPRECIATION AND DEPLETION.
(a) BASIS FOR DEPRECIATION.-The basis upon which exhaustion, wear and tear, and obsolescence are to be allowed in respect of any property shall be the adjusted basis provided in section 113 (b) for the purpose of determining the gain upon the sale or other disposition of such property.
(b) BASIS FOR DEPLETION.-
(1) GENERAL RULE.-The basis upon which depletion is to be allowed in respect of any property shall be the adjusted basis provided in section 113 (b) for the purpose of determining the gain upon the sale or other disposition of such property, except as provided in paragraphs (2) , (3) , and ( 4) of this subsection.
(2) DISCOVERY VALUE IN CASE OF MINES.-In the case of mines (other than metal, coal , or sulphur mines) discovered by the taxpayer after February 28, 1913, the basis for depletion shall be the fair market value of the property at the date of discovery or within thirty days thereafter, if such mines were not acquired as the result of purchase of a proven tract or lease, and if the fair market value of the property is materially disproportionate to the cost. The depletion allowance under section 23 (m) based on discovery value provided in this paragraph shall not exceed 50 per centum of the net income of the taxpayer (computed without allowance for depletion) from the property upon which the discovery was made, except that in no case shall the depletion allowance under section 23 (m) be less than it would be if computed without reference to discovery value. Discoveries shall include minerals in commercial quantities contained within a vein or deposit discovered in an existing mine or mining tract by the taxpayer after February 28, 1913, if the vein or deposit thus discovered was not merely the uninterrupted extension of a continu-
ing commercial vein or deposit already known to exist, and if the discovered minerals are of sufficient value and quantity that they could be separately mined and marketed at a profit.
(3) PERCENTAGE DEPLETION FOR OIL AND GAS WELLS.-In the case of oil and gas wells the allowance for depletion under section 23 (m) shall be 272 per centum of the gross income from the property during the taxable year, excluding from such gross income an amount equal to any rents or royalties paid or incurred by the taxpayer in respect of the property. Such allowance shall not exceed 50 per centum of the net income of the taxpayer (computed without allowance for depletion) from the property, except
that in no case shall the depletion allowance under section 23 (m) be less than it would be if computed without reference to this paragraph.
(4) PERCENTAGE DEPLETION FOR COAL AND METAL MINES AND SULPHUR.-The allowance for depletion under section 23 (m) shall be, in the case of coal mines, 5 per centum, in the case of metal mines, 15 per centum, and, in the case of sulphur mines or deposits,

46

CODIFICATION OF INTERNAL REVENUE LAWS

23 per centum, of the gross income from the property during the taxable year, excluding from such gross income an amount equal to any rents or royalties paid or incurred by the taxpayer in respect of the property. Such allowance shall not exceed 50 per centum of the net income of the taxpayer (computed without allowance for depletion) from the property. A taxpayer making his first return under this chapter in respect of a property shall state whether he elects to have the depletion allowance for such property for the taxable year for which the return is made computed with or without regard to percentage depletion, and the depletion allowance in respect of such property for such year shall be computed according to the election thus made. If the taxpayer fails to make such statement in the return, the depletion allowance for such property for such year shall be computed without reference to percentage depletion. The method, determined as above, of computing the depletion allowance shall be applied in the case of the property for all taxable years in which it is in the hands of such taxpayer, or of any other person if the basis of the property (for determining gain) in his hands is, under section 113 , determined by reference to the basis in the hands of such taxpayer, either directly or through one or more substituted bases, as defined in that section. The above right of election shall be subject to the qualification that this paragraph shall, for the purpose of determining whether the method of computing the depletion allowance follows the property, be considered a continuation of section 114 (b) (4) of the Revenue Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 710, and the Revenue Act of 1936, 49 Stat. 1686, and the Revenue Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 494, and as giving no new election in cases where either of such sections would, if applied, give no new election. SEC. 115. DISTRIBUTIONS BY CORPORATIONS.
(a) DEFINITION OF DIVIDEND.-The term "dividend" when used
in this chapter (except in section 203 ( a ) (3 ) and section 207 (c) (1 ) , relating to insurance companies) means any distribution made by a corporation to its shareholders, whether in money or in other prop-
erty, (1 ) out of its earnings or profits accumulated after February 28, 1913, or (2) out of the earnings or profits of the taxable year (computed as of the close of the taxable year without diminution by reason of any distributions made during the taxable year) , without regard to the amount of the earnings and profits at the time the distribution was made.
(b) SOURCE OF DISTRIBUTIONS.-For the purposes of this chapter every distribution is made out of earnings or profits to the extent thereof, and from the most recently accumulated earnings or profits. Any earnings or profits accumulated , or increase in value of property accrued, before March 1 , 1913, may be distributed exempt from tax, after the earnings and profits accumulated after February 28, 1913, have been distributed, but any such tax-free distribution shall be applied against and reduce the adjusted basis of the stock provided in section 113 .
(c) DISTRIBUTIONS IN LIQUIDATION.-Amounts distributed in com-
plete liquidation of a corporation shall be treated as in full payment in exchange for the stock, and amounts distributed in partial liqui-
dation of a corporation shall be treated as in part or full payment in exchange for the stock. The gain or loss to the distributee resulting from such exchange shall be determined under section 111, but shall be recognized only to the extent provided in section 112. Despite the provisions of section 117, the gain so recognized shall be considered as a short-term capital gain, except in the case of amounts distributed
in complete liquidation. For the purpose of the preceding sentence, "complete liquidation" includes any one of a series of distributions
made by a corporation in complete cancellation or redemption of all of its stock in accordance with a bona fide plan of liquidation and

INCOME TAX

47

under which the transfer of the property under the liquidation is to be completed within a time specified in the plan, not exceeding, from the close of the taxable year during which is made the first of the series of distributions under the plan, (1 ) three years, if the first of such series of distributions is made in a taxable year beginning after December 31 , 1937, or (2) two years, if the first of such series of distributions was made in a taxable year beginning before January 1 , 1938. In the case of amounts distributed (whether before January 1 , 1939, or on or after such date) in partial liquidation (other than a distribution to which the provisions of subsection (h) of this section are applicable ) the part of such distribution which is properly chargeable to capital account shall not be considered a distribution of earnings or profits. If any distribution in complete liquidation (including any one of a series of distributions made by the corporation in complete cancellation or redemption of all its stock) is made by a foreign corporation which with respect to any taxable year beginning on or before, and ending after, August 26, 1937, was a foreign personal holding company, and with respect to which a United States group (as defined in section 331 (a) (2) ) existed after August 26, 1937, and before January 1 , 1938, then, despite the foregoing provisions of this subsection, the gain recognized resulting from such distribution shall be considered as a shortterm capital gain-
Unless such liquidation is completed before July 1 , 1938 ; or Unless (if it is established to the satisfaction of the Commissioner by evidence submitted before July 1 , 1938, that due to the laws of the foreign country in which such corporation is incorporated , or for other reason, it is or will be impossible to complete the liquidation of such company before such date) the liquidation is completed on or before such date as the Commis-
sioner may find reasonable, but not later than December 31, 1938. (d) OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS FROM CAPITAL.-If any distribution (not in partial or complete liquidation) made by a corporation to its shareholders is not out of increase in value of property accrued before March 1 , 1913, and is not a dividend, then the amount of such distribution shall be applied against and reduce the adjusted basis of the stock provided in section 113, and if in excess of such basis, such excess shall be taxable in the same manner as a gain from the sale or exchange of property. (e) DISTRIBUTIONS BY PERSONAL SERVICE CORPORATIONS.-Any distribution made by a corporation, which was classified as a personal service corporation under the provisions of the Revenue Act of 1918
or the Revenue Act of 1921, out of its earnings or profits which_were taxable in accordance with the provisions of section 218 of the Revenue Act of 1918, 40 Stat. 1070, or section 218 of the Revenue Act
of 1921 , 42 Stat. 245 , shall be exempt from tax to the distributees. (f) STOCK DIVIDENDS.(1) GENERAL RULE.-A distribution made by a corporation to its shareholders in its stock or in rights to acquire its stock shall not be treated as a dividend to the extent that it does not consti-
tute income to the shareholder within the meaning of the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution.
(2) ELECTION OF SHAREHOLDERS AS TO MEDIUM OF PAYMENT.Whenever a distribution by a corporation is, at the election of any of the shareholders (whether exercised before or after the declaration thereof) , payable either (A) in its stock or in rights to acquire its stock, of a class which if distributed without election
would be exempt from tax under paragraph ( 1 ) , or (B) in money or any other property (including its stock or in rights to acquire its stock, of a class which if distributed without election would not be exempt from tax under paragraph (1) ) , then the distribution shall constitute a taxable dividend in the hands of all shareholders, regardless of the medium in which paid.

(g) REDEMPTION OF STOCK.- If a corporation cancels or redeems its stock ( whether or not such stock was issued as a stock dividend ) at such time and in such manner as to make the distribution and cancellation or redemption in whole or in part essentially equivalent to the distribution of a taxable dividend, the amount so distributed in redemption or cancellation of the stock, to the extent that it represents a distribution of earnings or profits accumulated after February 28, 1913 , shall be treated as a taxable dividend.
(h) EFFECT ON EARNINGS AND PROFITS OF DISTRIBUTIONS OF STOCK.The distribution (whether before January 1 , 1939, or on or after such date) to a distributee by or on behalf of a corporation of its stock or securities, of stock or securities in another corporation, or of property or money, shall not be considered a distribution of earnings or profits of any corporation--
(1 ) if no gain to such distributee from the receipt of such stock or securities, property or money, was recognized by law, or
(2) if the distribution was not subject to tax in the hands of such distributee because it did not constitute income to him within
the meaning of the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution or because exempt to him under section 115 ( f) of the Revenue Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 712, or a corresponding provision of a prior Revenue Act. As used in this subsection the term "stock or securities" includes rights to acquire stock or securities. (i) DEFINITION OF PARTIAL LIQUIDATION.-As used in this section the term "amounts distributed in partial liquidation" means a distribution by a corporation in complete cancellation or redemption of a part of its stock, or one of a series of distributions in complete cancellation or redemption of all or a portion of its stock.

(k) CONSENT DISTRIBUTIONS.-- For taxability as dividends of amounts agreed to be included in
gross income by shareholders' consents, see section 28.

(b) If no amount is shown as the tax by the taxpayer upon his return, or if no return is made by the taxpayer, then the amount by which the tax exceeds the amounts previously assessed (or collected without assessment) as a deficiency ; but such amounts previously assessed, or collected without assessment, shall first be decreased by the amounts previously abated, credited, refunded, or otherwise repaid in respect of such tax. SEC. 272. PROCEDURE IN GENERAL.
(a) (1 ) PETITION TO BOARD OF TAX APPEALS.--If in the case of any taxpayer, the Commissioner determines that there is a deficiency in respect of the tax imposed by this chapter, the Commissioner is authorized to send notice of such deficiency to the taxpayer by registered mail. Within ninety days after such notice is mailed (not counting Sunday or a legal holiday in the District of Columbia as the ninetieth day) , the taxpayer may file a petition with the Board of Tax Appeals for a redetermination of the deficiency. No assessment of a deficiency in respect of the tax imposed by this chapter and no distraint or proceeding in court for its collection shall be made, begun, or prosecuted until such notice has been mailed to the taxpayer, nor until the expiration of such ninety-day period, nor, if a petition has been filed with the Board, until the decision of the Board has become final. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 3653 (a) the making of such assessment or the beginning of such proceeding or distraint during the time such prohibition is in force may be enjoined by a proceeding in the proper court. In the case of a joint return filed by husband and wife such notice of deficiency may be a single joint notice, except that if the Commissioner has been notified by either spouse that separate residences have been established, then, in lieu

(b) COLLECTION OF DEFICIENCY FOUND BY BOARD.-If the taxpayer files a petition with the Board, the entire amount redetermined as the deficiency by the decision of the Board which has become final shall be assessed and shall be paid upon notice and demand from the col-
lector. No part of the amount determined as a deficiency by the Commissioner but disallowed as such by the decision of the Board which has become final shall be assessed or be collected by distraint or by proceeding in court with or without assessment.
(c) FAILURE TO FILE PETITION.- If the taxpayer does not file a petition with the Board within the time prescribed in subsection (a ) of this section, the deficiency, notice of which has been mailed to the taxpayer, shall be assessed, and shall be paid upon notice and demand from the collector.

(e) INCREASE OF DEFICIENCY AFTER NOTICE MAILED.-The Board shall have jurisdiction to redetermine the correct amount of the deficiency even if the amount so redetermined is greater than the amount of the deficiency, notice of which has been mailed to the taxpayer, and to determine whether any penalty, additional amount or addition to the tax should be assessed-if claim therefor is
asserted by the Commissioner at or before the hearing or a rehearing. (f) FURTHER DEFICIENCY LETTERS RESTRICTED.-If the Commis-

Except as provided in section 273 ( relating to jeopardy assessments) , that part of the deficiency so prorated to any installment the date for payment of which has not arrived, shall be collected at the same time as and as part of such installment. That part of the deficiency so prorated to any installment the date for payment of which has arrived, shall be paid upon notice and demand from the collector.
(j ) EXTENSION OF TIME FOR PAYMENT OF DEFICIENCIES.-Where it is shown to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that the payment of a deficiency upon the date prescribed for the payment thereof will result in undue hardship to the taxpayer the Commissioner, under regulations prescribed by the Commissioner, with the approval of the Secretary, may grant an extension for the payment of such deficiency for a period not in excess of eighteen months, and, in exceptional cases, for a further period not in excess of twelve months. If an extension is granted, the Commissioner may require the taxpayer to furnish a bond in such amount, not exceeding double the amount of the deficiency, and with such sureties, as the Commissioner deems necessary, conditioned upon the payment of the deficiency in accordance with the terms of the extension .

SUBCHAPTER D- UNJUST ENRICHMENT
SEC. 700. TAX ON NET INCOME FROM CERTAIN SOURCES.
(a) The following taxes shall be levied , collected , and paid for each taxable year (in addition to any other tax on net income) , upon the net income of every person which arises from the sources specified below :
(1 ) A tax equal to 80 per centum of that portion of the net income from the sale of articles with respect to which a Federal excise tax was imposed on such person but not paid which is attributable to shifting to others to any extent the burden of such Federal excise tax and which does not exceed such person's net income for the entire taxable year from the sale of articles with respect to which such Federal excise tax was imposed.
(2) A tax equal to 80 per centum of the net income from reimbursement received by such person from his vendors of amounts representing Federal excise-tax burdens included in prices paid by such person to such vendors, to the extent that such net income does not exceed the amount of such Federal excise-tax burden which such person in turn shifted to his vendees.
(3) A tax equal to 80 per centum of the net income from refunds or credits to such person from the United States of Federal excise taxes erroneously or illegally collected with respect to any articles, to the extent that such net income does not exceed the amount of the burden of such Federal excise taxes with respect to such articles which such person shifted to others. (b) The net income (specified in subsection (a ) ( 1 ) ) from the sale of articles with respect to which the Federal excise tax was not paid, and the net income specified in subsection ( a) (2) or ( 3 ) , shall not include the net income from the sale of any article, from reimbursement with respect to any article, or from refund or credit of Federal excise tax with respect to any article ( 1 ) if such article (or the articles processed therefrom) were not sold by the taxpayer on or before the date of the termination of the Federal excise tax ; (2) if the taxpayer made a tax adjustment with respect to such article (or the articles processed therefrom) with his vendee ; or (3) if under the terms of any statute the taxpayer would have been entitled to a refund from the United States of the Federal excise tax

ADDITIONAL INCOME TAXES

113

with respect to the article otherwise than as an erroneous or illegal collection (assuming, in case the tax was not paid , that it had been paid) .
(c) The net income from the sales specified in subsection (a) ( 1 ) shall be computed as follows :
(1) From the gross income from such sales there shall be deducted the allocable portion of the deductions from gross income
for the taxable year which are allowable under the applicable Revenue Act ; or
(2) If the taxpayer so elects by filing his return on such basis, the total net income for the taxable year from the sale of all articles with respect to which each Federal excise tax was imposed (computed by deducting from the gross income from such sales the allocable portion of the deductions from gross income which are allowable under the applicable Revenue Act, but without deduction of the amount of such Federal excise tax which was paid or of the amount of reimbursement to purchasers with respect to such Federal excise tax) shall be divided by the total quantity of such articles sold during the taxable year and the quotient shall be multiplied by the quantity of such articles involved in the sales specified in subsection (a) ( 1 ) . Such quantities shall be expressed in terms of the unit on the basis of which the Federal excise tax
was imposed. For the purposes of this section the proper apportionment and allocation of deductions with respect to gross income shall be determined under rules and regulations prescribed by the Commissioner with the approval of the Secretary.
(d) The net income from reimbursement or refunds specified in subsection ( a) ( 2 ) or ( 3 ) shall be computed as follows : From the total payment or accrual ( 1 ) of reimbursement to the taxpayer from vendors for amounts representing Federal excise tax burdens included in prices paid by the taxpayer to such vendors or ( 2 ) of refunds or credits to the taxpayer of Federal excise taxes erroneously or illegally collected, there shall be deducted the expenses and fees reasonably incurred in obtaining such reimbursement or refunds.
(e) For the purposes of subsection ( a ) ( 1) , ( 2 ) , and (3) , the extent to which the taxpayer shifted to others the burden of a Federal excise tax shall be presumed to be an amount computed as follows :
(1) From the selling price of the articles there shall be deducted the sum of (A) the cost of such articles plus (B ) the average margin with respect to the quantity involved ; or
(2) If the taxpayer so elects by filing his return on such basis, from the aggregate selling price of all articles with respect to which such Federal excise tax was imposed and which were sold by him during the taxable year (computed without deduction of reimbursement to purchasers with respect to such Federal excise tax) there shall be deducted the aggregate cost of such articles, and the difference shall be reduced to a margin per unit in terms of the basis on which the Federal excise tax was imposed . The excess of such margin per unit over the average margin (computed for the same unit) shall be multiplied by the number of such units represented by the articles with respect to which the computation is being made ; but
(3) In no case shall the extent to which the taxpayer shifted to others the burden of the Federal excise tax with respect to the articles be deemed to exceed the amount of such tax with respect
to such articles minus (A) the portion of the amount of the Federal excise tax (or of the reimbursement specified in subsection ( a) (2) ) with respect to the articles which is paid or credited by the taxpayer to any purchasers as specified in subsection ( f) (3) and

114

CODIFICATION OF INTERNAL REVENUE LAWS

minus (B) the amount of any increase in the tax under section 3400 for which the taxpayer under this section became liable as the result of the nonpayment or refund of the Federal excise tax with respect to the articles.
(f) As used in this section( 1) The term "margin" means the difference between the selling
price of articles and the cost thereof, and the term "average margin" means the average difference between the selling price and the cost of similar articles sold by the taxpayer during his six taxable years preceding the initial imposition of the Federal excise tax in question, except that if during any part of such six-year period the taxpayer was not in business, or if his records for any part of such period are so inadequate as not to furnish satisfactory data, the average margin of the taxpayer for such part of such period shall, when necessary for a fair comparison, be deemed to be the average margin, as determined by the Commissioner, of representative concerns engaged in a similar business and similarly circumstanced .
(2) The term "cost" means, in the case of articles manufactured or produced by the taxpayer, the cost to the taxpayer of materials entering into the articles ; or, in the case of articles purchased by the taxpayer for resale, the price paid by him for such articles (reduced in both cases by the amount for which he is reimbursed by his vendor) .
(3) The term "selling price" means selling price minus (A) amounts subsequently paid or credited to the purchaser on or before June 1, 1936, or thereafter in the bona fide settlement of a written agreement entered into on or before March 3 , 1936, as reimbursement for the amount included in such price on account of a Federal excise tax ; and minus (B) the allocable portion of any professional fees and expenses of litigation incurred in securing the refund or preventing the collection of the Federal excise tax, not to exceed 10 per centum of the amount of such tax. (g) In determining costs, selling prices, and net income, the taxpayer shall, unless otherwise shown, be deemed to have sold articles in the order in which they were manufactured, produced, or acquired.
Where the taxpayer's records do not adequately establish the quantity of a commodity taxable under the Agricultural Adjustment Act, 48 Stat. 31, as amended , entering into articles sold by him, such quantities shall be computed by the use of the conversion factors prescribed in regulations under such Act, as amended .
(h) If the taxpayer made any purchase or sale otherwise than through an arm's-length transaction, and at a price other than the fair market price, the Commissioner may determine the purchase or sale price to be that for which such purchases or sales were at that time made in the ordinary course of trade.
(i ) Either the taxpayer or the Commissioner may rebut the presumption established by subsection (e) by proof of the actual extent to which the taxpayer shifted to others the burden of the Federal excise tax. Such proof may include, but shall not be limited to :
(1) Proof that the change or lack of change in the margin was due to changes in factors other than the tax. Such factors shall include any clearly shown change (A ) in the type or grade of article or materials, or (B) in costs of production. If the taxpayer asserts that the burden of the tax was borne by him while the burden of any other increased cost was shifted to others, the Commissioner shall determine, from the respective effective dates of the tax and of the other increase in cost as
compared with the date of the change in margin, and from the general experience of the industry, whether the tax or the increase in other cost was shifted to others. If the Commissioner deter-

ADDITIONAL INCOME TAXES

115

mines that the change in margin was due in part to the tax and in part to the increase in other cost, he shall apportion the change in margin between them.
(2) Proof that the taxpayer modified contracts of sale, or adopted a new contract of sale, to reflect the initiation, termination, or change in amount of the Federal excise tax, or at any such time changed the sale price of the article ( including the effect of a change in size, package, discount terms, or any other merchandising practice) by substantially the amount of the tax or change therein, or at any time billed the tax as a separate item to any vendee or indicated by any writing that the sale price included the amount of the tax, or contracted to refund any part
of the sale price in the event of recovery of the tax or decision of its invalidity ; but the taxpayer may establish that such acts were caused by factors other than the tax, or that they do not represent

A Federal excise tax shall be deemed to have been imposed with respect to an article if it was imposed with respect to (or with respect to the processing of) any commodity or other article, from which such article was processed .
(2) The term "date of the termination of the Federal excise tax" means, in the case of a Federal excise tax held invalid by a decision of the Supreme Court, the date of such decision.
(3) The term "refund or credit" does not include a refund or credit made in accordance with the provisions and limitations set forth in Title VII of the Revenue Act of 1936, 49 Stat. 1747, or in section 3443 (d ) .
(4) The term "tax adjustment" means a repayment or credit by the taxpayer to his vendee of an amount equal to the Federal excise tax with respect to an article (less reasonable expense to the vendor in connection with the nonpayment or recovery by him of the amount of such tax and in connection with the making of such repayment or credit) if such repayment or credit is made on or before June 1, 1936, or thereafter in the bona fide settlement of a written agreement entered into on or before March 3, 1936.
(5 ) The term "taxpayer" means a person subject to a tax imposed by this section.
(k) All references in this section to the purchase or sale (or to parties to the sale ) of articles with respect to which a Federal excise tax was imposed shall be deemed to include the purchase or sale (or parties to the sale) of services with respect to which a Federal excise tax was imposed, and for the purposes of subsection (a ) the extent to which the taxpayer shifted to others the burden of such Federal excise tax with respect to such services shall be presumed to be an amount computed as follows : From the selling price of the services there shall be deducted the average price received by the taxpayer for performing similar services during the six taxable years preceding the initial imposition of the Federal excise tax in question. The balance (to the extent that it does not exceed the amount of such Federal excise tax with respect to such services minus any payments or credits with respect to the services made to purchasers as specified in subsection ( f) ( 3 ) ) shall be the extent to which the taxpayer shifted the burden of such Federal excise tax to others. If during any part of such six-year period the taxpayer

116

CODIFICATION OF INTERNAL REVENUE LAWS

was not in business, or if his records for any part of such period are so inadequate as not to furnish satisfactory data, the average price of the taxpayer for such part of such period shall , when necessary for a fair comparison, be deemed to be the average price, as determined by the Commissioner, of representative concerns engaged in a similar business and similarly circumstanced . The presump-
tion established by this subsection may be rebutted by proof of the character described in subsection (i ) .
(1) The taxes imposed by subsection (a ) shall be imposed on the net income from the sources specified therein, regardless of any loss arising from the other transactions of the taxpayer, and regardless of whether the taxpayer had a taxable net income (under the income-tax provisions of the applicable Revenue Act) for the taxable year as a whole ; except that if such application of the tax imposed. by subsection (a) is held invalid , the tax under subsection (a ) shall apply to that portion of the taxpayer's entire net income for the taxable year which is attributable to the net income from the sources specified in such subsection .
SEC. 701. CREDIT FOR OTHER TAXES ON INCOME.
There shall be credited against the total amount of the taxes imposed by this subchapter an amount equivalent to the excess of--
(a ) The amount of the other Federal income and excess-profits taxes payable by the taxpayer for the taxable year, over
(b) The amount of the other Federal income and excess-profits taxes which would have been payable by the taxpayer for the taxable year if his net income were decreased by the amount of net income taxable under this subchapter. SEC. 702. ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS.
(a) All provisions of law (including penalties) applicable with respect to taxes imposed by chapter 1, shall, insofar as not inconsistent
with this subchapter, be applicable with respect to the taxes imposed. by this subchapter, except that the provisions of sections 101, 131, 251 , and 252 shall not be applicable.

(c ) If the Commissioner finds that the payment, on the date prescribed for the payment thereof, of any part of the amount determined by the taxpayer as the tax under this subchapter, or of any deficiency with respect thereto, would impose undue hardship upon the taxpayer, the Commissioner may grant an extension for the payment of any such part for a period not in excess of three years. În such case the amount with respect to which the extension is granted shall be paid on or before the date of the expiration of the period of the extension, and the running of the statute of limitations for assessment and collection shall be suspended for the period of any such extension. If an extension is granted, the Commissioner may require the taxpayer to furnish a bond in such amount, not exceeding double the amount with respect to which the extension is granted, and with such sureties as the Commissioner deems necessary, conditioned upon the payment of the amount with respect to which the extension is granted in accordance with the terms of the extension. There shall be collected, as a part of any amount with respect to which an extension is granted, interest thereon at the rate of 6 per centum per annum from the expiration of six months after the due date thereof to the expiration of the period of the extension.

adjustment for any difference in value (not due to mere lapse of time or the occurrence or nonoccurrence of a contingency) of the property as of the date one year after the decedent's death (substituting the date of sale or exchange in the case of property sold or exchanged during such one-year period ) .

(a) EXEMPTION.-An exemption of $100,000 ; b) EXPENSES, LOSSES, INDEBTEDNESS, AND TAXES. - Such amounts(1) for funeral expenses, (2) for administration expenses , (3) for claims against the estate,

(5) reasonably required and actually expended for the support during the settlement of the estate of those dependent upon the decedent,
as are allowed by the laws of the jurisdiction , whether within or without the United States, under which the estate is being administered , but not including any income taxes upon income received after the death of the decedent, or property taxes not accrued before his death, or any estate, succession, legacy, or inheritance taxes. The deduction herein allowed in the case of claims against the estate, unpaid mort-
gages, or any indebtedness shall, when founded upon a promise or agreement, be limited to the extent that they were contracted bona fide and for an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth. There shall also be deducted losses incurred during the settlement of estates arising from fires, storms, shipwrecks, or other casualties, or from theft, when such losses are not compensated for by insurance or

124

CODIFICATION OF INTERNAL REVENUE LAWS

otherwise, and if at the time of the filing of the return such losses have not been claimed as a deduction for income tax purposes in an income tax return.
For the purposes of this subchapter, a relinquishment or promised relinquishment of dower, curtesy, or of a statutory estate created in lieu of dower or curtesy, or of other marital rights in the decedent's property or estate, shall not be considered to any extent a consideration "in money or money's worth."
(c) PROPERTY PREVIOUSLY TAXED.-An amount equal to the value of any property (A) forming a part of the gross estate situated in the United States of any person who died within five years prior to the death of the decedent, or (B) transferred to the decedent by gift within five years prior to his death, where such property can be identified as having been received by the decedent from the donor by gift, or from such prior decedent by gift, bequest, devise, or inheritance, or which can be identified as having been acquired in exchange for property so received . This deduction shall be allowed only where a gift tax imposed under chapter 4, or an estate tax imposed under this subchapter, the Revenue Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 69, or any prior Act of Congress, was finally determined and paid by or on behalf of such donor, or the estate of such prior decedent, as the case may be, and only in the amount finally determined as the value of such
property in determining the value of the gift, or the gross estate of such prior decedent, and only to the extent that the value of such
property is included in the decedent's gross estate, and only if in determining the value of the net estate of the prior decedent no deduction was allowable under this paragraph in respect of the property or property given in exchange therefor.
Where a deduction was allowed of any mortgage or other lien in determining the gift tax, or the estate tax of the prior decedent, which was paid in whole or in part prior to the decedent's death, then the deduction allowable under this paragraph shall be reduced by the amount so paid. The deduction allowable under this subsection shall be reduced by an amount which bears the same ratio to the amounts allowed as deductions under subsections (a ) , ( b) and (d ) as the amount otherwise deductible under this subsection bears to the value
of the decedent's gross estate. Where the property referred to in this subsection consists of two or more items the aggregate value of such items shall be used for the purpose of computing the deduction.
(d) TRANSFERS FOR PUBLIC, CHARITABLE, AND RELIGIOUS USES.- The amount of all bequests, legacies, devises, or transfers, to or for the use of the United States, any State, Territory, any political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia, for exclusively public purposes, or to or for the use of any corporation organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational purposes, including the encouragement of art and the prevention of cruelty to children or animals, no part of the net earnings of which inures to the benefit of any private stockholder or individual, and no substantial part of the activities of which is carrying on propaganda, or otherwise attempting, to influence legislation, or to a trustee or trustees, or a fraternal society, order, or association operating under the lodge system, but only if such contributions or gifts are to be used by such trustee or trustees, or by such fraternal society, order, or association, exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational purposes, or for the prevention of cruelty to children or animals. If the tax imposed by section 810, or any
estate, succession, legacy, or inheritance taxes, are, either by the terms of the will, by the law of the jurisdiction under which the estate is administered, or by the law of the jurisdiction imposing the particular tax, payable in whole or in part out of the bequests, legacies, or devises otherwise deductible under this paragraph, then the amount deductible under this paragraph shall be the amount of such be-

ESTATE TAX

125

to the gift or gifts required to be so included shall be that proportion of the entire tax paid on account of all such gifts which the amount of the gift or gifts required to be so included bears to the total amount of gifts in that year.
(2) REVENUE ACT OF 1932.-- (A) If a tax has been paid under chapter 4 on a gift, and
thereafter upon the death of the donor any amount in respect

exceed an amount which bears the same ratio to the tax imposed by section 810 as the value (at the time of the gift or at the time of the death, whichever is lower) of so much of the property which constituted the gift as is included in the gross estate, bears to the value of the entire gross estate.
(B) For the purposes of paragraph (A) , the amount of tax paid for any year under chapter 4 with respect to any property shall be an amount which bears the same ratio to the total tax
paid for such year as the value of such property bears to the total amount of net gifts (computed without deduction of the specific exemption) for such year.

then the transferee, trustee, or beneficiary shall be personally liable for such tax, and such property, to the extent of the decedent's interest therein at the time of such transfer, or to the extent of such beneficiary's interest under such contract of insurance, shall be subject to a like lien equal to the amount of such tax. Any part of such prop-
erty sold by such transferee or trustee to a bona fide purchaser for an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth shall be divested of the lien and a like lien shall then attach to all the
property of such transferee or trustee, except any part sold to a bona fide purchaser for an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth.
(c) CONTINUANCE AFTER DISCHARGE OF EXECUTOR.- The provisions of section 825 shall not operate as a release of any part of the gross estate from the lien for any deficiency that may thereafter be determined to be due, unless the title to such part of the gross estate has passed to a bona fide purchaser for value, in which case such part

The Commissioner may, at any time before the decision of the Board is rendered, abate such assessment, or any unpaid portion thereof, to the extent that he believes the assessment to be excessive in amount.

892 or 893 (b) (4) . If any portion of the jeopardy assessment is abated by the Commissioner before the decision of the Board is rendered, the bond shall, at the request of the taxpayer, be proportionately reduced.
(g) SAME FURTHER CONDITIONS .-If the bond is given before the executor has filed his petition with the Board under subsection (a) of section 871, the bond shall contain a further condition that if a petition is not filed within the period provided in such subsection, then the amount the collection of which is stayed by the bond will be paid on notice and demand at any time after the expiration of such period, together with interest thereon at the rate of 6 per centum per annum from the date of the jeopardy notice and demand to the date of notice and demand under this subsection.
(h) WAIVER OF STAY.-Upon the filing of the bond the collection of so much of the amount assessed as is covered by the bond shall be
stayed. The executor shall have the right to waive such stay at any time in respect of the whole or any part of the amount covered by the bond, and if as a result of such waiver any part of the amount covered by the bond is paid, then the bond shall, at the request of the executor, be proportionately reduced.

SEC. 1001. COMPUTATION OF TAX.
(a) The tax for each calendar year shall be an amount equal to the excess of-
(1) a tax, computed in accordance with the Rate Schedule hereinafter set forth, on the aggregate sum of the net gifts for such calendar year and for each of the preceding calendar years, over
(2) a tax, computed in accordance with the said Rate Schedule, on the aggregate sum of the net gifts for each of the preceding calendar years.

(2) If no amount is shown as the tax by the donor upon his return, or if no return is made by the donor, then the amount by which the tax exceeds the amounts previously assessed (or collected without assessment ) as a deficiency ; but such amounts previously assessed, or collected without assessment, shall first be decreased by the amounts previously abated , refunded . or otherwise repaid in respect of such tax.
SEC. 1012. ASSESSMENT AND COLLECTION OF DEFICIENCIES.

matical errors appearing upon the face of the return ; Section 1013, relating to jeopardy assessments ; Section 1015, relating to bankruptcy and receiverships ; and Section 1145, relating to assessment or collection of the amount of
the deficiency determined by the Board pending court review.
(b) COLLECTION OF DEFICIENCY FOUND BY BOARD.-If the donor files a petition with the Board, the entire amount redetermined as the deficiency by the decision of the Board which has become final shall be assessed and shall be paid upon notice and demand from the collector. No part of the amount determined as a deficiency by the Commissioner but disallowed as such by the decision of the Board which has become final shall be assessed or be collected by distraint or by proceeding in court with or without assessment.
(c) FAILURE TO FILE PETITION.-If the donor does not file a petition with the Board within the time prescribed in subsection (a) the deficiency, notice of which has been mailed to the donor, shall be assessed, and shall be paid upon notice and demand from the collector.

(e) INCREASE OF DEFICIENCY AFTER NOTICE MAILED.-The Board shall have jurisdiction to redetermine the correct amount of the deficiency even if the amount so redetermined is greater than the amount of the deficiency, notice of which has been mailed to the donor, and to determine whether any additional amount or addition to the tax should be assessed, if claim therefor is asserted by the Commissioner at or before the hearing or a rehearing.
(f) FURTHER DEFICIENCY LETTERS RESTRICTED.-If the Commissioner has mailed to the donor notice of a deficiency as provided in
subsection (a) of this section, and the donor files a petition with the Board within the time prescribed in such subsection, the Commissioner shall have no right to determine any additional deficiency in respect of the same calendar year, except in the case of fraud, and except as provided in subsection (e) of this section, relating to assertion of greater deficiencies before the Board, or in section 1013 ( c) , relating to the making of jeopardy assessments. If the donor is notified that, on account of a mathematical error appearing upon the
face of the return, an amount of tax in excess of that shown upon the return is due, and that an assessment of the tax has been or will be made on the basis of what would have been the correct amount of tax but for the mathematical error, such notice shall not be considered (for the purposes of this subsection, or of subsection (a ) of this sec-
tion, prohibiting assessment and collection until notice of deficiency has been mailed, or of section 1027 (c ) , prohibiting credits or refunds after petition to the Board of Tax Appeals) as a notice of a deficiency, and the donor shall have no right to file a petition with the Board based on such notice, nor shall such assessment or collection be prohibited by the provisions of subsection ( a ) of this section.
(g) JURISDICTION OVER OTHER CALENDAR YEARS.-The Board in redetermining a deficiency in respect of any calendar year shall consider such facts with relation to the taxes for other calendar years as may be necessary correctly to redetermine the amount of such
deficiency, but in so doing shall have_no_jurisdiction to determine whether or not the tax for any other calendar year has been overpaid or underpaid.

If an extension is granted, the Commissioner may require the donor to furnish a bond in such amount, not exceeding double the amount of the deficiency, and with such sureties, as the Commissioner deems necessary, conditioned upon the payment of the deficiency in accordance with the terms of the extension.
(j ) ADDRESS FOR NOTICE OF DEFICIENCY. -In the absence of notice to the Commissioner under section 1026 (a ) of the existence of a fiduciary relationship, notice of a deficiency in respect of a tax imposed by this chapter, if mailed to the donor at his last known address, shall be sufficient for the purposes of this chapter even if such donor is deceased, or is under a legal disability.

The Commissioner may, at any time before the decision of the Board is rendered, abate such assessment, or any unpaid portion thereof, to the extent that he believes the assessment to be excessive in amount. The Commissioner
shall notify the Board of the amount of such assessment, or abatement, if the petition is filed with the Board before the making of the assessment or is subsequently filed, and the Board shall have jurisdiction to redetermine the entire amount of the deficiency and of all amounts assessed at the same time in connection therewith.
(d ) AMOUNT ASSESSABLE AFTER DECISION OF BOARD.-If the jeopardy assessment is made after the decision of the Board is rendered such assessment may be made only in respect of the deficiency determined by the Board in its decision.

If any portion of the jeopardy assessment is abated by the Commissioner before the decision of the Board is rendered, the bond shall, at the request of the taxpayer, be proportionately reduced.
(g) SAME FURTHER CONDITIONS.-If the bond is given before the donor has filed his petition with the Board under section 1012 (a) , the bond shall contain a further condition that if a petition is not filed within the period provided in such subsection, then the amount the collection of which is stayed by the bond will be paid on notice and demand at any time after the expiration of such period , together with interest thereon at the rate of 6 per centum per annum from the date of the jeopardy notice and demand to the date of notice and demand under this subsection.
(h) WAIVER OF STAY.-Upon the filing of the bond the collection of so much of the amount assessed as is covered by the bond shall be stayed . The donor shall have the right to waive such stay at any time in respect of the whole or any part of the amount covered by the bond, and if as a result of such waiver any part of the amount covered by the bond is paid , then the bond shall, at the request of the donor, be proportionately reduced. If the Board determines that the amount assessed is greater than the amount which should have been assessed, then when the decision of the Board is rendered
the bond shall, at the request of the donor, be proportionately reduced .
(i) COLLECTION OF UNPAID AMOUNTS.-When the petition has been filed with the Board and when the amount which should have been
assessed has been determined by a decision of the Board which has become final, then any unpaid portion , the collection of which has been stayed by the bond, shall be collected as part of the tax upon notice and demand from the collector, and any remaining portion of the assessment shall be abated. If the amount already collected exceeds the amount determined as the amount which should have
been assessed, such excess shall be credited or refunded as provided in section 1027, without the filing of claim therefor. If the amount determined as the amount which should have been assessed is greater than the amount actually assessed , then the difference shall be assessed and shall be collected as part of the tax upon notice and demand from the collector.

In all surveys forty-five gallons of mash or beer brewed or fer-
mented from grain shall represent not less than one bushel of grain, and seven gallons of mash or beer brewed or fermented from molasses shall represent not less than one gallon of molasses , except in distil-

LIQUOR

A written report of such survey shall be made in triplicate, of which one copy shall be delivered to the distiller, one copy shall be retained by the collector, and one copy shall be transmitted to the Commissioner, and the survey shall take effect upon the delivery of such copy to the distiller.
Whenever the Commissioner is satisfied that any report of the capacity of a distillery is incorrect or needs revision, he shall direct the collector to make in like manner another survey of said distillery, and the report thereof shall be made and deposited as hereinbefore required :
Provided, That the survey of any distillery estimated and stated by the distiller, in his notice of intention to distill, as capable of distilling not more than one hundred and fifty proof gallons of distilled spirits every twenty-four hours may be made by the collector or by a
deputy collector without the aid of an assistant ; and that all surveys made for the purpose of correcting clerical errors or errors of computation existing in the report of a previous survey, and all surveys made for the purpose of changing the true spirit producing capacity of any distillery for a day of twenty-four hours as estimated and determined by a previous survey, but which surveys do not require the remeasuring of the fermenting tubs in a grain or molasses distillery, or the still or stills in a distillery of apples, peaches, or grapes exclusively, may be made without taking the measurements of the fermenting tubs or stills, as the case may be, and without revisiting the distillery :
And provided further, That the Commissioner may, whenever he shall deem it proper, designate an officer, agent, or person other than the collector or deputy collector, to make, with or without the aid of a designated assistant, the surveys and resurveys hereinabove provided for.
(b) WAIVER OF REQUIREMENTS .-The Secretary in the case of any distillery may, under regulations, waive such of the requirements of this section as he determines may be waived without danger to the revenue.

beneficiary ; (D) fiduciary and beneficiary, legatee, or heir ; (E) decedent and decedent's estate ; or ( F) partner.

(2 ) Allows a deduction or credit which was erroneously allowed to the taxpayer for another taxable year or to a related taxpayer ; or
(3) Requires the exclusion from gross income of an item with respect to which tax was paid and which was erroneously excluded or omitted from the gross income of the taxpayer for another taxable year or from the gross income of a related taxpayer ; or
(4) Allows or disallows any of the additional deductions allowable in computing the net income of estates or trusts, or requires or denies any of the inclusions in the computation of net income of beneficiaries , heirs, or legatees, specified in section 162 (b) and (c) of chapter 1, and corresponding sections of prior revenue Acts, and the correlative inclusion or deduction, as the case may be, has been erroneously excluded, omitted, or included, or disallowed, omitted, or allowed, as the case may be, in respect of the related taxpayer ; or

to compromises) , then the effect of the error shall be corrected by an adjustment made under this section . Such adjustment shall be made only if there is adopted in the determination a position maintained by the Commissioner (in case the amount of the adjustment would be refunded or credited in the same manner as an overpayment under subsection (c ) ) or by the taxpayer with respect to whom the determination is made (in case the amount of the adjustment would be assessed and collected in the same manner as a deficiency under subsection ( c ) ) , which position is inconsistent with the erroneous inclusion , exclusion, omission, allowance, disallowance, recognition, or nonrecognition, as the case may be. In case the amount of the adjustment would be assessed and collected in the same manner as a deficiency, the adjustment shall not be made with respect to a related taxpayer unless he stands in such relationship to the taxpayer at the time the latter first maintains the inconsistent position in a return, claim for refund, or petition (or amended petition) to the Board of Tax Appeals for the taxable year with respect to which the determination is made, or if such position is not so maintained, then at the time of the determination.
(c) METHOD OF ADJUSTMENT.-The adjustment authorized in subsection (b) shall be made by assessing and collecting, or refunding or crediting, the amount thereof, to be ascertained as provided in subsection (d) , in the same manner as if it were a deficiency determined by the Commissioner with respect to the taxpayer as to whom the

MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

473

error was made or an overpayment claimed by such taxpayer, as the case may be, for the taxable year with respect to which the error was made, and as if on the date of the determination specified in subsection (b) one year remained before the expiration of the periods of limitation upon assessment or filing claim for refund for such taxable year.
(d) ASCERTAINMENT OF AMOUNT OF ADJUSTMENT.-In computing the amount of an adjustment under this section there shall first be ascertained the tax previously determined for the taxable year with respect to which the error was made. The amount of the tax previously determined shall be ( 1 ) the tax shown by the taxpayer, with respect to whom the error was made, upon his return for such taxable year, increased by the amounts previously assessed ( or collected without assessment) as deficiencies, and decreased by the amounts previously abated, credited , refunded, or otherwise repaid in respect of such tax ; or (2 ) if no amount was shown as the tax by such taxpayer upon his return, or if no return was made by such taxpayer, then the amounts previously assessed (or collected without assessment) as deficiencies, but such amounts previously assessed, or collected without assessment, shall be decreased by the amounts previously abated, credited , refunded, or otherwise repaid in respect of such tax. There shall then be ascertained the increase or decrease
in the tax previously determined which results solely from the correct exclusion, inclusion, allowance, disallowance, recognition, or nonrecognition, of the item, inclusion, deduction, credit, gain, or loss, which was the subject of the error. The amount so ascertained ( together with any amounts wrongfully collected, as additions to the tax or interest, as a result of such error) shall be the amount of the adjustment under this section.
(e ) ADJUSTMENT UNAFFECTED BY OTHER ITEMS , ETC.-The amount to be assessed and collected in the same manner as a deficiency, or to be refunded or credited in the same manner as an overpayment,
under this section, shall not be diminished by any credit or set-off based upon any item, inclusion, deduction, credit, exemption, gain, or loss other than the one which was the subject of the error. Such amount, if paid, shall not be recovered by a claim or suit for refund or suit for erroneous refund based upon any item, inclusion , deduction, credit, exemption, gain, or loss other than the one which was the subject of the error.
(f) NO ADJUSTMENT FOR YEARS PRIOR TO 1932.- No adjustment shall be made under this section in respect of any taxable year beginning prior to January 1, 1932. SEC. 3802. SEPARABILITY CLAUSE.
If any provision of this title, or the application thereof to any person or circumstances, is held invalid, the remainder of the title, and the application of such provisions to other persons or circumstances, shall not be affected thereby.

Part III -Miscellaneous Statutory or Treaty Provisions

This part contains miscellaneous statutory or treaty provisions affecting the administration of internal revenue laws, but omitted from the Internal Revenue Code for the reason that they are of a temporary nature or do not relate exclusively to internal revenue.
The provisions are arranged, so far as practicable, in the exact sequence, Title and section, of the provisions of the United States
Code based thereon, the Code citation being given at the bottom of each provision. Where it has seemed desirable, for any reason, to
deviate from the exact sequence of the Code, the modified plan of arrangement is explained under the particular heading.

TITLE 1- GENERAL PROVISIONS

Whenever an act is repealed, which repealed a former act, such former act shall not thereby be revived, unless it shall be expressly so provided. (R. S. § 12. ) ( U. S. C., Title 1, § 28. )
The repeal of any statute shall not have the effect to release or extinguish any penalty, forfeiture, or liability incurred under such statute, unless the
repealing act shall so expressly provide, and such statute shall be treated as still remaining in force for the purpose of sustaining any proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of such penalty, forfeiture, or liability. (R. S. § 13.) (U. S. C., Title 1, § 29. )

TITLE 5- EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND GOVERNMENT OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES

OATH OF OFFICE

Whenever any person

* * is elected or appointed to any office of honor

or trust under the Government of the United States, * * * he shall, before

entering upon the duties of his office, take and subscribe ** * * the follow-

ing oath : "I, A B, do solemnly swear ( or affirm) that I will support and de fend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic ; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same ; that I take

this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion, and
that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God." (R. S. § 1757.) (U. S. C., Title 5, § 16. )

OATH NEED NOT BE RENEWED

Civilian employees of the executive departments and independent establishments of the United States who, upon original appointment, have subscribed to the oath of office required by section 1757 of the Revised Statutes, shall not be required to renew the said oath because of any change in status so long as their services are continuous in the department or independent establishment in which employed, unless in the opinion of the head of the department or independent establishment the public interests require such renewal. ( Aug. 14, 1937, c. 624, 50 Stat. 640. ) ( U. S. C. , Title 5, § 17 ( b) . )
WHO MAY ADMINISTER OATH

The oath of office required by either of the two preceding sections may be taken before any officer who is authorized either by the laws of the United States, or by the local municipal law, to administer oaths, in the State, Territory, or District where such oath may be administered. ( R. S. § 1758. ) (U. S. C., Title 5, § 18. )

that any class of products of any commodity is of such low value, considering the quantity of the commodity used for their manufacture, that the imposition

of the processing tax would prevent in whole or in large part the use of the

commodity in the manufacture of such products and thereby substantially

reduce consumption and increase the surplus of the commodity, then the Secre-

tary of Agriculture shall so certify to the Secretary of the Treasury, specifying

whether such result will in his judgment most effectively be prevented by a suspension of the imposition of the processing tax or a refund of the tax paid,

with respect to such amount of the commodity or any product thereof as is

used in the manufacture of such products, and thereafter, as shall be specified

in such certification, ( 1 ) the imposition of the processing tax shall be suspended

with respect to such amount of the commodity as is used in the manufacture

of such products, and thereafter, as shall be specified in such certification,

(2) the imposition of the processing tax shall be suspended with respect to

such amount of the commodity as is used in the manufacture of such products

until such time as the Secretary of Agriculture, after further investigation and due notice and opportunity for hearing to interested parties, revokes his

certification to the Secretary of the Treasury, or (3) the Secretary of the Treasury shall refund (in accordance with the provisions of, to such persons

and in such manner as shall be specified in, such certification ) the amount of

any tax paid (prior to the date of any revocation by the Secretary of Agri-

culture of his certification to the Secretary of the Treasury, upon further

investigation and after due notice and opportunity for hearing to interested

parties ) under this title with respect to such amount of the commodity or any product thereof as is used after the date of such certification in the manufac-

ture of such products, or shall credit against any tax due and payable under

this title the amount of tax which would be refundable. During the period in

which any certificate under this section is effective, the provisions of subsection (e ) of this section shall be suspended with respect to all imported articles of the kind described in such certificate ; and notwithstanding the

provisions of section 21, any compensating taxes, which have heretofore, during

the period in which any certificate under this section has been effective, become due and payable upon imported articles of the kind described in such

certificate, shall be refunded by the Secretary of the Treasury if the same have

been paid, or, if the same have not been paid the amount thereof shall be

abated. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 21, the Secretary of the

Treasury shall refund or credit any processing tax paid on or before June 12, 1934, with respect to such amount of cotton as was used in the manufacture

of large cotton bags ( as defined in the Certificate of the Secretary of Agri-

culture, dated June 12, 1934) between June 13 and July 7, 1934, both

Upon the filing of any such petition, the claimant shall be entitled to a hearing as provided herein, and within three months after the date of such filing the Board shall set a date for such hearing which shall be not more than two years from the date of filing of the petition. Such hearing shall be held in Washington, District of Columbia, or in the collection district in which

time is extended by the Board or such division. Except upon specific order of

the chairman of the Board, no oral argument may be presented to the Board or such division after the conclusion of the hearing. The Board or a division shall make its findings of fact and decision in writing as quickly as practicable.

The findings of fact and the decision of a division shall become the findings of fact and decision of the Board within thirty days after they have been made by

the division, unless within such period, the chairman has directed that such

findings and decision shall be reviewed by the Board. The findings and decision of a division shall not be a part of the record in any case in which the chair-

rules and regulations as may be prescribed by the Board, with the approval of

the Secretary. If the hearing provided herein results in a modification of the

allowance or disallowance of the Commissioner, such costs shall be returned

court shall have exclusive jurisdiction to affirm the decision of the Board, or to modify or reverse such decision, if it is not in accordance with law, with or without remanding the cause for a rehearing, as justice may require. No objection shall be considered by the court unless such objection shall have been urged before the Board or division and the presiding officer, or unless there were reasonable grounds for failure so to do. If the claimant or the Commissioner shall apply to the court for leave to adduce additional evidence and shall show to the satisfaction of the court that such additional evidence is material, and that there were reasonable grounds for failure to adduce such evidence in the hearing before the presiding officer, the court may order such additional evidence to be taken before such officer, and to be adduced upon the hearing in such manner and upon such terms and conditions as to the court may seem proper. The Board may modify its findings of fact and decision by reason of the additional evidence so taken and it shall file with the court such modified or new findings and decision. The judgment of the court shall be final, subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United States, upon certification or certiorari as provided in sections 239 and 240 of the Judicial Code, as amended. Such courts are authorized to adopt rules for the filing of petitions for review, the preparation of the record for review, and the conduct of the proceedings on review. If the decision of the Board is affirmed, costs shall be awarded against the claimant, and if such decision is reversed , the judgment shall provide for a refund of any costs paid by the claimant. In case of modification of such
decision costs shall be awarded or refused as justice may require. The decision of the Board made after the hearing provided herein shall become final in the same manner that decisions of the Board of Tax Appeals become final under section 1005 of the Revenue Act of 1926, as amended. (U. S. C., Title 7, § 648. )
SEC. 907. EVIDENCE AND PRESUMPTIONS
(a) Where the refund claimed is for an amount paid or collected as processing tax, as defined herein, it shall be prima-facie evidence that the burden of such amount was borne by the claimant to the extent (not to exceed the amount of the tax) that the average margin per unit of the commodity processed was lower during the tax period than the average margin was during the period before and after the tax. If the average margin during the tax period was not lower, it shall be prima-facie evidence that none of the burden of such amount was borne by the claimant but that it was shifted to others.
(b) The average margin for the tax period and the average margin for the period before and after the tax shall each be determined as follows :"
(1 ) TAX PERIOD. -The average margin for the tax period shall be the average of the margins for all months ( or portions of months) within the tax period. The margin for each such month shall be computed as follows : From the gross sales value of all articles processed by the claimant from the commodity during such month, deduct the cost of the commodity processed during the month and deduct the processing tax paid with respect thereto. The sum so ascertained shall be divided by the total number of units of the commodity processed during such month, and the resulting figure shall be the margin for the month.
(2) PERIOD BEFORE AND AFTER THE TAX.-The average margin for the period before and after the tax shall be the average of the margins for all months (or portions of months) within the period before and after the tax. The
margin for each such month shall be computed as follows : From the gross sales value of all articles processed by the claimant from the commodity during such month, deduct the cost of the commodity processed during the month. The sum so ascertained shall be divided by the number of units of the commodity processed during such month, and the resulting figure shall be the margin for the month.
(3) AVERAGE MARGIN.- The average margin for each period shall be ascertained in the same manner as monthly margins under subdivisions (1 ) and (2 ) , using total gross sales value, total cost of commodity processed, total processing tax paid, and total units of commodity processed, during such period.
(4) COMBINATION OF COMMODITIES.-Where, as, for example, in the case of certain types of tobacco, the articles produced and sold by the claimant are the product of several commodities combined by him during processing, the average margins shall be established with respect to such commodities as a group, and not individually, in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the Commissioner, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury.
(5) COST OF COMMODITY.-The cost of commodity processed during each month shall be ( a ) the actual cost of the commodity processed if the accounting procedure of the claimant is based thereon, or ( b ) the product computed by multiplying the quantity of the commodity processed by the current prices at the time of processing for commodities of like quality and grade in the markets where the claimant customarily makes his purchases.

CODIFICATION OF INTERNAL REVENUE LAWS
(6) GROSS SALES VALUE OF ARTICLES.-The gross sales value of articles shall mean (a) the total of the quantity of each article derived from the commodity processed by the claimant during each month multiplied by (b) the claimant's sale prices current at the time of processing for articles of similar grade and quality.
(7) The quantity of each article derived from the commodity processed may be either (a) the actual quantity obtained, as shown by the records of
the claimant, or (b) an estimated quantity computed by multiplying the quantity of commodity processed by appropriate conversion factors giving the quantity of articles customarily obtained from the processing of each unit of the commodity.
(c) The "tax period" shall mean the period with respect to which the claimant actually paid the processing tax to a collector of internal revenue and shall end on the date with respect to which the last payment was made. The "period before and after the tax" shall mean the twenty-four months ( except that in the case of tobacco it shall be the twelve months) immediately preceding the effective date of the processing tax, and the six months, February to July, 1936, inclusive. If during any part of such period the claimant was not in business, or if his records for any part of such period are so inadequate as not to provide satisfactory data on prices paid for commodities purchased or prices received for articles sold, the average prices paid or received by representative concerns engaged in a similar business and similarly circumstanced may with the approval of the Commissioner, where necessary for a fair comparison, be substituted in making the necessary computations. If the claimant was not in business during the entire period before and after the tax, the aver-
age margin, during such period, of representative concerns engaged in a similar business and similarly circumstanced, as determined by the Commissioner, shall be used as his average margin for such period.
(d) If the claimant made any purchase or sale otherwise than through an arm's-length transaction, and at a price other than the fair market price, the Commissioner may determine the purchase or sale price to be that for which such purchases or sales were at that time made in the ordinary course of trade.
(e) Either the claimant or the Commissioner may rebut the presumption established by subsection (a ) of this section by proof of the actual extent to which the claimant shifted to others the burden of the processing tax. Such proof may include, but shall not be limited to-
(1) Proof that the difference or lack of difference between the average margin for the tax period and the average margin for the period before and after the tax was due to changes in factors other than the tax. Such factors shall include any clearly shown change (A) in the type or grade of article or commodity, or (B) in costs of production. If the claimant asserts that the burden of the tax was borne by him and the burden of any other increased costs was shifted to others, the Commissioner shall determine, from the effective dates of the imposition or termination of the tax and the effective date of other changes in costs as compared with the date of the changes in margin (when margins are computed for weeks, months, or other intervals between July 1, 1931, and August, 1936, in the manner specified in subsection (b ) ) , and from the general experience of the industry, whether the tax or the increase in other costs was shifted to others. If the Commissioner determines that the difference in average margin was due in part to the tax and in part to the increase in other costs, he shall apportion the change in margin between them ;
(2) Proof that the claimant modified existing contracts of sale, or adopted a new form of contract of sale, to reflect the initiation, termination, or change in amount of the processing tax, or at any such time changed the sale price of the article ( including the effect of a change in size, package, discount terms, or any other merchandising practice ) by substantially the amount of the tax or change therein, or at any time billed the tax as a separate item to any vendee, or indicated by any writing that the sale price included the amount of the tax, or contracted to refund any part of the sale price in the event of recovery of the tax or decision of its invalidity ; but the claimant may establish that such acts were caused by factors other than the processing tax, or that they do not represent his practice at other times. If the claimant processed any product in addition to the commodity with respect to the processing of which there was paid or collected an amount as tax for which he claims a refund, and if the Commissioner has reason to believe that the burden of such amount was shifted in whole or in part by means of the transactions relating to such product, the average margin with respect to such product, and articles processed therefrom, shall also be considered, and shall be determined for the tax period applicable to the commodity and for the period before and after the tax in the manner prescribed in subsection (b) of this section. To the extent the Commissioner determines that the average

APPENDIX

CI

margin with respect to such product was higher during the tax period than it was during the period before and after the tax, it shall be prima-facie evidence that such amount was not borne by the claimant but that it was shifted to others. (U. S. C., Title 7, § 649. )
SEC. 908. LIMITATIONS ON ALLOWANCE OF CLAIMS AND INTEREST
(a) No claim shall be allowed under this title in an amount less than $10. (b) No interest shall be allowed by the Commissioner or by any court with respect to any amount paid or collected as tax under the Agricultural Adjustment Act, except with respect to amounts, refund of which is made or allowed under this title.

SEC. 910. LIABILITY OF COLLECTORS

( U. S. C., Title 7. § 652. )
SEC. 911. INAPPLICABILITY TO CERTAIN REFUNDS
The provisions of this title shall not apply to any refund authorized under the provisions of sections 15, 16, or 17 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended and reenacted, or with respect to any articles exported under the provisions of section 317 of the Tariff Act of 1930. No refund shall be made or allowed of any amount paid or collected as tax under the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended and reenacted, to the extent that refund or credit with respect to such amount has been made to any person. (U. S. C., Title 7, § 653. )
SEC. 912. PERIOD NOT EXTENDED
Any suit or proceeding with respect to any amount paid or collected as tax under the Agricultural Adjustment Act which is barred on the date of enactment of this Act shall remain barred. No claim with respect to any such amount which is barred from allowance at the time of the enactment of this Act shall hereafter be allowed in any amount. (U. S. C. , Title 7, § 654.)

CVII

SEC. 144. If an answer filed by any creditor, indenture trustee, or stockholder shall controvert any of the material allegations of the petition, the judge shall, as soon as may be, determine, without the intervention of a jury, the issues presented by the pleadings and enter an order approving the petition, if satisfied that it complies with the requirements of this chapter and has been filed in good faith and that the material allegations are sustained by the proofs, or dismissing it if not so satisfied.
SEC. 145. If any issue raised in an answer filed under section 136 or 137 of this Act has, after hearing upon notice to the debtor, creditors, indenture trustees, and stockholders entitled to controvert the allegations of the petition, already been tried and finally determined under the provisions of section 143 or 144 of this Act, such final determination shall be conclusive for all purposes under this chapter.
SEC. 146. Without limiting the generality of the meaning of the term "good faith," a petition shall be deemed not to be filed in good faith if--
(1) the petitioning creditors have acquired their claims for the purpose of filing the petition ; or
(2) adequate relief would be obtainable by a debtor's petition under the provisions of chapter XI of this Act ; or

A petition filed under this chapter improperly because adequate relief can be obtained by the debtor under chapter XI of this Act may, upon the application of the debtor, be amended to comply with the requirements of chapter XI for the filing of a debtor's petition, and shall thereafter for the purposes of chapter XI be deemed to have been originally filed thereunder. SEC. 148.

SEC. 149. An order, which has become final, approving a petition filed under this chapter shall be a conclusive determination of the jurisdiction of the court.

SEC. 156. Upon the approval of a petition, the judge shall, if the indebtedness of a debtor, liquidated as to amount and not contingent as to liability, is $250,000 or over, appoint one or more trustees.

SEC. 159. Where the indebtedness of a debtor is less than $250,000, the judge may at any time terminate the appointment of a trustee and restore the debtor to the possession of its property, or, if the debtor has been continued in possession, terminate its possession and appoint a trustee. SEO. 160. In any case, the judge at any time, without or upon cause shown, may appoint additional trustees or remove trustees and appoint substitute trustees . SEC. 161.

SEC. 165. If in any case it appears that a person, other than the debtor or its trustee, has in his possession or under his control a list of security holders of the debtor or information in respect to their names, addresses, or the securities held by any of them, and such list or information is necessary in order to disclose the names and addresses of the beneficial owners of such securities, or to prepare or complete the schedules required to be filed under section 163 of this Act or the lists required to be filed under section 164 of this Act, the court shall direct such person, after a hearing upon notice to him, to produce such list or a true and correct copy thereof, or to furnish such information, or to permit the inspection or use thereof, as may be deemed by the court necessary for the foregoing purposes.
SEC. 166. The court may, upon cause shown, direct the impounding of the schedules, lists, copies, or information filed under sections 163, 164, and 165 of this Act, but shall permit their inspection or use by the trustee, any indenture trustee or any creditor or stockholder upon such terms as the court may prescribe : Provided, That the court may refuse to permit such inspection by any creditor or stockholder who acquired his claim or stock within three months preceding the filing of the petition under this chapter or during the pendency of the proceeding.

(6) shall give notice to the creditors and stockholders that they may submit to him suggestions for the formulation of a plan, or proposals in the form of plans, within a time therein named.

SEC. 213. Without limiting the powers of the judge under section 212 of this Act, an agent, indenture trustee, or committee, purporting to represent creditors or stockholders, shall not be heard or allowed to intervene in a proceeding under this chapter until such person or persons shall have satisfied the court that they have complied with all applicable laws regulating the activities and personnel of such persons.

CXLV

Any producer believing that any commerce in coal is not subject to the provisions of section 4 or to the provisions of the first paragraph of this section may file with the Commission an application, verified by oath or affirmation for exemption, setting forth the facts upon which such claim is based. The filing of such application in good faith shall exempt the applicant, beginning with the third day following the filing of the application, from any obligation, duty, or liability imposed by section 4 with respect to the commerce covered by the application until such time as the Commission shall act upon the application. If the Commission has reason to believe that such exemption during the period prior to action upon the application is likely to permit evasion of the Act with respect to commerce in coal properly subject to the provisions of section 4 or of the first paragraph of this section, it may suspend the exemption for a period not to exceed ten days. Within a reasonable time after the receipt of any application for exemption the Commission shall enter an order granting, or, after notice and opportunity for hearing, denying or otherwise disposing of such application. As a condition to the entry of and as a part of any order granting such application, the Commission may require the applicant to apply periodically for renewals of such order and to file such periodic reports as the Commission may find necessary or appropriate to enable it to determine whether the conditions supporting the exemption continue to exist. Any applicant aggrieved by an order denying or otherwise disposing of an application for exemption by the Commission may obtain a review of such order in the manner provided in subsection ( b) of section 6. ( U. S. C., Title 15, § 834. )

The Commission shall keep a record of the evidence heard by it in any proceeding to cancel or revoke the membership of any code member and its findings of fact, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive upon any proceeding to review the action and order of the Commission in any court of the United States.
In making an order revoking membership in the code as in this subsection provided, the Commission shall specifically find (1 ) the day or days on which the violations occurred ; (2 ) the quantity of coal sold or otherwise disposed of in violation of the code or regulations thereunder ; ( 3 ) the sales price at the mine or the market value at the mine if disposed of otherwise than by sale at the mine, or if sold otherwise than through an arms' length transaction, of the coal sold or otherwise disposed of by such code member in violation of the code or regulations thereunder ; ( 4 ) the minimum price established by the Commission for such coal and in effect at the time of such sale or other dis-

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
A PROCLAMATION
WHEREAS the Congress of the United States in second session of the Seventysecond Congress, begun at Washington on the fifth day of December in the year one thousand nine hundred and thirty-two, adopted a resolution in the words and figures following, to wit :
"JOINT RESOLUTION
Proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States. "Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled ( two-thirds of each House concurring therein) , That the following article is hereby proposed as an amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which shall be valid to all intents and purposes as part of the Constitution when ratified by conventions in three-fourths of the several States :

"Article
""Section 1. The eighteenth article of amendment to the Constitution of the Un6i6ted States is hereby repealed .
' Sec. 2. The transportation or importation into any State, Territory, or possession of the United States for delivery or use therein of intoxicating liquors, in violation of the laws thereof, is hereby prohibited.
" Sec. 3. This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by conventions in the several States, as provided in the Constitution, within seven years from the date of the submission hereof to the States by the Congress." "
WHEREAS Section 217 (a ) of the act of Congress entitled "AN ACT To encourage national industrial recovery, to foster competition, and to provide for the construction of certain useful public works, and for other purposes", approved June 16, 1933, provides as follows :
"Sec. 217. (a) The President shall proclaim the date of(1) the close of the first fiscal year ending June 30 of any year after the
year 1933, during which the total receipts of the United States (excluding public-debt receipts ) exceed its total expenditures (excluding public-debt expenditures other than those chargeable against such receipts ) , or
(2 ) the repeal of the eighteenth amendment to the Constitution, whichever is the earlier."
WHEREAS it appears from a certificate issued December 5, 1933, by the Acting Secretary of State that official notices have been received in the Department of State that on the fifth day of December 1933 conventions in 36 States of the United States, constituting three fourths of the whole number of the States had ratified the said repeal amendment ;
NOW, THEREFORE, I, FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT, President of the United States of America, pursuant to the provisions of section 217 (a ) of the said act of June 16, 1933, do hereby proclaim that the eighteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United States was repealed on the fifth day of December 1933.
FURTHERMORE, I enjoin upon all citizens of the United States and upon others resident within the jurisdiction thereof to cooperate with the Government in its endeavor to restore greater respect for law and order, by confining such purchases of alcoholic beverages as they may make solely to those dealers or agenIcies which have been duly licensed by State or Federal license.
Observance of this request, which I make personally to every individual and every family in our Nation, will result in the consumption of alcoholic beverages which have passed Federal inspection, in the break-up and eventual destruction of the notoriously evil illicit liquor traffic, and in the payment of reasonable taxes for the support of Government and thereby in the superseding of other forms of taxation.
I call specific attention to the authority given by the twenty-first amendment to the Government to prohibit transportation or importation of intoxicating liquors into any State in violation of the laws of such State.
I ask the whole-hearted cooperation of all our citizens to the end that this return of individual freedom shall not be accompanied by the repugnant conditions that obtained prior to the adoption of the eighteenth amendment and those that have existed since its adoption. Failure to do this honestly and courageously will be a living reproach to us all.
I ask especially that no State shall by law or otherwise authorize the return of the saloon either in its old form or in some modern guise.
The policy of the Government will be to see to it that the social and political evils that have existed in the pre-prohibition era shall not be revived nor permitted again to exist. We must remove forever from our midst the menace of the bootlegger and such others as would profit at the expense of good government, law, and order.
I trust in the good sense of the American people that they will not bring upon themselves the curse of excessive use of intoxicating liquors, to the detriment of health, morals, and social integrity.
The objective we seek through a national policy is the education of every citizen towards a greater temperance throughout the Nation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this fifth day of December, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and thirty-three, and of the Independence
[SEAL ] of the United States of America the one hundred and fifty-eighth. FRANKLIN D ROOSEVELT

after affording such notice and opportunity for hearing, finds that the applicant is not entitled to a basic permit hereunder, he shall by order deny the application stating the findings which are the basis for his order.

matically terminated thereupon, and (2) if transferred by operation of law or if actual or legal control of the permittee is acquired , directly or indirectly, whether by stock-ownership or in any other manner, by any person, then such permit shall be automatically terminated at the expiration of thirty days thereafter : Provided, That if within such thirty-day period application for a new basic permit is made by the transferee or permittee, respectively, then the
outstanding basic permit shall continue in effect until such application is finally acted on by the Administrator.

A copy of such petition shall be forthwith served upon the Administrator, or upon any officer designated by him for that purpose, and thereupon the Administrator shall certify and file in the court a transcript of the record upon which the order complained of was entered. Upon the filing of such transcript such court shall have exclusive jurisdiction to affirm, modify, or set aside such order, in whole or in part. No objection to the order of the Administrator shall be considered by the court unless such objection shall have been urged before the Administrator or unless there were reasonable grounds for failure so to do. The finding of the Administrator as to the facts, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive. If any party shall apply to the court for leave to adduce additional evidence, and shall show to the satisfaction of the court that such additional evidence is material and that there were reasonable grounds for failure to adduce such evidence in the proceeding before the Administrator the court may order such additional evidence to be taken before the Administrator and to be adduced upon the hearing in such manner and upon such terms and conditions as to the court may seem proper. The Administrator may modify his
findings as to the facts by reason of the additional evidence so taken, and he shall file with the court such modified or new findings, which, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive, and his recommendation , if any,

viction of the violation of Federal law, or, if no conviction has been had, more

On failure of the plaintiff so to proceed, judgment of non prosequitur may be rendered against him, with costs for the defendant. (Amended Aug. 23, 1916, c. 399, 39 Stat. 532. ) (U. S.

UNITED STATES MAY BE MADE A PARTY DEFENDANT IN CERTAIN CASES
(Act Mar. 4, 1931, c. 515, 48 Stat. 1529, etc. )
SEC. 1. Upon the conditions herein prescribed for the protection of the United States, the consent of the United States be, and it is hereby given, to be named a party in any suit which is now pending or which may hereafter be brought in any United States district court, including those for the districts of Alaska, Hawaii , and Puerto Rico, and the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, and in any State court having jurisdiction of the subject matter, for the foreclosure of a mortgage or other lien upon real estate, for the purpose of securing an adjudication touching any mortgage or other lien the United States may have or claim on the premises involved. ( May 17, 1932, c. 190, 47 Stat. 158. ) ( U. S. C., Title 28, § 901. )
SEC. 2. Service upon the United States shall be made by serving the process of the court with a copy of the bill of complaint upon the United States attorney for the district or division in which the suit has been or may be brought and by sending copies of the process and bill, by registered mail, to the Attorney General of the United States at Washington, D. C. The United States shall have 60 days after service as above provided , or such further time as the court may allow, within which to appear and answer, plead or demur. (U. S. C., Title 28, § 902. )
SEC. 3. Any such suit brought against the United States in any State court may be removed by the United States to the United States district court for the district in which the suit may be pending. The removal shall be effected in the manner prescribed by section 29 of the Judicial Code (title 28, section 72, U. S. C.) : Provided, That the petition for removal may be filed at any time before the expiration of 30 days after the time herein or by the court allowed to the United States to answer, and no removal bond shall be required.

( U. S. C. , Title 28, § 903. )
SEO. 4. Except as herein otherwise provided , a judicial sale made in pursuance of a judgment in such a suit shall have the same effect respecting the discharge of the property from liens and encumbrances held by the United States as may be provided with respect to such matters by the law of the State, Territory, or District in which the land is situated, provided that a sale to satisfy a lien inferior to one of the United States shall be made subject to and without disturbing the lien of the United States, unless the United States, by its attorneys, consents that the property may be sold free of its mortgage or lien and the proceeds divided as the parties may be entitled : And provided further, That where a sale is made to satisfy a lien prior to that of the United States, the United States shall have one year from the date of sale within which to redeem. In any case where the debt owing the United States is due, the United States may ask, by way of affirmative relief, for the foreclosure of its own lien or mortgage and in any case where property is sold to satisfy a first mortgage or first lien held by the United States, the United States may bid at the sale such sum not exceeding the amount of its claim with expenses of sale, as may be directed by the chief of the department, bureau or other agency of the Government which has charge of the administration of the laws in respect of which the claim of the United States arises.

If after appropriate investigation, it appears to such officer that the proceeds from the sale of the property would be insufficient to satisfy, in whole or in part, the lien of the United States, or that the claim of the United States has been satisfied, or by lapse of time or otherwise has become unenforceable, such officer shall so report to the Comptroller General who thereupon may issue a certificate of release, which shall operate to release the property from such lien. ( U. S. C., Title 28, § 905. )
SEC. 6. No judgment for costs or other money judgment shall be rendered against the United States in any suit or proceeding which may be instituted

TITLE 42-THE PUBLIC HEALTH
UNEMPLOYMENT TRUST FUND
(a) There is hereby established in the Treasury of the United States a trust fund to be known as the "unemployment trust fund", hereinafter in this title called the "fund". The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to receive and hold in the fund all moneys deposited therein by a State agency from a State unemployment fund, or by the Railroad Retirement Board to the credit of the railroad unemployment insurance account. Such deposit may be made directly with the Secretary of the Treasury or with any Federal Reserve bank or member bank of the Federal Reserve System designated by him for such purpose.
(b) It shall be the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury to invest such portion of the Fund as is not, in his judgment, required to meet current withdrawals. Such investment may be made only in interest bearing obligations of the United States or in obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the United States. For such purpose such obligations may be acquired (1) on original issue at par, or ( 2) by purchase of outstanding obligations at the market price. The purposes for which obligations of the United States may be issued under the Second Liberty Bond Act, as amended, are hereby extended to authorize the issuance at par of special obligations exclusively to the Fund. Such special obligations shall bear interest at a rate equal to the average rate of interest, computed as of the end of the calendar month next preceding the date of such issue, borne by all interest-bearing obligations of the United States then forming part of the public debt ; except that where such average rate is not a multiple of one-eight of 1 per centum, the rate of interest of such special obligations shall be the multiple of one-eighth of 1 per centum next lower than such average rate. Obligations other than such special obligations may be acquired for the Fund only on such terms as to provide an investment yield not less than the yield which would be required in the case of special obligations if issued to the Fund upon the date of such acquisition.
(c) Any obligations acquired by the Fund (except special obligations issued exclusively to the Fund ) may be sold at the market price, and such special obligations may be redeemed at par plus accrued interest.

APPENDIX

CLXXXIII

(d) The interest on, and the proceeds from the sale or redemption of, any obligations held in the Fund shall be credited to and form a part of the Fund.
(e) The fund shall be invested as a single fund, but the Secretary of the Treasury shall maintain a separate book account for each State agency and the railroad unemployment insurance account and shall credit quarterly on March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31, of each year, to each account, on the basis of the average daily balance of such account, a proportionate part of the earnings of the fund for the quarter ending on such date.
( f) The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to pay out of the Fund to any State agency such amount as it may duly requisition, not exceeding the amount standing to the account of such State agency at the time of such payment. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to make such payments out of the fund as the Railroad Retirement Board may duly certify, not exceeding the amount standing to the railroad unemployment insurance account at the time of such payment.

ALIEN ENEMY PROPERTY AND INCOME
Section 24 of the Trading with the Enemy Act, as amended, provides as follows :
"(a ) The Alien Property Custodian is authorized to pay all taxes (including special assessments) , heretofore or hereafter lawfully assessed by any body politic against any money or other property held by him or by the Treasurer of the United States under this Act, and to pay the necessary expenses incurred by him or by any depositary for him in securing the possession, collection, or control of any such money or other property, or in protecting or administering the same. Such taxes and expenses shall be paid out of the money or other
property against which such taxes are assessed or in respect of which such expenses are incurred, or ( if such money or other property is insufficient) out of any other money or property held for the same person, notwithstanding the fact that a claim may have been filed or suit instituted under this Act. No claim shall be filed with the Alien Property Custodian or
allowed by him or by the President of the United States, nor shall any suit be instituted or maintained against the Alien Property Custodian or the Treasurer of the United States, or the United States, under any provisions of law, by any person who was an enemy or ally of enemy as defined in the Trading with the Enemy Act, as amended, and no allowance of any such claim now pending shall be made, nor judgment entered in any such suit heretofore or hereafter instituted, for the recovery of any deduction or deductions, heretofore or hereafter made by the Alien Property Custodian from money or properties, or income therefrom, held by him or by the Treasurer of the United States hereunder, for the general or administrative expenses of the office of the Alien Property Custodian, which deduction or deductions on the collection of any income do not exceed the sum of two per centum of such income or which on the return of any moneys or properties or income therefrom, do not exceed the sum of two per centum of the aggregate value thereof at the time or times as nearly as may be, of such deduction or deductions, or, for the recovery of any deduction, or deductions heretofore or hereafter made by the Alien Property Custodian from money or properties or income therefrom held by him or by the Treasurer of the United States hereunder, for any and all necessary expenses incurred and actually disbursed by the Alien Property Custodian or by any depositary for him in securing the possession, collection or control of any such money or properties or income therefrom, or in protecting or adminis-

CLXXXIV CODIFICATION OF INTERNAL REVENUE LAWS
tering the same, as said general or administrative and other expenses and said aggregate value of returned money or properties or income therefrom have been heretofore or shall be hereafter determined by said Alien Property Custodian. (Amended Mar. 28, 1934, c. 102, Title I, Sec. 1, 48 Stat. 510. )
"(b) In the case of income, war-profits, excess-profits, or estate taxes imposed by any Act of Congress, the amount thereof shall, under regulations prescribed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, be computed in the same manner ( except as hereinafter in this section provided ) as though the money or other property had not been seized by or paid to the Alien Property Custodian, and shall be paid, as far as practicable, in accordance with subsection ( a ) of this section. Pending final determination of the tax liability the Alien Property Custodian is authorized to return, in accordance with the provisions of this Act, money or other property in any trust in such amounts as may be determined, under regulations prescribed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, to be consistent with the prompt payment of the full amount of the internal-revenue taxes. Notwithstanding the expiration of any period of limitation provided by law, credit or refund of any income, warprofits, or excess-profits tax erroneously or illegally assessed or collected may be made or allowed if claim therefor was filed with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue by the Alien Property Custodian on or before February 15, 1933. ( Amended June 18, 1934, c. 567, 48 Stat. 978. ).
"(c) So much of the net income of a taxpayer for the taxable year 1917, or any succeeding taxable year, as represents the gain derived from the sale or exchange by the Alien Property Custodian of any property conveyed, transferred, assigned, delivered, or paid to him, or seized by him, may at the option of the taxpayer be segregated from the net income and separately taxed at the rate of 30 per centum. This subsection shall be applied and the amount of net income to be so segregated shall be determined , under regulations prescribed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, as nearly as may be in the same manner as provided in section 208 of the Revenue Act of 1926 ( relating to capital net gains ) , but without regard to the period for which the property was held by the Alien Property Custodian before its sale or exchange, and whether or not the taxpayer is an individual .
"(d) Any property sold or exchanged by the Alien Property Custodian (whether before or after the date of the enactment of the Settlement of War Claims Act of 1928) shall be considered as having been compulsorily or involuntarily converted, within the meaning of the income, excess-profits, and war-profits tax laws and regulations ; and the provisions of such laws and regulations relating to such a conversion shall (under regulations prescribed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury) apply in the case of the proceeds of such sale or exchange. For the purpose of determining whether the proceeds of such conversion have been expended within such time as will entitle the taxpayer to the benefits of such laws and regulations relating to such a conversion, the date of the return of the proceeds to the person entitled thereto shall be considered as the date of the conversion.
"(e) In case of any internal-revenue tax imposed in respect of property conveyed, transferred , assigned, delivered, or paid to the Alien Property Custodian, or seized by him, and imposed in respect of any period ( in the taxable year 1917 or any succeeding taxable year ) during which such property was held by him or by the Treasurer of the United States, no interest or civil penalty shall be assessed upon, collected from, or paid by or on behalf of, the taxpayer ; nor shall any interest be credited or paid to the taxpayer in respect of any credit or refund allowed or made in respect of such tax.
"(f) The benefits of subsections ( c ) , ( d ) , and ( e ) shall be extended to the taxpayer if claim therefor is filed before the expiration of the period of limitations properly applicable thereto, or before the expiration of six months after the date of the enactment of the Settlement of War Claims Act of 1928, whichever date is the later. The benefits of subsection ( d ) shall also be extended to the taxpayer if claim therefor is filed before the expiration of six months after the return of the proceeds.

"When an American enterprise, by reason of its participation in the management or capital of a French enterprise, makes or imposes on the latter, in their commercial or financial relations, conditions different from those which would be made with a third enterprise, any profits which should normally have appeared in the balance sheet of the French enterprise, but which have been, in this manner, diverted to the American enterprise, are, subject to the measures of appeal applicable in the case of the tax on industrial and commercial profits, incorporated in the taxable profits of the French enterprise.
"The same principle applies mutatis mutandis, in the event that profits are diverted from an American enterprise to a French enterprise.
"ARTICLE V
"American corporations which maintain in France permanent establishments may, in derogation of article 3 of the decree of December 6, 1872, elect to pay the tax on income from securities on three-fourths of the profits actually derived from such establishments, the industrial and commercial profits being determined in accordance with Article I.
"An American corporation which wishes to place itself under the regime of the preceding paragraph must make a declaration to that effect at the Bureau of Registration within six months after the date upon which this agreement becomes effective or within six months after the creation of its establishment in France. The election made for one establishment applies to all the estab lishments of such corporation. Any such election is irrevocable.

"An American corporation shall not be subject to the obligation prescribed by article 3 of the decree of December 6, 1872, by reason of any participation in the management or in the capital of, or any other relations with, a French corporation, if such American corporation and French corporation conform to the requirements of the present article. In such case, the tax on income from securities continues to be levied, in conformity with French legislation, on the dividends, interest and all other products distributed by the French enterprise ; but it is moreover exigible, if the occasion arises, and subject to the measures of appeal applicable in the case of the tax on income from securities, on the profits which the American corporation derives from the French corporation under the conditions prescribed in Article IV.

"PROTOCOL

"At the moment of signing the Convention on Double Taxation between the
United States of America and the Republic of France, the undersigned plenipotentiaries, duly authorized by their respective Governments, have agreed, as follows :
"(1) The taxes referred to in this agreement are : "(a) for the United States : the Federal income tax-but it is understood that Article I does not exempt from tax (1 ) compensation for labor or personal services performed in the United States ; ( 2) income derived from real property located in the United States, or from any interest in such property, including rentals and royalties therefrom, and gains from the sale or the disposition thereof ; (3 ) dividends ; (4) interest. 4"6 (b) For France :
-in Articles I, II, III and IV, the tax on industrial and commercial profits (impôt sur les bénéfices industriels et commerciaux) ;
"-in Articles III, V and VI, the tax on income from securities ( impôt sur les revenues des valeurs mobilières ) ;
"--in Articles VII, VIII and IX, the tax on wages and salaries, pensions and life annuities ( impôt sur les traitements et salaires, pensions et rentes viagè-

res) , and other schedular taxes (impôts cédulaires) appropriate to the type of income specified in said articles ;

"(2) The provisions of this agreement shall not be construed to affect in any manner any exemption, deduction, credit or other allowance accorded by the laws of one of the contracting States in the determination of the tax imposed by such State.

"(3) As used in this agreement : "(a) The term "permanent establishment" includes branches, mines and oil wells, factories, workshops, warehouses, offices, agencies, and other fixed places of business, but does not include a subsidiary corporation. "When an enterprise of one of the States carries on business in the other State through an agent established there who is authorized to contract for

its account, it is considered as having a permanent establishment in the latter State.

"But the fact that an enterprise of one of the contracting States has business dealings in the other State through a bona fide commission agent or broker shall not be held to mean that such enterprise has a permanent establishment in the latter State.

"(b) The term "enterprise" includes every form of undertaking whether carried on by an individual, partnership (société en nom collectif) , corporation ( société anonyme ) , or any other entity.
"(c) The term "enterprise of one of the contracting States" means, as the case may be, "American enterprise" or "French enterprise."
"(d) The term "American enterprise" means an enterprise carried on in the United States by a citizen of the United States or by an American corporation or other entity ; the term "American corporation or other entity" means a partnership, corporation or other entity created or organized in the United States or under the law of the United States or of any State or Territory of the United States.

"(e) The term "French enterprise" is defined in the same manner, mutatis mutandis, as the term "American enterprise."

"(f) The American corporations mentioned in Articles V and VI are those which, owing to their form of organization, are subject to article 3 of the

decree of December 6, 1872. The present agreement does not modify the regime of "abonnement" for securities.

"(g ) The term "United States," when used in a geographical sense, includes only the States and the Territories of Alaska and Hawaii, and the District of Columbia.

"(h) The term "France," when used in a geographic sense, indicates the

country of France, exclusive of Algeria and the Colonies.

And whereas, the said convention and protocol have been ratified on both parts, and the ratifications of the two Governments were exchanged at Paris on the 9th day of April, 1935 ;
And whereas, it is stipulated in Article X of the said convention that the convention shall become effective on the 1st day of January following the exchange of ratifications, that is to say on the 1st day of January, 1936 ;

ROOSEVELT, President of the United States of America, have caused the said convention and the said protocol to be made public, to the end that the same and every article and clause thereof may be observed and fulfilled with good faith by the United States of America and the citizens thereof on and from the 1st day of January, 1936.

With the exception of three small loans, which are exempt from the payment of all taxes and duties of the United States, except estate, inheritance, or gift taxes, all interest-bearing obligations of the United States now outstanding have been issued under the Second Liberty Bond Act, approved September 24, 1917, as amended, and the same Act is the present authority for the Secretary of the Treasury to borrow money through the sale of additional amounts of interestbearing obligations of the United States.
CLASSES OF SECURITIES
The following classes of securities are authorized by the Second Liberty Bond Act.
(a) Bonds of the United States, those termed Treasury bonds, bearing interest. Treasury bonds are issued with maturities more than 5 years from the date of issue, in two forms : ( 1 ) coupon ( or bearer) bonds, payable to bearer, with coupons attached for the payment of interest when due ; and ( 2 ) registered bonds, payable to an inscribed owner, and with interest paid through checks drawn to the order of the inscribed owner. Both forms are issued in the
denominations of $50, $100, $500, $1,000, $5,000, $10,000 and $100,000 (except that the $50 denomination is not available for some of the earlier issues of Treasury bonds) . Coupon and registered bonds are interchangeable for like amounts of the same issue.
(b) United States Savings bonds, are issued on a discount basis . They may be issued with maturities not less than 10 nor more than 20 years from the issue date, and at prices to yield an investment return of not over 3 percent compounded semiannually. They are redeemable at the option of holders before maturity at increasing redemption values. These bonds are issued only in registered form and in the denominations of $25, $50, $100, $500 and $ 1,000 (maturity value ) . They are not transferable.
Notes of the United States, bearing interest, with maturities not less than one nor more than five years from date of issue. These notes are termed
Treasury notes, and they are issued only in coupon form payable to bearer, with coupons attached for the payment of interest when due, in denominations of $100, $500, $1,000, $5,000, $10,000, $100,000 (but the $50 denomination may be provided for some series. )
Certificates of Indebtedness, commonly termed Treasury certificates of indebtedness, bearing interest, with maturities not exceeding one year from date of issue. These certificates are issued only in coupon form payable to bearer, with coupons attached for the payment of interest when due, in denominations of $500, $1,000, $5,000, $10,000 and $100,000 ( but the $100 denomination may be provided for some series ) .
Treasury Bills, with maturities not exceeding one year from date of issue. These bills are issued on a discount basis, and in denominations of $1,000, $10,000, $100,000, $500,000 and $1,000,000 ( maturity value ) , payable to bearer.
TAX EXEMPTIONS
The provisions of the Second Liberty Bond Act, as amended, now in effect provide for tax exemptions of the public debt securities issued and outstanding, or issuable under that Act.
Treasury Bonds and United States Savings Bonds. All such bonds are exempt, both as to principal and interest, from all taxation now or hereafter imposed by the United States, any State, or any of the possessions of the United States, or by any local taxing authority, except ( a ) estate, inheritance, or gift taxes and (b) graduated additional income taxes, commonly known as surtaxes, and excess-profits and war-profits taxes, now or hereafter imposed by the United States, upon the income or profits of individuals, partnerships, associations, or corporations. The interest on an amount of such bonds the principal of which does not exceed in the aggregate $5,000 owned by any individual, partnership, association, or corporation, is exempt from the taxes provided for in subdivision ( b) mentioned above. For the purpose of determining taxes and tax-exemptions on United States Savings bonds, the increment in value represented by the difference between the price paid and the price received (whether at or before maturity ) is considered as interest.
Treasury Notes.-The notes may be issued in any one or more of the following series as the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe in connection with the issue thereof :
(1 ) Exempt, both as to principal and interest, from all taxation ( except estate, inheritance, or gift taxes ) now or hereafter imposed by the United

CXC

States, any State, or any of the possessions of the United States, or by any local taxing authority ;

(NOTE. Provision (1 ) applies to Treasury notes outstanding October 31, 1935. For any notes thereafter issued, the terms should be examined for tax exemptions. )
Treasury Certificates of Indebtedness.-All certificates of indebtedness are exempt, both as to principal and interest, from all taxation (except estate, inheritance, or gift taxes) now or hereafter imposed by the United States, any State, or any of the possessions of the United States, or by any local taxing authority.
Treasury Bills.-All Treasury bills are exempt, both as to principal and interest, from all taxation (except estate, inheritance, or gift taxes ) now or hereafter imposed by the United States, any State, or any of the possessions of the United States, or by any local taxing authority ; and the amount of discount at which Treasury bills are originally sold by the United States is considered to be interest within the meaning of this provision.
Any gain from the sale or other disposition of Treasury bills is exempt from all taxation (except estate, inheritance, or gift taxes ) now or hereafter imposed by the United States, any State, or any of the possessions of the United States, or by any local taxing authority ; and no loss from the sale or other disposition of such Treasury bills is allowable as a deduction, or otherwise recognized, for the purposes of any tax now or hereafter imposed by the United States or any of its possessions.

Part IV-Digest of Opinions Construing the Repeal
Provisions of the Revised Statutes
SEC. 5595. The foregoing seventy-three titles embrace the statutes
of the United States general and permanent in their nature, in force on the 1st day of December one thousand eight hundred and seventythree, as revised and consolidated by commissioners appointed under
an act of Congress, and the same shall be designated and cited as The Revised Statutes of the United States.
U. S. v. Bowen, 100 U. S. 508
Bowen, a Civil War veteran, was drawing a pension for service in the United States Army, during which certain deductions were made from his pay. On September 13, 1876, he entered the Soldiers' Home. This action was to recover the amount of the pension from the time he entered the home until he left it, December 4, 1877. Judgment was rendered in his favor in the United States Court of Claims for $264.60, and the Government appealed . The Supreme Court affirmed the judgment. The act of 1851 founding the institution provided that pensioners were entitled to the privileges of the home upon transferring their pension for the period they were in it to the Soldiers' Home; and the act of 1859 changing the name to the "Soldiers' Home" provided for such transfer. R. S. 4820 provided : "* * * the fact that one to whom a pension has been granted for wounds or disability received in the military service, has not contributed to the funds of the Soldiers' Home, shall not preclude him from admission thereto; but all such pensioners shall surrender their pensions to the Soldiers' Home during the time they remain therein and voluntarily receive its benefits." It was held the
word "such" above quoted distinguished those who had not contributed to the funds of the Soldiers' Home from those who had so contributed . Bowen by his pay reductions while in the service had contributed to the funds of the home. Therefore, he was in the class that were not required to surrender their pensions. The court said : "The Revised Statutes must be treated as the legislative declaration of the statute law on the subjects which they embrace on the 1st day of December, 1873. When the meaning is plain the courts cannot look to the statutes which have been revised to see if Congress erred in that revision, but may do so when nece"s" sary to construe doubtful language used in expressing the meaning of Congress.'
See also Deffeback v. Hawke, 115 U. S. 392, where the court said, "No reference * * * can be had to the original statutes to control the construction of any section of the Revised Statutes, when its meaning is plain, although in the original statutes it may have had a larger or more limited application than that given to it in the revision, " citing U. S. v. Bowen, 100 U. S. 508, 513.
Dwight v. Merritt, 140 U. S. 213
Action by an importer against a collector of customs to recover alleged excess duties on a shipment of iron rails from Russia. The collector assessed a duty on the merchandise at 70 cents per hundred pounds under Schedule E, section 2504, Revised Statutes, as " iron bars for railroads or inclined planes." The importer claimed the merchandise was dutiable at only $8 per ton under the following provision of the same schedule: "Wrought scrap iron of every description: eight dollars per ton. But nothing shall be deemed scrap iron except waste or refuse iron that has been in actual use, and is fit only to be remanufactured ." The importer paid the duty assessed under protest and brought this action to recover the difference between the amount paid and what he claimed he should have paid, or $2,880.65. The jury, under instructions from the court that the only question to be considered was whether the rails had been in actual use, found for the collector. Writ of error to the United States Supreme Court. Judgment affirmed. Before the Supreme Court the importer contended the action of the collector was illegal in assessing as " iron bars for railroads or inclined planes" old iron rails which were not adapted to any such use, but which were imported solely for remanufacture. The law as it stood prior to enactment of the Revised Statutes read: "On all iron imported in bars for railroads or inclined planes made to patterns and fitted to be laid down upon such roads or planes without

further manufacture." It was contended that no meaning should be attached to the Revised Statutes different from that in the tariff acts. As to this contention, the court said: "The Revised Statutes are not a mere compilation and consolidation of the laws of Congress in force on the 1st of December, 1873. The object of that revision was to simplify and bring together all statutes and parts of statutes which, from similarity of subject, ought to be brought together, to expunge redundant and obsolete enactments, and to make such alterations as might be necessary to reconcile contradictions and amend imperfections in the original text of the preexisting statutes. All those statutes were abrogated by section 5596." They may be referred to and considered in order to interpret the meaning of obscure and ambiguous phrases in any section of said revision; but no such reference is necessary or proper in order to modify, under the color of interpretation, any phrases the meaning of which is clear and free from any doubt, except what the terms of the statute invoked may suggest. "The title of the Revised Statutes headed ' Duties Upon Imports' is manifestly intended to be a complete system of tariff legislation, and to embrace and provide for every class of imported articles subject to import duties. The clause * * * (in Schedule E, section 2504) * * * is in clear, explicit and intelligible language. There is nothing in that clause or in any other clause in that section, or in any other section in that title, which renders the meaning of this particular phrase doubtful or leaves room for interpretation or the interpolation of words taken from other preceding statutes upon the subject."
The Marine City, 6 Fed. Rep . 413
Libel in Admiralty to recover for loss of baggage against a steamship company. Defense was there was no allegation that the loss was caused by design or neglect of the company. R. S. 4282 provided no recovery could be had against owners of vessels for loss or damage to "merchandise" by fire unless such fire is caused by design or neglect of owner. The act of 1851 , from which R. S. 4282 was taken, used the term "any goods or merchandise whatsoever." The court, in determining whether baggage is merchandise within the meaning of the law said the courts could not interpolate words omitted in the revision; and that although the commissioners preparing the Revised Statutes may have thought the word "merchandise" broad enough to include " any goods or merchandise whatsoever," it did not do so. The court said further: "That the revision ought to be construed
not simply as declaring what was the law on the 1st of December 1873, but as changing the law in certain cases, was evidently the opinion of my learned predecessor in Gillet v. Pierce (Brown, Adm. 553) , in which he had occasion to hold that the revision expressly gave the right of trial by jury in certain admiralty cases arising upon the Lakes, notwithstanding it had never before existed. It is true the revision was designed simply as a reenactment or codification of the whole body of the national statutory law, but if the legal effect of each section is to be determined by an examination of the original law from which such section was taken, it might as well never have been adopted. Errors and inadvertent omissions are inevitable in a codification of this extent. Many of them were corrected by the act of February 1875, and in the practical application of the revision others will undoubtedly be discovered ; but the *r* em*edy* is with Congress and not in subtle and forced judicial construction
U. S. v. Moore, 26 Fed . Cas. 15,804
An indictment and plea in abatement that one of the persons composing the grand jury indicting defendant was disqualified by reason of the fact that he had without duress and coercion served in the Confederate Army. The language of the section was contained in an act of 1862, which was repealed by an act of 1871 , but was carried into the Revised Statutes as section 820. Held, the juror was not disqualified. The language relied on was not the law on December 1, 1873, having been repealed . The language of this section does not enact or reenact anything as law which was not the law on the 1st day of December 1873 , and the carrying into the Revised Statutes of a section of an act which had been expressly repealed prior to that date does not reenact such section.

Wade v. United States, 21 Ct. Cl. 141
This case was filed May 24, 1872, to recover the proceeds of property under the Abandoned or Captured Property Act of 1863. It was dismissed for want of prosecution May 8, 1876. It again came before the Court of Claims on motion to
reinstate it for the purpose of raising on trial the question that the 2 years ' limitation on filing suits in the above act was repealed by the Revised Statutes, leaving applicable thereto only the general limitation of 6 years provided for in section 1069.
It was held that R. S. 1069 could not be held to repeal the Abandoned or Captured Property Act, the provisions of that act having been carried into the Revised Statutes as section 1059. Instead of reenacting the full language, for condensation and conciseness, the Revised Statutes merely provided that the

APPENDIX

CXCVII

Court should have jurisdiction of "all claims for the proceeds of captured or abandoned property, as provided in the act of Mar. 12, 1863." The court exam-
ined the legislative history and concluded that it was not the intention of Congress to open the jurisdictional limitation of the Abandoned or Captured Property Act by the adoption of the Revised Statutes, and stated : "Where the language of the revision is ambiguous and uncertain, arising from condensation or otherwise, the well-settled meaning, object, and policy of the preexisting laws revised and reenacted therein must be held to be continued as the true interpretation of the legislative will."

SEC. 5596. All acts of Congress passed prior to said first day of December one thousand eight hundred and seventy-three, any portion
of which is embraced in any section of said revision, are hereby re-
pealed, and the section applicable thereto shall be in force in lieu
thereof; all parts of such acts not contained in such revision, having been repealed or superseded by subsequent acts, or not being general and permanent in their nature: Provided, That the incorporation into
said revision of any general and permanent provision , taken from an act making appropriations, or from an act containing other provisions
of a private, local, or temporary character, shall not repeal, or in any way affect any appropriation , or any provision of a private, local or
temporary character, contained in any of said acts, but the same shall remain in force ; and all acts of Congress passed prior to said last-
named day no part of which are embraced in said revision , shall not be affected or changed by its enactment.
U. S. v. Claflin, et al. , 25 Fed . Cas. 14,799
Action brought in the District Court for the Southern District of New York to recover a penalty of double the value of goods alleged to have been bought, concealed and illegally imported . Certain counts of the declaration were based on Section 2 of the act of March 3, 1823 (3 Stat. 781) . To these defendants demurred on the ground that this section had been repealed. The court sustained the demurrer, saying : "It is quite clear that the 2d section of the act of March 3, 1823 must be regarded as having been repealed by section 5596 of the Revised Statutes (even if it had not been previously repealed) , on the ground that some portion of that act is embraced in the Revised Statutes, the provisions of the first section of that act being embraced in section 3099 of the Revised Statutes, and the provisions of the 2d section of that act not being embraced in any section of the Revised Statutes. The effect of such repeal is to destroy the right of the plaintiffs to recover under said 2d section in respect of any acts done after the enactment of the Revised Statutes. Therefore, counts 7, 9, 11 and 13 of declaration No. 2 are bad." The judgment of the District Court was
affirmed by the Circuit Court for the Southern District of New York and by the United States Supreme Court, which held (97 U. S. 546) that the 2d section of the act of March 3, 1823 was repealed by the act of July 18, 1866 ( 14 Stat. 179) .
U. S. v. Webster, 21 Fed. Rep . 187
One count of an indictment charged the defendant with unlawfully withholding from its owner a discharge paper. This count was based on the act of May 21 , 1872 (c. 178, 17 Stat. 137) which consisted of one section and prescribed punishment for withholding of discharge papers and land warrants. Defendant moved the court to instruct the jury that the law on which this count was based had been repealed, contending that R. S. 5485 embraced only the portion of the act of May 21, 1872 with respect to land warrants and that by R. S. 5596, therefore, the other portion had been repealed. The motion was denied, the court holding that the act of May 21 , 1872 with respect to discharge papers was still in force notwithstanding the enactment of the Revised Statutes. The portion of the act of May 21, 1872 with respect to land warrants was repealed by section 31 of the act of March 3, 1873 (c. 234, 17 Stat. 566, 575) but the portion with respect to discharge papers was not repealed. R. S. 5485 was taken from section 31 of the act of March 3, 1873. The portion of the act of May 21 , 1872 with respect to discharge papers which was in force on December 1, 1873, was not carried into the Revised Statutes. Section 5596 of the Revised Statutes provides that acts of Congress passed prior to December 1 , 1873, no part of which is embraced in the Revision, shall not be affected or changed by its enactment. No part of the portion of the act of May 21 , 1872, with respect to discharge papers having been embraced in the Revised Statutes, it was still in force.

SEC. 5597. The repeal of the several acts embraced in said revision,
shall not affect any act done, or any right accruing or accrued, or any suit or proceeding had or commenced in any civil cause before the said repeal, but all rights and liabilities under said acts shall continue , and may be enforced in the same manner, as if said repeal had not been made ; nor shall said repeal, in any manner affect the right to any office, or change the term or tenure thereof.
Bechtel v. United States, 101 U. S. 597
Suit by the United States commenced October 9, 1872, before the enactment of the Revised Statutes, against a bondsman for a manufacturer of matches who had failed to account for certain stamps. At the trial there were admitted in evidence certain transcripts, including a certificate dated October 11 , 1872, pursuant to an act of March 3, 1797. It was contended by the defendant that this act had been repealed by section 5596 of the Revised Statutes. Directed verdict for the United States. Appeal to the United States Supreme Court. One ground of appeal was alleged error in admitting in evidence the certificate issued pursuant to the act of March 3, 1797. Judgment of lower court affirmed. The Supreme Court held that section 5597 saved all rights which had accrued under any act repealed by section 5596, and therefore the provisions of the act of March 3, 1797, and not the Revised Statutes, were applicable to this case.
Claflin v. Houseman , 93 U. S. 130
Action brought in May 1872 in the Supreme Court of New York by Houseman, assignee in bankruptcy of Comstock and Young against Claflin to recover $ 1,935.57 collected by Claflin on a judgment against the bankrupt firm in fraud of the bankrupt law. Demurrer to the jurisdiction of the court. Judgment for plaintiff and the Court of Appeals of New York affirmed the judgment. Writ of error to the United States Supreme Court. Held, an assignee in bankruptcy under the Bankrupt Act of 1867 could bring suit in State courts whenever those courts were invested with appropriate jurisdiction. Section 5597 of the Revised Statutes provided that repeal of the acts embraced in the revision should not affect any suit or proceeding had or commenced in any civil cause before repeal. The act of 1867 was controlling in this case and not the Revised Statutes.
To the same effect was-
Wilson v. Goodrich, 154 U. S. 640
Error to the Superior Court of Massachusetts. The action was begun March 18, 1872. The case comes within Claflin v. Houseman, 93 U. S. 130, holding that an assignee in bankruptcy under the Bankrupt Act of 1867 as it stood before the Revised Statutes were enacted, had authority to bring suit in State courts whenever those courts were invested with appropriate jurisdiction. Section 5597 provides that the repeal of the acts embraced in the revision should not affect any suit or proceeding had or commenced in any civil cause before repeal.

SEC. 5599. All acts of limitation , whether applicable to civil causes and proceedings, or to the prosecution of offenses, or for the recovery of penalties or forfeitures, embraced in said revision and covered by said repeal, shall not be affected thereby, but all suits , proceedings or prosecutions, whether civil or criminal, for causes arising, or acts done or committed prior to said repeal, may be commenced and prosecuted within the same time as if said repeal had not been made.
Sayles, Executor, v. Louisville City R. R. Co. , 9 Fed . 512
Action to recover damages for alleged infringement of a patent right for improvement of railroad brakes. Patent issued July 6, 1852, and reissued and extended July 6, 1866, for a term of 7 years. Defendant pleaded the statute of limitations under the act of July 8, 1870, providing "All actions shall be brought during the term for which the letters patent shall be granted or extended, or within 6 years after the expiration thereof." Suit was brought June 18, 1879, within 6 years of the expiration of the extended term but not within 6 years of the expiration of the first term. Defendant has used the brakes from 1864 to 1873. Plaintiff contended that since a subsequent section of the act of 1870 provided that when an extension was granted that "thereupon the said patent shall have the same

APPENDIX

CXCIX

effect in law as though it had been originally granted for 21 years," the extension had the same effect as though the patent had been originally granted for 21 years from 1852 and that he should be allowed to recover for the 2 years 1864 to 1866, as well as for the term 1866 to 1873. The provision of the act of July 8, 1870,
containing the limitation was omitted fromthe Revised Statutes, and the act of 1870 was repealed by section 5596 of the Revised Statutes. Held, the statute of limi-
tations as pleaded was a bar to recovery under the original term of the patent and recovery would be allowed only as to the extended term ; that the original term and the extended term were two distinct terms. The act of 1870 was
repealed by the Revised Statutes, except as to the statute of limitations contained therein as to causes of action arising thereunder. Section 5599 provided "All acts of limitation embraced in said revision and covered by said repeal shall not be affected thereby, but all * * ** suits for causes arising, or acts done or committed, prior to said repeal may be commenced and prosecuted within the same time as if said repeal had not been made."
Also, Hayden v. Oriental Mills, 22 Fed. 103, Circuit Court, District of Rhode Island, which was an action on a patent. The court said R. S. 5599 saved all rights the same as if suit had been commenced before the repeal of the federal statute of limitations of July 8, 1870.
Also, May v. Buchanan County, Iowa, Circuit Court for the Northern District of Iowa, 29 Fed. 469, action on patent right and statute of 6 years under act of 1870 was pleaded . Court said that as to causes of action arising after June 22, 1874, the limitation was repealed by R. S. 5596; but R. S. 5599 continued the act of 1870 in force as to all causes of action then in existence. Demurrer as to the statute of limitations was overruled .

SEC. 5600. The arrangement and classification of the several sections of the revision have been made for the purpose of a more convenient and orderly arrangement of the same, and therefore no inference or presumption of a legislative construction is to be drawn by reason of the Title, under which any particular section is placed .

Doyle v. Wisconsin , 94 U. S. 50

The Supreme Court of Wisconsin issued a writ of mandamus to recall license issued to an insurance company. The writ was served and obeyed . Afterward

a writ of error was sued out and bond given to operate as a supersedeas. The plaintiff in error contended that as a writ of error to operate as a supersedeas might issue from the Supreme Court to reexamine the judgment of the State court, a writ to carry the judgment into effect could not issue from the State court until the expiration of 10 days after the rendition of the judgment, under section 1007 of the Revised Statutes, as amended by act of February 18, 1875,

which provided: "When a writ of error*may be a""supersedeas, execution shall

not issue until the expiration of 10 days

* * after rendition of judgment.

The writ of error was issued under section 709 of the Revised Statutes, which is

in chapter 11 of title XXXIII , relating to the Judiciary. The provision that a writ of error might operate as a supersedeas, is in section 1007 of the Revised Statutes, as amended, which is in chapter 18 of the Judiciary title. One of these

sections was derived from section 23 of the Judiciary Act of 1879 and the other was derived from section 25 of the same act. The change in arrangement did

not prevent the court from giving effect to their location in the original act.

Hyde v. United States, 225 U. S. 347
Writ of certiorari to the D. C. Court of Appeals. Petitioners convicted in the Supreme Court for the District of Columbia of the crime of conspiracy under section 5440 of the Revised Statutes and the conviction affirmed by the D. C. Court of Appeals. The conspiracy charged was that the petitioners conspired to obtain by fraudulent devices from the States of California and Oregon school lands lying in forest reserves, exchange them for lands of the United States open to selection, and then to sell the lands so obtained.* Judgment affirmed by the Supreme Court. The main question involved was the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia. The court held that overt acts performed in one district by one of the parties who had conspired in another district in violation of R. S. 5440 give jurisdiction to the court in the district where the overt acts are performed as to all the conspirators. In the course of the opinion the court said: "If the unlawful combination and the overt act constitute the offense, as stated in Hyde v. Shine, marking its beginning and its execution or a step to its execution, section 731 of the Revised Statutes must be applied. That section provides that 'when any offense against the United States is begun in one judicial district

C

CODIFICATION OF INTERNAL REVENUE LAWS

and completed in another it shall be deemed to have been committed in either, and may be dealt with, inquired of, tried, determined, and punished in either district, in the same manner as if it had been actually and wholly committed therein.' This provision takes an emphasis of signification from the fact that it was originally a part of the same section of the statute which defined conspiracythat is section 30 of the act of March 2, 1867, 14 Stat. 484, c. 169. Nor has the provision lost the strength of meaning derived from such association by its subsequent separation, for it is provided in section 5600 of the Revised Statutes that "The arrangement and classification of the several sections of the revision have been made for the more convenient and orderly arrangement of the same, and
therefore no inference or presumption of a legislative construction is to be drawn by reason of the title, under which any particular section is placed .'
To the same effect was Buck Stove and Range Co. , 226 U. S. 205 ; U. S. v. Marsh, 106 Fed. 474 ; U. S. v. Thomas, 145 Fed. 74.
Also, King v. McLean Asylum (64 Fed. 331) , in which it was said:
"This section (5600) is expressly limited to arrangement and classification, and does not extend to changes in phraseology."

Page v. Burnstine, 102 U. S. 664

This was an appeal from a decree of the Supreme Court for the District of

Columbia dismissing a bill by the personal representatives of Robert C. Page to recover for the estate the value of a life insurance policy issued November 22,

1866, over and above amounts due Burnstine for loans made by him to Page on

the policy. Loans were made from time to time and assignments taken to the extent of lender's interest. On January 7, 1873, assignment of the policy was made purporting to transfer Page's entire interest. Plaintiffs admitted Burn-

stine's interest but prayed an accounting. The defendant resisted the suit on the ground that at the death of Page he was the absolute owner of the policy and

entitled to all the proceeds. The life insurance company paid the amount due on the policy into court abiding the result of the suit. Some depositions were

taken, among them being one of Burnstine with reference to the loans and the several assignments. As to this, plaintiffs contended Burnstine could not testify

as to any transaction with or statement by the deceased unless called on by them

or required by the court, relying on section 858 of the Revised Statutes. Defendant contended that his right to testify was determined by Sections 876 and

877 of the Revised Statutes relating to the District of Columbia. Plaintiff's

bill was dismissed and appeal taken to the United States Supreme Court, where the decree was reversed and the cause remanded directing an account of the

amount due Burnstine for loans or other payments made to keep the policy in force, and holding that Burnstine could not testify in the suit on his own motion.
In view of the conflict between sections 876 and 877 of the Revised Statutes

for the District of Columbia and section 858 of the Revised Statutes of the United

States, the Supreme Court examined the legislative history of the basic statutes

to determine the intent of Congress. The act of July 2, 1864, relating to the law of evidence in the District was carried into the Revised Statutes for the District

of Columbia as sections 876 and 877, without change; the third section of the act of July 2, 1864, with respect to appropriations, and the amending act of March 3, 1865, were carried into the Revised Statutes of the United States as

section 858, without change ; and the act of February 21 , 1871 , was carried into the Revised Statutes for the District of Columbia as section 93. The court said

that by the third section of the act of July 2, 1864, and the amending act of March 3, 1865, witnesses could not testify in such a case; that the act of February

21, 1871, made the rule applicable to the courts of the District of Columbia unless locally inapplicable, which it was not; and that this was the law as it existed at the time the two revisions went into effect. It said these provisions having

been carried into the two revisions, respectively, without change, Congress did not intend to change the law with respect to the rule of evidence in the District

of Columbia, having so provided by section 1296 of the Revision for the District and by section 5600 of the Revised Statutes of the United States. In this connection the court said:

"We should not, therefore, permit the mere collocation of rearrangement of the

previous statutes in the new revisions, adopted on the same* day, to operate to

change the law, and thereby defeat the will of Congress

* *. For these

reasons, we are of the opinion that Burnstine could not, on his own motion, testify

as to any transaction with, or statement by, the decedent, Page. His deposition as to such transactions, and statements, must be excluded from consideration"

McDonald v. Hovey, 110 U. S. 619
Appeal from the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia. A decree was rendered April 17, 1878, and appeal was taken September 6, 1883. Defendant was sued in New York City upon the decree, judgment rendered against him, and he was thrown into jail, 1879. Appeal having been taken 5

APPENDIX



years after entry of the decree, the Government contended that under section 1008 of the Revised Statutes no judgment or decree shall be reviewed by the Supreme Court unless the appeal is taken within 2 years after the entry of the judgment, except in case of some disability such as insanity. Appellant contended the statute of limitations was suspended by reason of his incarceration . It was held that in order for a disability to suspend the statute it must exist at the time the right arises, which here was upon entry of the decree, and before the appellant was jailed. Section 1008 of the Revised Statutes was taken directly and without change from the second section of the act of June 1, 1872. This last act was a revision of the twenty-second section of the Judiciary Act of 1789. The language was substantially the same. The court said :
"The phraseology of the act of 1872, and of the one thousand and eighth section of the Revised Statutes is so nearly identical with that of the twenty-second section of the act of 1789, in reference to the point under consideration, that we must presume they were intended to have the same construction, and the act of 1789 contains no language which requires that it should have a different construction from that which had long been established in reference to all the statutes of limitation then known, whether in the mother country or in this. On the contrary, as we have seen, the terms of the act of 1789 fairly call for the same construction which had for centuries prevailed in reference to those statutes."
Upon a revision of statutes , a different interpretation is not to be given them without some substantial change of phraseology, some change other than what may have been necessary to abbreviate the form of the laws.

SEC. 5601. The enactment of the said revision is not to affect or
repeal any act of Congress passed since the 1st day of December
one thousand eight hundred and seventy-three, and all acts passed since that date are to have full effect as if passed after the enactment
of this revision, and so far as such acts vary from, or conflict with any
provision contained in said revision, they are to have effect as subsequent statutes, and as repealing any portion of the revision inconsistent therewith.
United States v. Auffmordt, 122 U. S. 197
Action by the United States against Auffmordt and others composing the firm of C. A. Auffmordt & Co., to recover $321,519.29 with interest for alleged false entry as to value of merchandise by reason of which defendants forfeited the value of goods in the above amount to the United States, consigned to them from a manufacturer in Switzerland . After the opening by the United States at the trial, defendants moved for a directed verdict on the ground that there was no statute of the United States whereby the value of the merchandise could be recovered by reason of the acts alleged to have been committed by the defendants. The District Court so ruled and directed a verdict for defendants . Judgment affirmed by the Circuit Court and the case went to the Supreme Court of the United States on writ of error.
Section 2864 of the Revised Statutes, as originally enacted, in providing for a forfeiture of merchandise omitted a provision in the basic act providing for forfeiture of the value thereof. The Revised Statutes were enacted on June 22, 1874, but embraced only the laws in force on December 1 , 1873. The act of February 18, 1875, c. 80, 18 Stat. 319, entitled "An act to correct errors and to supply omissions in the Revised Statutes of the United States," amended section 2864 by restoring the omitted provision. It was contended by the United States that Congress intended by this amendment that R. S. 2864 should provide that the value of such goods should be forfeited . However, this amendment was in conflict with a statute passed on June 22, 1874, which did not provide for forfeiture of value. The court affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court, saying the sole object of the act of February 18, 1875, was to correct errors and supply omissions in the text of the Revised Statutes, as its title indicated, so as to make the same truly express the statutes in force on December 1 , 1873. It was in no sense new legislation nor a new law enacted to take effect from the date of its passage, in such wise as to alter any enactment made since the passage of the Revised Statutes. The intention was to make section 2864 read as it ought to have read in the printed volume, in the shape in which it was in force on the 1st of December 1873, as a part of section 1 of the act of March 3, 1863, c. 76, 12 Stat. 738. It left the act of June 22, 1874, to have its full effect in respect to section 2864, in like manner as if the words "or the value thereof" had been contained in that section, in the printed volume of the Revised Statutes. There was a law in force on December 1 , 1873, and subsequently thereto, down to June 22, 1874, authorizing a forfeiture of the value of merchandise for the causes stated in section 2864, and the fact forfeitures of such value might have been incurred during the intervening period between December 1 , 1873, and June 22, 1874, was a sufficient reason for the correction made in section 2864.

See also The North American Commercial Co. v. United States, 171 U. S. 110, where in reversing the Circuit Court as to the amount owed by the lessor, the Supreme Court said the Revised Statutes were approved June 22, 1874; that by section 5601 provision was made that legislation between December 1 , 1873, and the date of enactment of the revision should take effect as if subsequently passed ; that the act of May 24, 1874, giving the power of limitation to the Secretary of the Treasury operated by way of amendment to the Revised Statutes and removed the restrictions provided in sections 1960 and 1962 of the revision.
See also U. S. v. The "Grace Lothrop," 226 U. S. 527, holding section 5601 of the Revised Statutes provided the revision did not repeal subsequent legislation.
