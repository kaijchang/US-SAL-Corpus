"(c) AMOUNT TO WHICH EXTENSION RELATES AND INSTALLMENT PAYMENTS.-The amount the time for payment of which may be extended under subsection ( a ) with respect to any tax shall not exceed the amount of such tax shown on the return, increased by any amount assessed as a deficiency ( or as interest or additions to the tax ) prior to the date of filing the statement and decreased by any amount paid or required to be paid prior to the date of such filing, and the total amount of the taxes the time for payment of which may be extended shall not exceed the amount stated under clause (3 ) of subsection (b) . For the purposes of this subsection, an amount shall not be considered as

required to be paid unless shown on the return or assessed as a deficiency (or as interest or addition to the tax) , and an amount assessed as a deficiency (or as interest or additions to the tax) shall be considered to be required to be paid prior to the date of filing of the statement if the tenth day after notice and demand for its payment occurs prior to such date.

sidered to be the dates on which payments would have been required if such remainder had been the tax and the taxpayer had elected to pay the tax in four equal instalments as provided in section 56 (b) .
(d) PERIOD OF EXTENSION.-The extension of time for payment provided in this section shall expire--
"(1) on the last day of the month in which falls the last date prescribed by law (including any extension of time granted the taxpayer) for the filing of the return for the taxable year of the expected net operating loss or unused excess profits credit, or
(2 ) if an application for tentative carry-back adjustment provided in section 3780 with respect to such loss or unused credit is filed before the expiration of the period prescribed in clause ( 1 ) , on the date on which notice is mailed by registered mail by the Commissioner to the taxpayer that such application is allowed or disallowed in whole or in part. "(e) REVISED STATEMENTS.-Each statement filed under subsection (a ) with respect to any taxable year shall be in lieu of the last statement previously filed with respect to such year.

The Commissioner shall terminate the extension as to any part of the amount to which it relates which he deems should be terminated

because, upon such examination, he believes that, as of the time such

examination is made, all or any part of the statement clearly is in a material respect erroneous or unreasonable.
"(g) PAYMENTS ON TERMINATION. If an extension of time is terminated under subsection (e) or ( f) with respect to any amount, then-

of the deficiencies assessed under section 3780 (b) and which is

not so satisfied, the rate shall be 6 per centum per annum ; and "(2) upon the remainder of the amount the time for payment of
which has been extended , interest at the rate of 6 per centum per annum to the date such amount is paid. If the Commissioner determines that during the period of extension credit or refund of an overpayment has been allowed or made, or a deficiency assessed , affecting the amount to which the extension relates

and that the taxpayer could not have taken such overpayment or deficiency into account in the statement or a revised statement, appropriate adjustment shall be made in the interest.

"(a) APPLICATION FOR ADJUSTMENT.-A taxpayer may file an application for a tentative carry-back adjustment of the taxes for prior taxable years affected by a net operating loss carry-back, provided in section 122 (b) , or an unused excess profits credit carry-back, provided in section 710 (c) (3) , from any taxable year ending on or after September 30 , 1945. The application shall be verified in the manner prescribed by section 51 or section 52 in the case of a return of such

determined by applying the carry-back in the manner provided by law to the items on the basis of which such taxes were determined. If an application under section 124 (j ) for tentative adjustment of tax with respect to amortization has been previously filed but such adjustment has not been previously determined, then for the purposes of this section the assessments, applications, credits, and refunds provided for in section 124 (k) shall be considered as having previously been made upon the basis of such application under section 124 (j ) ;
"(4) the amount by which the aggregate of such decreases exceeds the aggregate of such increases ;
"(5) the unpaid amount of each such tax, not including any amount required to be shown under paragraph ( 6) ;

"(7) such other information for the purposes of carrying out the provisions of this section as may be required by such regulations.

An application under this subsection shall not constitute a claim for credit or refund.

"(b) ALLOWANCE OF ADJUSTMENTS.-Within a period of ninety days from the date on which an application for a tentative carry-back adjustment is filed under subsection (a ) , or from the last day of the month in which falls the last date prescribed by law (including any

extension of time granted the taxpayer) for filing the return for the taxable year of the net operating loss or unused excess profits credit from which such carry-back results, whichever is the later, the Commissioner shall make, to the extent he deems practicable in such period, a limited examination of the application, to discover omissions and errors of computation therein, and shall determine the amount of the increase or decrease in each tax attributable to such carry-back upon

the basis of the application and the examination, except that the Com-

missioner may disallow, without further action, any application which he finds contains errors of computation which he deems cannot be corrected by him within such ninety-day period or material omissions. Each such increase shall be deemed determined as a deficiency and shall be assessed, without regard to the restrictions on assessment in section 272. Each such decrease shall be applied against any unpaid amount of the tax decreased (including any amount of such tax as to which
an extension of time under section 3779 is in effect) and any remainder shall be credited-

"(1) against the deficiencies (and additions to the tax ) assessed under this subsection,

"(2) against any unsatisfied amount of any tax for the taxable year immediately preceding the taxable year of the net operating loss or unused excess profits credit the time for payment of which tax is extended under section 3779, and

any remainder shall, within such ninety-day period , be either credited
against any income, war profits, or excess profits tax or instalment thereof then due from the taxpayer, or refunded to the taxpayer. The

application, credit or refund of a decrease determined under this subsection shall be deemed a credit or refund of an overpayment within the meaning of sections 781 ( b) and 3807 (b) ( 1) .
"(c) ASSESSMENT OF ERRONEOUS ALLOWANCES .- If the Commissioner determines that the amount applied, credited or refunded under
subsection (b) is in excess of the overassessment attributable to the

carry-back with respect to which such amount was applied, credited

59 STAT. ] 79TH CONG., 1ST SESS.-CH. 340-JULY 31, 1945

or refunded, he may assess the amount of the excess as a deficiency as if it were due to a mathematical error appearing on the face of the return, as provided in section 272 (f) . Upon making such assessment, the Commissioner shall schedule as an overassessment the decrease in
any other tax resulting from the adjustments reflected in the computation of the deficiency.

able year in which such extension was made, there was reasonable cause to expect there would be no such penalty portion. The penalty portion shall be the excess of the amount to which such extension

relates which is not paid by the end of the taxable year in which such

extension is made over 125 per centum of the amount to which such

extension relates which is satisfied by applying thereto a decrease in tax in respect of an application under section 3780 ( a ) less any amounts assessed in respect of such application which are not so satisfied."
