Section 3. Subscriptions : time, place, and form of payment (a) The subscription of each member shall be equal to its quota

(b) Each member shall pay in gold, as a minimum, the smaller of
(i ) twenty-five percent of its quota ; or (ii ) ten percent of its net official holdings of gold and United States
dollars as at the date when the Fund notifies members under Article XX , Section 4 ( a ) that it will shortly be in a position to begin exchange transactions. Each member shall furnish to the Fund the data necessary to determine its net official holdings of gold and United States dollars.

60 STAT. ] MULTILATERAL- INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND- DEC. 27, 1945 1403

(c) Each member shall pay the balance of its quota in its own currency .
( d ) If the net official holdings of gold and United States dollars of any member as at the date referred to in (b ) (ii ) above are not ascertainable because its territories have been occupied by the enemy, the Fund shall fix an appropriate alternative date for determining such holdings. If such date is later than that on which the country becomes eligible under Article XX, Section 4 ( c ) or ( d ) , to buy currencies from the Fund , the Fund and the member shall agree on a provisional gold payment to be made under (b) above, and the balance of the member's subscription shall be paid in the member's currency, subject to appropriate adjustment between the member and the Fund when the net official holdings have been ascertained.
Section 4. Payments when quotas are changed (a) Each member which consents to an increase in its quota shall,
within thirty days after the date of its consent, pay to the Fund twenty-five percent of the increase in gold and the balance in its own currency. If, however, on the date when the member consents to an increase, its monetary reserves are less than its new quota, the Fund may reduce the proportion of the increase to be paid in gold.
(b) If a member consents to a reduction in its quota, the Fund shall, within thirty days after the date of the consent, pay to the member an amount equal to the reduction. The payment shall be made in the member's currency and in such amount of gold as may be necessary to prevent reducing the Fund's holdings of the currency below seventy-five percent of the new quota.
Section 5. Substitution of securities for currency The Fund shall accept from any member in place of any part of the
member's currency which in the judgment of the Fund is not needed for its operations, notes or similar obligations issued by the member or the depository designated by the member under Article XIII, Section 2, which shall be non-negotiable, non-interest bearing and payable at their par value on demand by crediting the account of the Fund in the designated depository. This Section shall apply not only to currency subscribed by members but also to any currency otherwise due to, or acquired by, the Fund.

mote exchange stability, to maintain orderly exchange arrangements with other members , and to avoid competitive exchange alterations.
(b) Each member undertakes, through appropriate measures consistent with this Agreement, to permit within its territories exchange transactions between its currency and the currencies of other members only within the limits prescribed under Section 3 of this Article. A member whose monetary authorities, for the settlement of international transactions, in fact freely buy and sell gold within the limits prescribed by the Fund under Section 2 of this Article shall be deemed to be fulfilling this undertaking.
Section 5. Changes in par values (a ) A member shall not propose a change in the par value of its cur-
rency except to correct a fundamental disequilibrium. (b) A change in the par value of a member's currency may be
made only on the proposal of the member and only after consultation with the Fund.
(c) When a change is proposed , the Fund shall first take into account the changes, if any, which have already taken place in the initial par value of the member's currency as determined under Article XX , Section 4. If the proposed change, together with all previous changes, whether increases or decreases,

(i ) does not exceed ten percent of the initial par value, the Fund shall raise no objection,
(ii ) does not exceed a further ten percent of the initial par value, the Fund may either concur or object, but shall declare its attitude within seventy-two hours if the member so requests,
(iii ) is not within ( i ) or ( ii ) above, the Fund may either concur or object, but shall be entitled to a longer period in which to declare its attitude .

(d ) Uniform changes in par values made under Section 7 of this Article shall not be taken into account in determining whether a proposed change falls within ( 1 ) , ( ii ) , or ( ii1 ) of ( c ) above.

(e) A member may change the par value of its currency without the concurrence of the Fund if the change does not affect the international transactions of members of the Fund.
(f) The Fund shall concur in a proposed change which is within the terms of ( c ) ( ii ) or ( c ) ( iii ) above if it is satisfied that the change is necessary to correct a fundamental disequilibrium. In particular, provided it is so satisfied, it shall not object to a proposed change because of the domestic social or political policies of the member proposing the change.
Section 6. Effect of unauthorized changes If a member changes the par value of its currency despite the objec-
tion of the Fund , in cases where the Fund is entitled to object , the member shall be ineligible to use the resources of the Fund unless the Fund otherwise determines ; and if, after the expiration of a reasonable period, the difference between the member and the Fund continues, the matter shall be subject to the provisions of Article XV, Section 2 ( b) .

Post, p. 1421.

Section 7. Uniform changes in par values Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5 (b) of this Article , the
Fund by a majority of the total voting power may make uniform proportionate changes in the par values of the currencies of all members , provided each such change is approved by every member which has ten percent or more of the total of the quotas.

(i) the member's monetary reserves are below its quota , or (ii) the Fund's holdings of its currency are below seventy-five per-
cent of its quota, or

(b) The Fund may levy a reasonable handling charge on any member buying gold from the Fund or selling gold to the Fund .

ARTICLE VI

CAPITAL TRANSFERS

Section 1. Use of the Fund's resources for capital transfers (a) A member may not make net use of the Fund's resources to
meet a large or sustained outflow of capital, and the Fund may request a member to exercise controls to prevent such use of the resources of the Fund. If, after receiving such a request, a member fails to exercise appropriate controls, the Fund may declare the member ineligible to use the resources of the Fund.
(b) Nothing in this Section shall be deemed

(i ) to prevent the use of the resources of the Fund for capital transactions of reasonable amount required for the expansion of exports or in the ordinary course of trade, banking or other business, or
(ii ) to affect capital movements which are met out of a member's own resources of gold and foreign exchange, but members undertake that such capital movements will be in accordance with the purposes of the Fund.

Section 2. Special provisions for capital transfers

If the Fund's holdings of the currency of a member have remained

below seventy-five percent of its quota for an immediately preceding

period of not less than six months, such member, if it has not been

declared ineligible to use the resources of the Fund under Section 1

of this Article, Article IV, Section 6, Article V, Section 5 , or Article

XV, Section 2 ( a ) , shall be entitled, notwithstanding the provisions of

Section 1 ( a ) of this Article, to buy the currency of another member from the Fund with its own currency for any purpose, including

capital transfers. Purchases for capital transfers under this Section shall not, however, be permitted if they have the effect of raising the Fund's holdings of the currency of the member desiring to purchase above seventy-five percent of its quota, or of reducing the Fund's holdings of the currency desired below seventy-five percent of the quota of the member whose currency is desired .

Section 3. Controls of capital transfers Members may exercise such controls as are necessary to regulate
international capital movements, but no member may exercise these controls in a manner which will restrict payments for current transactions or which will unduly delay transfers of funds in settlement of commitments, except as provided in Article VII, Section 3 ( b) , and in Article XIV, Section 2.

SCARCE CURRENCIES
Section 1. General scarcity of currency If the Fund finds that a general scarcity of a particular currency
is developing, the Fund may so inform members and may issue a report setting forth the causes of the scarcity and containing recommendations designed to bring it to an end. A representative of the member whose currency is involved shall participate in the preparation of the report.
Section 2. Measures to replenish the Fund's holdings of scarce currencies
The Fund may, if it deems such action appropriate to replenish its holdings of any member's currency, take either or both of the following steps :
(i) Propose to the member that, on terms and conditions agreed between the Fund and the member, the latter lend its currency to the Fund or that, with the approval of the member, the Fund borrow such currency from some other source either within or outside the territories of the member, but no member shall be under any obligation to make such loans to the Fund or to approve the borrowing of its currency by the Fund from any other source.
(ii ) Require the member to sell its currency to the Fund for gold.
Section 3. Scarcity of the Fund's holdings (a ) If it becomes evident to the Fund that the demand for a mem-
ber's currency seriously threatens the Fund's ability to supply that currency, the Fund , whether or not it has issued a report under Section 1 of this Article, shall formally declare such currency scarce and shall thenceforth apportion its existing and accruing supply of the scarce currency with due regard to the relative needs of members, the general international economic situation and any other pertinent considerations. The Fund shall also issue a report concerning its action.
(b) A formal declaration under ( a ) above shall operate as an authorization to any member, after consultation with the Fund, temporarily to impose limitations on the freedom of exchange operations in the scarce currency. Subject to the provisions of Article IV, Sections 3 and 4, the member shall have complete jurisdiction in determining the nature of such limitations, but they shall be no more restrictive than is necessary to limit the demand for the scarce currency to the supply held by, or accruing to, the member in question ; and they shall be relaxed and removed as rapidly as conditions permit.
(c) The authorization under (b) above shall expire whenever the Fund formally declares the currency in question to be no longer scarce.
Section 4. Administration of restrictions Any member imposing restrictions in respect of the currency of
any other member pursuant to the provisions of Section 3 (b ) of this
Article shall give sympathetic consideration to any representations by the other member regarding the administration of such restrictions.

TRANSITIONAL PERIOD

Section 1. Introduction The Fund is not intended to provide facilities for relief or recon-
struction or to deal with international indebtedness arising out of the war.

Section 2. Exchange restrictions In the post- war transitional period members may, notwithstanding
the provisions of any other articles of this Agreement, maintain and adapt to changing circumstances ( and , in the case of members whose territories have been occupied by the enemy, introduce where necessary) restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions. Members shall , however, have continuous regard in their foreign exchange policies to the purposes of the fund ; and, as soon as conditions permit , they shall take all possible measures to develop such commercial and financial arrangements with other members as will facilitate international payments and the maintenance of exchange stability. In particular, members shall withdraw restrictions maintained or imposed under this Section as soon as they are satisfied that they will be able, in the absence of such restrictions, to settle their balance of payments in a manner which will not unduly encumber their access to the resources of the Fund.

Post, p. 1427.

Section 3. Notification to the Fund Each member shall notify the Fund before it becomes eligible under
Article XX , Section 4 ( c ) or ( d ) , to buy currency from the Fund , whether it intends to avail itself of the transitional arrangements in

Section 2 of this Article, or whether it is prepared to accept the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2 , 3, and 4. A member availing itself of the transitional arrangements shall notify the Fund as soon thereafter as it is prepared to accept the above-mentioned obligations. Section 4. Action of the Fund relating to restrictions
Not later than three years after the date on which the Fund begins operations and in each year thereafter, the Fund shall report on the restrictions still in force under Section 2 of this Article. Five years after the date on which the Fund begins operations, and in each year thereafter, any member still retaining any restrictions inconsistent with Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, or 4, shall consult the Fund as to their further retention. The Fund may, if it deems such action necessary in exceptional circumstances , make representations to any member that conditions are favorable for the withdrawal of any particular restriction, or for the general abandonment of restrictions, inconsistent with the provisions of any other articles of this Agreement. The member shall be given a suitable time to reply to such representations. If the Fund finds that the member persists in maintaining restrictions which are inconsistent with the purposes of the Fund , the member shall be subject to Article XV, Section 2 ( a ) .
Section 5. Nature of transitional period In its relations with members, the Fund shall recognize that the
post-war transitional period will be one of change and adjustment and in making decisions on requests occasioned thereby which are presented by any member it shall give the member the benefit of any reasonable doubt.

(c) The holdings of other official institutions or other banks with-

deducted from such holdings amounts of currency due to official institutions and banks in the territories of members or non-members

specified under (d ) below.

Section 4. Initial determination of par values

(a) When the Fund is of the opinion that it will shortly be in a position to begin exchange transactions, it shall so notify the members

and shall request each member to communicate within thirty days

the par value of its currency based on the rates of exchange prevailing on the sixtieth day before the entry into force of this Agreement.

No member whose metropolitan territory has been occupied by the enemy shall be required to make such a communication while that

territory is a theater of major hostilities or for such period thereafter

as the Fund may determine. When such a member communicates the par value of its currency the provisions of ( d ) below shall apply.

(b) The par value communicated by a member whose metropolitan territory has not been occupied by the enemy shall be the par value of

that member's currency for the purposes of this Agreement unless, within ninety days after the request referred to in ( a ) above has

been received, (i ) the member notifies the Fund that it regards the par value as unsatisfactory, or ( ii ) the Fund notifies the member

that in its opinion the par value cannot be maintained without causing recourse to the Fund on the part of that member or others on a scale

prejudicial to the Fund and to members. When notification is given under (i ) or ( ii ) above, the Fund and the member shall, within a

period determined by the Fund in the light of all relevant circumstances, agree upon a suitable par value for that currency. If the Fund and the member do not agree within the period so determined, the member shall be deemed to have withdrawn from the Fund on the

date when the period expires.

(c) When the par value of a member's currency has been established

under (b) above, either by the expiration of ninety days without notification, or by agreement after notification , the member shall be

eligible to buy from the Fund the currencies of other members to the

full extent permitted in this Agreement, provided that the Fund has begun exchange transactions.
(d ) In the case of a member whose metropolitan territory has been occupied by the enemy, the provisions of (b) above shall apply, subject to the following modifications :

Territory occupied by enemy .

1428

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [ 60 STAT.

(i ) The period of ninety days shall be extended so as to end on a date to be fixed by agreement between the Fund and the member.
(ii ) Within the extended period the member may, if the Fund has begun exchange transactions, buy from the Fund with its currency the currencies of other members, but only under such conditions and in such amounts as may be prescribed by the Fund.
(iii ) At any time before the date fixed under ( i ) above, changes may be made by agreement with the Fund in the par value communicated under ( a ) above.

(e) If a member whose metropolitan territory has been occupied by the enemy adopts a new monetary unit before the date to be fixed

Ante, p. 1404. Ante, p. 1426.

under (d ) (i ) above, the par value fixed by that member for the new unit shall be communicated to the Fund and the provisions of ( d ) above shall apply.
(f) Changes in par values agreed with the Fund under this Section shall not be taken into account in determining whether a proposed change falls within ( i ) , ( ii ) , or ( iii ) of Article IV , Section 5 ( c) .
(g) A member communicating to the Fund a par value for the currency of its metropolitan territory shall simultaneously communicate a value, in terms of that currency, for each separate currency, where such exists, in the territories in respect of which it has accepted this Agreement under Section 2 ( g ) of this Article, but no member shall be

required to make a communication for the separate currency of a ter-

ritory which has been occupied by the enemy while that territory is a

theater of major hostilities or for such period thereafter as the Fund

may determine. On the basis of the par value so communicated, the

Fund shall compute the par value of each separate currency. A com-

munication or notification to the Fund under ( a ) , (b) or ( d ) above

regarding the par value of a currency, shall also be deemed , unless

the contrary is stated , to be a communication or notification regarding

the par value of all the separate currencies referred to above . Any

member may, however, make a communication or notification relating

to the metropolitan or any of the separate currencies alone. If the

member does so , the provisions of the preceding paragraphs ( including

( d ) above, if a territory where a separate currency exists has been

occupied by the enemy ) shall apply to each of these currencies

separately. (h ) The Fund shall begin exchange transactions at such date as
it may determine after members having sixty-five percent of the totel of the quotas set forth in Schedule A have become eligible, in accord-

ance with the preceding paragraphs of this Section , to purchase the

currencies of other members , but in no event until after major

hostilities in Europe have ceased .

(i ) The Fund may postpone exchange transactions with any mem-

ber if its circumstances are such that, in the opinion of the Fund ,

they would lead to use of the resources of the Fund in a manner

60 STAT. ] MULTILATERAL- INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND-DEC. 27, 1945 1429

contrary to the purposes of this Agreement or prejudicial to the Fund or the members.
(j ) The par values of the currencies of governments which indicate their desire to become members after December 31 , 1945 , shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Article II, Section 2.
DONE at Washington, in a single copy which shall remain deposited in the archives of the Government of the United States of America, which shall transmit certified copies to all governments whose names are set forth in Schedule A and to all governments whose membership is approved in accordance with Article II, Section 2.

Agreed declaration by the President of the United States of America, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and the Prime Minister of Canada respecting atomic energy. Signed at Washington November 15, 1945.

ATOMIC ENERGY AGREED DECLARATION BY
The President of the United States, The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and The Prime Minister of Canada.

1480

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [ 60 Stat.

THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, THE PRIME MINISTER OF THE UNITED KINGDOM, AND THE PRIME MINISTER OF CANADA, have issued the following statement.
1. We recognize that the application of recent scientific discoveries to the methods and practice of war has placed at the disposal of mankind means of destruction hitherto unknown , against which there can be no adequate military defence, and in the employment of which no single nation can in fact have a monopoly.
2. We desire to emphasize that the responsibility for devising means to ensure that the new discoveries shall be used for the benefit of mankind, instead of as a means of destruction, rests not on our nations alone, but upon the whole civilized world . Nevertheless , the progress that we have made in the development and use of atomic energy demands that we take an initiative in the matter, and we have accordingly met together to consider the possibility of international action :-
(a) To prevent the use of atomic energy for destructive purposes (b) To promote the use of recent and future advances in scien-
tific knowledge, particularly in the utilization of atomic energy, for peaceful and humanitarian ends.
3. We are aware that the only complete protection for the civilized world from the destructive use of scientific knowledge lies in the prevention of war. No system of safeguards that can be devised will of itself provide an effective guarantee against production of atomic weapons by a nation bent on aggression. Nor can we ignore the possibility of the development of other weapons, or of new methods of warfare, which may constitute as great a threat to civilization as the military use of atomic energy.
4. Representing as we do , the three countries which possess the knowledge essential to the use of atomic emergy, we declare at the outset our willingness, as a first contribution, to proceed with the exchange of fundamental scientific information and the interchange of scientists and scientific literature for peaceful ends with any nation that will fully reciprocate.
5. We believe that the fruits of scientific research should be made available to all nations, and that freedom of investigation and free interchange of ideas are essential to the progress of knowledge. In pursuance of this policy, the basic scientific information essential to the development of atomic energy for peaceful purposes has already been made available to the world. It is our intention that all further information of this character that may become available from time

60 STAT. ] UNITED KINGDOM AND CANADA-ATOMIC ENERGY- NOV. 15, 1945
to time shall be similarly treated . We trust that other nations will adopt the same policy, thereby creating an atmosphere of reciprocal confidence in which political agreement and cooperation will flourish.
6. We have considered the question of the disclosure of detailed information concerning the practical industrial application of atomic energy. The military exploitation of atomic energy depends, in large part, upon the same methods and processes as would be required for industrial uses.
We are not convinced that the spreading of the specialized information regarding the practical application of atomic energy, before it is possible to devise effective, reciprocal, and enforceable safeguards acceptable to all nations, would contribute to a constructive solution of the problem of the atomic bomb. On the contrary we think it might have the opposite effect. We are, however, prepared to share, on a reciprocal basis with others of the United Nations, detailed information concerning the practical industrial application of atomic energy just as soon as effective enforceable safeguards against its use for destructive purposes can be devised.
7. In order to attain the most effective means of entirely eliminating the use of atomic energy for destructive purposes and promoting its widest use for industrial and humanitarian purposes, we are of the opinion that at the earliest practicable date a Commission should be set up under the United Nations Organization to prepare recommendations for submission to the Organization .
The Commission should be instructed to proceed with the utmost dispatch and should be authorized to submit recommendations from time to time dealing with separate phases of its work.
In particular the Commission should make specific proposals :
(a) For extending between all nations the exchange of basic scientific information for peaceful ends,
(b) For control of atomic energy to the extent necessary to ensure its use only for peaceful purposes,
(c) For the elimination from national armaments of atomic weapons and of all other major weapons adaptable to mass destruction,
(d ) For effective safeguards by way of inspection and other means to protect complying states against the hazards of violations and evasions.
8. The work of the Commission should proceed by separate stages, the successful completion of each one of which will develop the necessary confidence of the world before the next stage is undertaken. Specifically it is considered that the Commission might well devote its attention first to the wide exchange of scientists and scientific information, and as a second stage to the development of full knowledge concerning natural resources of raw materials.
9. Faced with the terrible realities of the application of science to destruction, every nation will realize more urgently than before the overwhelming need to maintain the rule of law among nations and to

1481

1482

banish the scourge of war from the earth. This can only be brought about by giving wholehearted support to the United Nations Organization, and by consolidating and extending its authority, thus creating conditions of mutual trust in which all peoples will be free to devote themselves to the arts of peace. It is our firm resolve to work without reservation to achieve these ends.

(f) Prior to the time when such power may be conferred by law upon the aeronautical authorities of the United States, if one of the Contracting Parties is dissatisfied with any new rate proposed by the air carrier or carriers of either Contracting Party for services from the territory of one Contracting Party to a point or points in the territory of the other Contracting Party, it shall so notify the other prior to the expiry of the first fifteen of the thirty day period referred to in paragraph (c) above, and the Contracting Parties shall endeavour to reach agreement on the appropriate rate. In the event that such

agreement is reached each Contracting Party will use its best efforts

to cause such agreed rate to be put into effect by its air carrier or carriers. It is recognised that if no such agreement can be reached prior to the expiry of such thirty days, the Contracting Party raising the objection to the rate may take such steps as it may consider necessary to prevent the inauguration or continuation of the service

in question at the rate complained of.

rates for the transport of persons and property by air on international services and to suspend proposed rates in a manner comparable to that in which the Civil Aeronautics Board at present is empowered

to act with respect to such rates for the transport of persons and property by air within the United States.

(a) Where the onward carriage of traffic by an aircraft of different size from that employed on the earlier stage of the same route (hereinafter referred to as "change of gauge" ) is justified by reason of economy

of operation, such change of gauge at a point in the territory of the United Kingdom or the territory of the United States shall not be made in violation of the principles set forth in the Final Act of the Conference on Civil Aviation held at Bermuda from January 15 to February 11 , 1946 and, in particular, shall be subject to there being an adequate volume of through traffic.

(b) Where a change of gauge is made at a point in the territory of the United Kingdom or in the territory of the United States , the smaller aircraft will operate only in connection with the larger aircraft arriving at the point of change, so as to provide a connecting service

which will thus normally wait on the arrival of the larger aircraft , for the primary purpose of carrying onward those passengers who have travelled to United Kingdom or United States territory in the larger aircraft to their ultimate destination in the smaller aircraft. Where

there are vacancies in the smaller aircraft such vacancies may be

filled with passengers from United Kingdom or United States territory

respectively. It is understood however that the capacity of the smaller

aircraft shall be determined with primary reference to the traffic

travelling in the larger aircraft normally requiring to be carried onward .

(c) It is agreed that the arrangements under any part of the pre-

ceding paragraphs (a) and (b) shall be governed by and in no way restrictive of the standards set forth in paragraph (6) of the Final Act .

The Final Plenary Session was held on the 11th February, 1946 . As a result of the deliberations of the Conference there was formulated an Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom and the Government of the United States relating to air services. between their respective territories, and Annex thereto. (Attached hereto as Appendix I.)
The following resolution was adopted :-
Whereas representatives of the two Governments have met together in Bermuda to discuss Civil Aviation matters outstanding between them and have reached agreement thereon ,
Whereas the two Governments have to-day concluded an Agreement relating to air services between their respective territories (hereinafter called " the Agreement" ) ,
And whereas the two Governments have reached agreement on the procedure to be followed in the settlement of other matters in the field of Civil Aviation,

60 STAT. ] UNITED KINGDOM-AIR SERVICES -FEB. 11, 1946
Now therefore the representatives of the two Governments in Conference resolve and agree as follows :-
( 1 ) That the two Governments desire to foster and encourage the widest possible distribution of the benefits of air travel for the general good of mankind at the cheapest rates consistent with sound economic principles ; and to stimulate international air travel as a means of promoting friendly understanding and good will among peoples and ensuring as well the many indirect benefits of this new form of transportation to the common welfare of both countries.
(2) That the two Governments reaffirm their adherence to the principles and purposes set out in the preamble to the Convention on International Civil Aviation signed at Chicago on the 7th December, 1944 .
(3) That the air transport facilities available to the travelling public should bear a close relationship to the requirements of the public for such transport .
(4) That there shall be a fair and equal opportunity for the carriers of the two nations to operate on any route between their respective territories (as defined in the Agreement) covered by the Agreement and its Annex.
(5) That, in the operation by the air carriers of either Government of the trunk services described in the Annex to the Agreement , the interest of the air carriers of the other Government shall be taken into consideration so as not to affect unduly the services which the latter provides on all or part of the same routes.
(6) That it is the understanding of both Governments that services provided by a designated air carrier under the Agreement and its Annex shall retain as their primary objective the provision of capacity adequate to the traffic demands between the country of which such air carrier is a national and the country of ultimate destination of the traffic . The right to embark or disembark on such services international traffic destined for and coming from third countries at a point or points on the routes specified in the Annex to the Agreement shall be applied in accordance with the general principles of orderly development to which both Governments subscribe and shall be subject to the general principle that capacity should be related :
(a) to traffic requirements between the country of origin and the countries of destination ;
(b) to the requirements of through airline operation ; and (c) to the traffic requirements of the area through which the airline
passes after taking account of local and regional services .
(7) That, in so far as the air carrier or carriers of one Government may be temporarily prevented through difficulties arising from the War from taking immediate advantage of the opportunity referred to in paragraph (4) above, the situation shall be reviewed between the Governments with the object of facilitating the necessary development, as soon as the air carrier or carriers of the first Government is or are in a position increasingly to make their proper contribution to the service.

1515

1516

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [ 60 Stat.

(8) That duly authorised United States civil air carriers will enjoy non-discriminatory "Two Freedom " privileges and the exercise (in accordance with the Agreement or any continuing or subsequent agreement) of commercial traffic rights at airports located in territory of the United Kingdom which have been constructed in whole or in part with United States funds and are designated for use by international civil air carriers .
(9) That it is the intention of both Governments that there should be regular and frequent consultation between their respective aeronautical authorities (as defined in the Agreement) and that there should thereby be close collaboration in the observance of the principles and the implementation of the provisions outlined herein and in the Agreement and its Annex.

In witness whereof the following Delegates sign the present Final Act .
Done at Bermuda the eleventh day of February, 1946 .

This Final Act shall be deposited in the Archives of the Government of the United Kingdom and a certified copy shall be transmitted by that Government to the Government of the United States of America .

Government of the United Kingdom may, however, in exceptional cases, decline to accept articles which it has designated for transfer, but agrees in that event to settle under the offsetting arrangement for the costs (including costs of contract cancellations) incurred by the Government of the United States in connection with such articles, less the value of such articles to the Government of the United States

such loading ; provided that risk of loss not recoverable from the sup-

plier, carrier or other third party shall be assumed by the Government of the United Kingdom

Any articles that shall not have been transferred as provided in this paragraph prior to midnight on December 31 , 1946 or 6 months after

ferred as of such later date. Amount ofpayment

(b) In the case of bulk commodities for import into the United

on reciprocal aid, entered on ocean bill of lading during the period

from September 2, 1945 to December 31 , 1945 , inclusive . All com-

modities entered on ocean bill of lading after the latter date will be for cash settlement. Transfer to the Government of the United

States shall be deemed to have taken place immediately upon loading

of the articles on board ocean vessel. Title and risk of loss with

respect to such articles shall pass at the time of such loading. (c) In the case of bulk commodities for import into the United
States for which the Government of the United States itself makes

payment in the first instance , the offsetting arrangement will not apply, and the Government of the United Kingdom will not reimburse the Government of the United States for any such commodities entered on ocean bill of lading after midnight on September 1 , 1945. The Government of the United Kingdom will reimburse the Government of the United States in cash for commodities covered by approved requisitions for reimbursement under reciprocal aid entered on

Post, p. 1563.

E. OFFSETTING ARRANGEMENT
The Joint Statement of December 6, 1945 contemplated that the total amounts due for certain supplies and services furnished after September 1 , 1945 through lend-lease and reciprocal aid channels to the Governments of the United Kingdom and of the United States respectively, would be offset in order finally to compute the net sum due from the Government of the United Kingdom to the Government of the United States in accordance with paragraph 3 of the Joint Statement. The sum of $ 118,000,000 appearing in paragraph 3 (a) of the Joint Statement represented the best estimate then obtainable of the net amount which would be due to the Government of the United States under paragraph 3 (a) , after deducting the net sum due to the Government of the United Kingdom under the claims settlement. The net sum due to the Government of the United Kingdom under the Agreement on Settlement of Intergovernmental Claims concluded this day (No. II) has been finally computed at $ 53,020,000 .
The supplies and services to be brought into this offsetting arrangement are those so specified in this Agreement. The total amounts due for such supplies and services will be computed in accordance with the principles set forth in this Agreement .
An agreed accounting procedure shall be established for the computation of the net sum due under this offsetting arrangement.

Nations, the Governments of the United States and of the United

Kingdom agree that, effective September 2 , 1945, the disposition and

use of lend-lease articles which were (a) in the possession or control

on September 2 , 1945 of the United Kingdom Armed Forces (including

their supply agents) or (b) transferred to them thereafter on straight lend-lease terms (both hereinafter referred to as " lend-lease articles" ) ,

1. Under Article V of the Mutual Aid Agreement of February 23 , 1942 between the Governments of the United States and of the United Kingdom, the Government of the United States has the right to recover at the end of the present emergency as determined by the President, such defense articles transferred under that Agreement as have not been destroyed , lost or consumed, and as shall be determined by the President to be useful in the defense of the United States or of the Western Hemisphere, or to be otherwise of use to the United States of America. It is agreed that this right of recapture may be exercised at any time after September 1 , 1945 with respect to lend-lease articles which, as of the date upon which notice requesting return is communicated to the Government of the United Kingdom , are not destroyed , lost, consumed or disposed of in accordance with this Agreement.

ture of any lend-lease articles held by the United Kingdom Armed Forces, but does not intend to exercise generally this right of recapture. In respect of cases where it wishes from time to time to exercise

its right of recapture, the Government of the United States will give reasonable notice of its intention and will provide full opportunity to the Government of the United Kingdom for discussion of that Government's need for the articles in question, without limiting the right of recapture referred to in paragraph 1 hereof. The Government of the United Kingdom will make the arrangements for effecting the physical return to the custody of the Government of the United States, at such points as the latter may designate, of the lend-lease articles to be recaptured , and will use its best endeavors to see that all reasonable care is exercised in order to prevent loss of or damage to such articles during the process of return. The Government of the United States will, however, take into consideration the practical difficulties in particular cases, especially as to designation of points of delivery, and will cooperate with the Government of the United

plying Government shall lodge with the recipient Government. The

supplying Government may decline to accept any lend-lease or re-

ciprocal aid articles which may be offered for return . The recipient

Government shall not be required to notify the supplying Government

before disposing of or abandoning any lend-lease or reciprocal aid

articles which become surplus to the military requirements of the

recipient Government. Nothing in this paragraph shall, however, be construed as overriding the provisions of paragraphs 6 , 7 , and 8 hereof.

in all cases be made for purposes compatible with the principles of international security and welfare set forth in the Charter of the

United Nations. Contingent forces serving under United Kingdom

command may, subject to the prior authority of the Government of

and the government making the withdrawal .

Disposal of lendlease articles for civilian use.

7. Lend -lease articles may be disposed of for civilian use, whether

by sale, lease or otherwise, outside the United Kingdom and British

Colonial Dependencies only after the Government of the United

States has been offered and has declined their return and has approved

such disposal of the articles . Any disposals in this category shall be

for the account of the Government of the United States and the pro-

ceeds of any such disposal, net of selling and other relevant and necessary expenses, shall accrue to the Government of the United States

in the currency in which payment was made to the Government of the

United Kingdom. Net proceeds in respect of the period from September 2 , 1945 onwards under leases , arranged before that date, of lend-lease articles for civilian use outside the United Kingdom and British Colonial Dependencies will similarly accrue to the Govern-

ment of the United States . Such payment by the Government of the United Kingdom will constitute fulfilment of obligations laid upon it

by this paragraph in respect of such leases . The foregoing provisions

of this paragraph shall be without prejudice to the possible conclusion

at a later date of separate arrangements between the governments concerned providing for the comprehensive settlement of the rights

and obligations arising from the disposal for civilian use within a

given country outside the United Kingdom and British Colonial

Dependencies of lend-lease articles in the possession or control of the

United Kingdom Armed Forces. It is understood that although the disposal oflend-lease articles within the United Kingdom and British Colo-

nial Dependencies shall be at the full discretion of the governments con-

cerned, these governments will not in practice be releasing such articles

for export or for civilian use except to a very limited extent. In view of this understanding, the total sum due to the Government of

the United States pursuant to the Joint Statement of December 6 , 1945 is deemed to include an adequate compensation for the value of

In the light of experience gained during such period, the Government of the United

States will review with the Government of the United Kingdom this

arrangement , with a view to determining whether an accounting to the Government of the United States for net proceeds from such disposals recorded prior to such period or derived thereafter need be undertaken .

1553

oil companies, limiting the importation from the United States of plant and materials necessary to rehabilitate American oil properties in certain British areas, were discussed and cleared up individually on a satisfactory basis.

1. The Governments of the United States and the United Kingdom

have reached an understanding for the settlement of Lend-Lease and

Reciprocal Aid, for the acquisition of United States Army and Navy

surplus property, and the United States interest in installations , lo-

cated in the United Kingdom , and for the final settlement of the

financial claims of each government against the other arising out of

the conduct of the war. Specific agreements necessary to implement

these understandings , setting forth the terms in detail, and consistent

Finality and completeness of settle-
maenndtRecfoirprLoecanldA- Lieda.se

herewith, are in the course of preparation and will shortly be completed. 2. This settlement for Lend-Lease and Reciprocal Aid will be com-
plete and final. In arriving at this settlement both Governments have taken full cognizance of the benefits already received by them in the defeat of their common enemies. They have also taken full cog-

nizance of the general obligations assumed by them in Article VII of the Mutual Aid Agreement of February 23, 1942 , and the under-

standings agreed upon this day with regard to commercial policy. Pursuant to this settlement, both Governments will continue to discuss arrangements for agreed action for the attainment of the economic

objectives referred to in Article VII of the Mutual Aid Agreement. The Governments expect in these discussions to reach specific conclusions at an early date with respect to urgent problems such as those in the field of telecommunications and civil aviation. In the

light of all the foregoing, both Governments agree that no further

benefits will be sought as consideration for Lend-Lease and Reciprocal Aid .

tion of surplus property, and the United States interest in installa-

tions, located in the United Kingdom, and for the settlement of claims

shall be $ 650,000,000 subject to the accounting adjustment referred to below. This amount consists of (a) a net sum of $ 118,000,000 repre-

senting the difference between the amount of the services and supplies

interest in installations, located in the United Kingdom and owned

by the United States Government. The actual amounts due to the respective Governments for items included in (a) above other than

claims will, however, be ascertained by accounting in due course, and

the total sum of $ 650,000,000 will be adjusted for any difference between the sum of $ 118,000,000 mentioned above and the actual

ments after December 31 , 1945, will be settled by cash payment. 4. The total liability found to be due to the Government of the
United States will be discharged on the same terms as those specified

Terms for discharge oftotal liability due to
U.S.

in the Financial Agreement concluded this day for the discharge of

the credit provided therein. 5. In addition to the financial payments referred to above, the two

Governments have agreed upon the following :

(a) Appropriate non-discriminatory treatment will be extended to United States nationals in the use and disposition of installations in which there is a United States interest ;

(b) Appropriate settlements for the Lend-Lease interest in installations other than in the United Kingdom and the Colonial Dependencies will be made on disposal of the installations ;

(c) The United States reserves its right of recapture of any LendLease articles held by United Kingdom Armed Forces, but the United States has indicated that it does not intend to exercise

generally this right of recapture ; (d) Disposals for military use to forces other than the United

Kingdom Armed Forces of Lend-Lease articles held by the United

Kingdom Armed Forces at V-J Day, and disposals for civilian use

other than in the United Kingdom and the Colonial Dependencies

of such Lend-Lease articles , will be made only with the consent of the United States Government and any net proceeds will be paid

to the United States Government. The United Kingdom Government agrees that except to a very limited extent it will not release

for civilian use in, or export from, the United Kingdom and the

Colonial Dependencies Lend-Lease articles held by the United Kingdom Armed Forces.

(e) The Government of the United Kingdom will use its best

endeavors to prevent the export to the United States of any surplus

property transferred in accordance with this understanding. 6. The Government of the United Kingdom agrees that, when requested by the Government of the United States from time to

time prior to December 31 , 1951 , it will transfer, in cash, pounds sterling to an aggregate dollar value not in excess of $50,000,000 , at the exchange rates prevailing at the times of transfer, to be credited

against the dollar payments due to the Government of the United States as principal under this settlement. The Government of the

United States will use these pounds sterling exclusively to acquire

land or to acquire or construct buildings in the United Kingdom and the Colonial Dependencies for the use of the Government of the

United States , and for carrying out educational programs in accordance with agreements to be concluded between the two Governments.

7. The arrangements set out in this statement are without prejudice

to any settlements concerning Lend-Lease and Reciprocal Aid which may be negotiated between the Government of the United States

and the Governments of Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa , and India.

56 Stat. 1433. 56 Stat. 1594.

Whereas there was signed and sealed at Washington on the twentyfourth day of August 1942 , for the Government of the United States of America and for the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland , in further fulfillment of the policy set forth in their Agreement of February 23 , 1942 on the principles applying to mutual aid in the prosecution of the war against aggression , an Agreement deemed to have been in effect and operation as from January 1 , 1942 concerning the interchange of patent rights , information, inventions , designs, or processes ; and
Whereas it is desirable to amend the said Agreement of August 24, 1942 in certain particulars ;
Now, therefore, it is agreed by the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland that the said Agreement of August 24, 1942 shall be and is hereby amended to read as follows :

ARTICLE I

Reciprocal procurement of patent rights,

(a) Each Government, in so far as it may lawfully do so , will procure

etc.; availability.

and make available to the other Government, for use in war produc-

tion , patent rights , information, inventions, designs , or processes

requested by the other Government. In the case of the United States

of America, the law authorizing such procurement and transfer is now the Act of the Congress of the United States approved March 11 , 1941 (Public 11 , 77th Congress) , as amended . Each Government will

bear the cost of the procurement of such patent rights , information ,

"Nationals."

inventions , designs , or processes from its own nationals. (b) In this Agreement the term "nationals" in relation to the

United States of America shall mean all natural persons who on

May 8 , 1945 were exclusively citizens of the United States of America,

all corporations, partnerships, and associations organized under the laws of the United States of America , its territories, the several

States , or the District of Columbia , and all natural persons domiciled or resident in the United States of America on May 8 , 1945 , as well as the Government of the United States of America and all of its agencies, but the term " nationals" in relation to the United States of America

subjects of the United Kingdom even though they were domiciled or resident in the United States of America on that date. In this Agree-

ment the term "nationals" in relation to the United Kingdom shall

and not covered by patents or patent applications shall be acquired upon such terms as may most expeditiously make such information ,

inventions, designs , or processes available for the purposes of the war, with provision, to the extent practicable , for the limitation of the use thereof for the purposes of and until the termination of the war. When the information , invention, design, or process is of a category for which the other Government requests secrecy upon security

dependent on the date of the signing of a peace treaty.

ARTICLE III
Such acquisition by the Government of the United States of America will be effected in accordance with regular Lend-Lease procedure (or its then current equivalent) and will be financed under such program , except that other procedure may be used in those instances where no expenditure of funds is necessary.

April 17, 1945 [T. I. A. S. 1511]

Agreement between the United States of America and the Union of South Africa respecting mutual aid. Effected by exchange of notes signed at Washington April 17, 1945; effective April 17, 1945.

The South African Chargé d'Affaires ad interim to the Secretary of State

SIR, With reference to the memorandum dated May 8th from the
State Department and recent discussions between representatives of the Union of South Africa and those of the State Department and the Foreign Economic Administration concerning the proposal that all forms of mutual aid provided by either the Government of the Union of South Africa or of the United States to the other should be
financed by cash payments as from February 15 , 1944 , I am directed to inform you that the Union Government agrees to the application of such a cash basis in its relations with the United States Government .
(2) The Union Government is accordingly prepared to accept liability for all combat material , aircraft and other goods shipped on and after 15th February, 1944 , and supplied direct by the Government of the United States , or by means of retransfer from other Governments , on orders placed by the Union Government. This would include equipment for coastal defence undertaken by the Union Government in agreement with the Government of the United Kingdom, but would not include the provision of aircraft and equipment for the Flying Boat Squadron No. 262 at present based on Durban, which is , by agreement with the United Kingdom, a liability of the latter government, in so far as the procurement of aircraft, spares and related equipment is concerned .
(3) The basis of the foregoing proposal is that liability for goods supplied should follow the authority responsible for the issue of the order of procurement. The Union Government would, therefore, be liable solely for goods received in accordance with the provisions of the preceding paragraph and it would not be liable for any goods which the United Kingdom Government may supply for the temporary or intermittent use of the Union Forces under United Kingdom operational control outside the boundaries of the Union of South Africa in compliance with the terms of the financial arrangements in existence between the two governments.
(4) If the Government of the United States of America concurs in the foregoing, I would suggest that the present note and your reply to that effect be regarded as placing on record the understanding of our two Governments in this matter.

LEGATION OF THE UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA WASHINGTON, D.C. 17th April, 1945.
The Honourable E. R. STETTINIUS, Secretary of State of the United States, Department of State, Washington, D. C.
ANNEX
It is the understanding of the Government of the Union of South Africa that the following interpretations apply to the provisions of this note :
(1) The word " shipped " in the first sentence of paragraph (2 ) denotes the actual placing of goods on board ship ; or in the case of other goods , such as aircraft and stores carried on them, the time at which the Government of the United States transfers such goods to the Union Government ;
(2) The words "on orders placed by the Union Government", in the first sentence of paragraph (2 ) cover the case of any goods retransferred by any Government and accepted by the Union Government .
(3) Certain squadrons were formed and equipped in the Union of South Africa with Lend-Lease aircraft and, for a considerable period , carried out operations from Union bases . Subsequently these squadrons , complete with aircraft and equipment, proceeded for operational work in the Mediterranean. Such aircraft and equipment furnished prior to 15th February, 1944, which have subsequently been transferred to the Mediterranean Theatre and later returned to the Union will be regarded as Lend-Lease material supplied to the Union Government before 15th February, 1944 .
(4) For so far as the Joint Air Training Scheme in the Union of South Africa is concerned , it is the understanding of the Union Government that they will not be required to pay for aircraft and equipment which the United Kingdom is obligated to supply for the scheme and which are used solely for that purpose.
(5) Goods are frequently landed in the Union by mistake e. g. when they arrive without shipping documents and ships have to be cleared without delay . It is the understanding of the Union Government that such goods will not be regarded as "accepted " by them , although they may be stored by the responsible authorities for security purposes pending a directive from the United States Government as to their disposition.

DEPARTMENT OF STATE WASHINGTON

SIR :

April 17, 1945.

I set forth below my understanding of the conclusions reached in conversations which have taken place from time to time during the past year between representatives of the Government of the United

States and the Government of the Union of South Africa with regard to post-war economic settlements .
Our two Governments are engaged in a cooperative undertaking, together with every other nation or people of like mind , to the end of laying the bases of a just and enduring world peace securing order under law to themselves and all nations . They are in agreement that post-war settlements must be such as to promote mutually advantageous economic relations between them and the betterment of world-wide economic relations .
To that end the Governments of the United States of America and

of the Union of South Africa are prepared to cooperate in formulating a program of agreed action , open to participation by all other countries

of like mind, directed to the expansion , by appropriate international and domestic measures, of production, employment , and the exchange and consumption of goods , which are the material foundations of the

liberty and welfare of all peoples ; to the elimination of all forms of discriminatory treatment in international commerce, and to the reduction of tariffs and other trade barriers ; and, in general, to the attainment of all the economic objectives set forth in the Joint Declaration made on August 14, 1941 by the President of the United States of America and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom .
Our Governments have in large measure similar interests in postwar international economic policy . They undertake to enter at an early convenient date into conversations between themselves and with

representatives of other United Nations with a view to determining, in the light of governing economic conditions, the best means of attaining the above-stated objectives by agreed action on the part of our two Governments and other like-minded Governments .
If the Government of the Union of South Africa concurs in the

foregoing statement of conclusions , I would suggest that the present note and your reply to that effect should be regarded as placing on record the understanding of our two Governments in this matter.

Memorandum of agreement between the United States of America and Norway respecting civil administration and jurisdiction in liberated Norwegian territory. Signed May 16, 1944.
MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN NORWAY AND THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA RESPECTING THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR CIVIL ADMINISTRATION AND JURISDICTION IN NORWEGIAN TERRITORY LIBERATED BY AN ALLIED EXPEDITIONARY FORCE

May 16, 1944 [T. I.A. S. 1514]

The discussions which have taken place between the representatives of Norway and the United States of America concerning the arrangements to be made for civil administration and jurisdiction in Norwegian territory liberated by an Allied Expeditionary Force under an Allied Commander in Chief have led to agreement upon the following broad conclusions.

The agreed arrangements set out below are intended to be essentially temporary and practical and are designed to facilitate as far as possible the task of the Commander in Chief and to further our common purpose, namely, the speedy expulsion of the Germans from

Norway and the final victory of the Allies over Germany.
1. In areas affected by military operations it is necessary to contemplate a first or military phase during which the Commander in

Chief of the Expeditionary Force on land must, to the full extent

necessitated by the military situation , exercise supreme responsibility and authority.
2. As soon as , and to such extent as, in the opinion of the Com-

mander in Chief, the military situation permits, the Norwegian Gov- wegian Government.

ernment will be notified in order that it may resume the exercise of

responsibility for the civil administration , subject to such special arrangements as may be required in areas of vital importance to the

Allied forces, such as ports, lines of communication and airfields, and

without prejudice to the enjoyment by the Allied forces of such other

facilities as may be necessary for the prosecution of the war to its final conclusion.

3.

a. During the first phase the Commander in Chief will make

the fullest possible use of the advice and assistance which will be

tendered to him through Norwegian liaison officers attached to his staff for civil affairs and included in the personnel of a Norwegian military mission to be appointed by the Norwegian Government. He will also make the fullest possible use of loyal Norwegian local authorities.

b. The Norwegian liaison officers referred to in sub paragraph a above will, so far as possible, be employed as intermediaries between

the Allied military authorities and the Norwegian local authorities.

4. During the first phase the Norwegian Government will assist the Commander in Chief by reorganizing or re-establishing the Norwegian administrative and judicial services through whose collaboration the

Commander in Chief can discharge his supreme responsibility. For

this purpose the Norwegian Government will act through its repre-

sentatives on the spot, who, for practical reasons, will be included in

the Norwegian military mission referred to in sub paragraph 3a above.

5. The appointment of the Norwegian administrative and judicial

services will be effected by the competent Norwegian authorities in accordance with Norwegian law. If during the first phase ( see para-

graph 1 above) conditions should necessitate appointments in the

Norwegian administrative or judicial services, the competent repre-

sentative of the Norwegian Government will, upon the request of the Commander in Chief and after consultation with him, then appoint

the requisite officials. 6. Members of the Norwegian armed forces serving in Norwegian
units with the Allied Expeditionary Force in Norwegian territory

shall come under the exclusive jurisdiction of Norwegian courts.

Other Norwegians, who , at the time of entering Norway as members

of the Allied Expeditionary Force, are serving in conditions which

render them subject to Allied naval, military or air force law, will

not be regarded as members of the Norwegian armed forces for this

purpose. 7. In the exercise of jurisdiction over civilians, the Norwegian
Government will make the necessary arrangements for insuring the

speedy trial in the vicinity by Norwegian courts of such civilians as are alleged to have committed offenses against the persons, prop-

erty, or security of the Allied forces, without prejudice however to the

power of the Commander in Chief, if military necessity requires , to

8. Without prejudice to the provisions of paragraph 15, Allied service courts and authorities will have exclusive jurisdiction over

require special consideration and should form the subject of a separate agreement.
9. Persons thus subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of Allied service courts and authorities may, however, be arrested by the Norwegian

police for offenses against Norwegian law, and detained until they can be handed over for disposal to the appropriate Allied service au-

thority. A certificate signed by an Allied officer of field rank or its

equivalent, that the person to whom it refers belongs to one of the

classes mentioned in paragraph 8, shall be conclusive. The procedure

for handing over such persons is a matter for local arrangement.

13. The Commander in Chief shall have power to requisition billets

and supplies and make use of lands, buildings, transportation and

other services for the military needs of the forces under his command.

Requisitions will be effected where possible through Norwegian authorities and in accordance with Norwegian law. For this purpose the fullest use will be made of Norwegian liaison officers attached to the staff of the Commander in Chief.

14. The immunity from Norwegian jurisdiction and taxation resulting from paragraphs 8 and 12 will extend to such selected civilian

officials and employees of the Allied Governments present in Norway on duty in furtherance of the purposes of the Allied Expeditionary Force as may from time to time be notified by the Commander in Chief to the competent Norwegian authority.
15. Should circumstances in future be such as to require provision to be made for the exercise of jurisdiction in civil matters over nonNorwegian members of the Allied forces present in Norway, the Allied Governments concerned and the Norwegian Government will consult together as to the measures to be adopted.
16. Other questions arising as a result of the liberation of Norwegian territory by an Allied Expeditionary Force ( in particular questions relating to finance and currency and the attribution of the cost of maintaining the civil administration during the first or military phase) which are not dealt with in this agreement shall be regarded as re-

maining open and shall form the subject of further negotiation as circumstances may require.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this instrument has been executed in duplicate as of this 16th day of May, 1944, on behalf of the parties hereto under the respective authorizations hereinafter set forth.

BRUXELLES, le 1 Feb 1946

MONSIEUR LE CHARGÉ D'AFFAIRES ,

J'ai l'honneur d'accuser la réception de la lettre du 25 octobre 1945 nº 371 , par laquelle vous avez bien voulu proposer de rendre effectif, sur une base provisoire, le projet d'accord concernant l'établissement de lignes d'aviation civile , qui fait actuellement l'objet de négociations entre nos deux Gouvernements.
En attendant l'aboutissement de ces négociations et sans préjudice du résultat de celles-ci , le Gouvernement belge est également désireux de ne pas entraver l'établissement de services de transports aériens actuellement reconnus comme possibles et désirables .
En conséquence , il serait d'accord pour mettre provisoirement en vigueur ce projet , qui est d'ailleurs conforme dans ses neuf articles , à la Résolution VIII adoptée à la Conférence de Chicago, en vue de faciliter le prompt établissement des services d'aviation civile désignés ci-après :

A. Les organismes exploitants des Etats-Unis d'Amérique autorisés en vertu du présent arrangement auront le droit de survol et d'atterrissage non commercial sur le territoire belge , ainsi que le droit d'embarquer et de débarquer à Bruxelles , en trafic international , des passagers , de la poste et des marchandises sur l'itinéraire suivant :

Des Etats-Unis par l'Atlantique Nord à Londres, Bruxelles et au-delà vers l'Inde par des points intermédiaires en Europe Centrale et le Proche Orient, dans les deux directions .
B. Les organismes exploitants de Belgique autorisés en vertu du présent arrangement auront le droit de survol et d'atterrissage non commercial sur le territoire des Etats-Unis d' Amérique ainsi que le droit d'embarquer et de débarquer à New-York, en trafic international , des passagers , de la poste et des marchandises sur l'itinéraire suivant ;
de Belgique à New-York via des points intermédiaires de l'Atlantique Nord , dans les deux directions.
Bien qu'il soit reconnu que les conditions d'exploitation puissent nécessiter le changement de matériel aux escales intermédiaires, il est entendu qu'il ne pourra être usé de ce droit en vue de changer le caractère de long courrier des services spécifiés .
Avant de pouvoir entreprendre les opérations visées dans le présent arrangement, les organismes exploitants désignés par chaque Gouvernement pour exploiter les lignes spécifiées ci-dessus , pourront être

mis dans l'obligation d'obtenir à cet effet des autorités compétentes de l'autre Gouvernement , l'autorisation requise en vertu des règlements et usages généralement appliqués par ces autorités.
En attendant la conclusion d'un accord bilatéral de trafic aérien, le présent arrangement provisoire aura une durée de validité initiale de trois mois à dater du 1er. février 1946. A l'expiration de cette période , il restera en vigueur par tacite reconduction sauf dénonciation par l'un des deux Gouvernements en tout temps avec préavis d'un mois.

EXCELLENCY :

I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of Your Excellency's note of February 1 , 1946, reading as follows:

"I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of Note no . 371 , of October 25 , 1945 , by which you were good enough to propose putting into effect on a provisional basis the draft agreement for establishment of civil aviation lines, which is at present the subject of negotiations between our two Governments.
"The Belgian Government likewise is desirous of not hindering the establishment of air transport services which are actually considered possible and desirable pending conclusion of these negotiations and without prejudicing the results thereof.
"In consequence, it would agree to put this draft, which moreover conforms in its nine articles to Resolution VIII adopted by the Chicago Conference, into force provisionally, in order to facilitate the prompt establishment of the following civil air services:
A. Airline operators of the United States of America authorized under this agreement are accorded rights of transit and nontraffic stop in the territory of Belgium, as well as the right to pick up and discharge international traffic in passengers , cargo and mail at Brussels , on the following route:
The United States over the North Atlantic to London, Brussels , and thence to India via intermediate points in Central Europe and the Near East ; in both directions.

B. Airline operators of Belgium authorized under this agreement are accorded rights of transit and non-traffic stop in the territory of the United States of America, as well as the right to pick up and discharge international traffic in passengers , cargo and mail at New York, on the following route :

Belgium via intermediate points over the North Atlantic to New York ; in both directions .

"While it is recognized that operating conditions may necessitate the changing of equipment at intermediary stops, it is understood that this right cannot be availed of for the purpose of changing the long range character of the services described .
"The airline operators designated by each Government to operate the services described above may be required to qualify before the competent aeronautical authorities of the other government under the regulations and requirements normally applied by these authorities, before being permitted to engage in the operations contemplated by this agreement .

EXCELLENCY :

April 24, 1946

The Government of the United States, desirous of aiding the people of Poland in their efforts to repair war damages and to reconstruct the Polish economy, expresses its satisfaction at the successful conclusion of the negotiations concerning the opening of credits of $40,000,000 to the Provisional Government of Poland by the ExportImport Bank of Washington, D. C., and the satisfactory conclusion of arrangements for extending credits up to $ 50,000,000 for the purchase by Poland of United States surplus property held abroad.
The Government of the United States hopes that these agreements will prove to be the first step toward durable and mutually beneficial economic and financial cooperation between the Governments of the two countries. It believes, however, that such cooperation can develop fully only if
(1) a general framework is established within which economic relations between Poland and the United States can be effectively organized on the basis of principles set forth in Article VII of the Mutual Aid Agreement of July 1 , 1942 , so as to result in the elimination of all forms of discriminatory treatment in international commerce, and the reduction of tariffs and other trade barriers ;
(2) the Provisional Government of Poland is in accord with the general tenor of the "Proposals for Expansion of World Trade and Employment" recently transmitted to the Provisional Government of Poland by the Government of the United States, and undertakes together with the Government of the United States to abstain , pending the participation of the two Governments in the general international conference on trade and employment contemplated by the

EXCELLENCY : I have the honor to refer to the recent conversations between repre-

United Kingdom undertake to purchase the exportable surplus of

rice produced in Brazil from the 1943-1944 and 1944-1945 crops of the types and qualities and under the terms specified in the attached schedule, and the Government of Brazil undertakes to sell or to cause

to be sold such surplus, to be made available for shipment from month

to month during the twelve months immediately after harvesting, i . e. until April 30, 1945 and April 30, 1946 , respectively. In order to avoid deterioration through long storage the Government of Brazil, by means of full utilization of milling facilities, will make every endeavor to make available for shipment as large a proportion as

3. The Government of Brazil undertakes to take such action as
shall be necessary to limit exports of rice to those destined to the

United States of America, the United Kingdom or their respective nominees.

4. In order, however, that Brazil may maintain its normal channels of trade so far as consistent with the present emergency and to assure

equitable supplies to the other American Republics and to the French and Dutch Possessions in the Western Hemisphere, it is understood

that there is excepted from the foregoing undertakings rice to an amount sufficient to satisfy the essential needs of these countries

8. The British Ministry of Food has been designated to act as such

agency until further notice from the two Governments.

undertakes to prevent the imposition of additional or increased export

taxes and other taxes and charges on rice or freight, whether Federal ,

State or otherwise, during the term of this Agreement. 10. The Brazilian Government undertakes to give wide publicity to

such provisions of the Agreement as will provide an incentive to maxi-

ANNEX A
General Conditions Governing the Establishment of Direct Radiotelegraph Circuits
(i) The desirability of establishing any direct radio circuit between two countries is a matter involving a judgment on its merits by the Governments of both the countries concerned . It is essential that conditions, particularly economic conditions, and the requirements of the users, at both ends of a proposed circuit should be fully considered in each case.
(ii) The governing conditions for the establishment of direct radio circuits are those of traffic and service, with the expeditious disposal of traffic as the main objective .
(iii) The existence of both radio and cables is essential in the general interest of world telecommunications as a whole. Provision of direct radio circuits should therefore have regard to existing channels of communication .
(iv) It is recognised that in certain cases a circuit might be deemed necessary for political reasons.

SIR,

OCTOBER 23, 1945

On December 16, 1944 , an Agreement Relating To Air Transport Services was concluded between Denmark and the United States of

America, effective provisionally from January 1 , 1945. Acting upon instruction from my Government , I now have the honor to advise you that by Royal decree of September 29, 1945, this Air Transport Agreement has been confirmed by the Danish Government.
At the same time I beg to inform you that I have been instructed to discuss with the American authorities the following two amendments to the Agreement ( I and II ) of which No. I is proposed by the Danish Government and No. II by the American Government :

I

The Danish Government would appreciate as a matter of reciprocity to have the last lines of paragraph B in the Annex to the Air Transport Agreement amended to read as follows :
"Denmark to the United States and points beyond via immediate points ; in both directions."
II

With reference to paragraph A of the Annex to the Air Transport Agreement, the American Government has expressed a wish through the American Legation in Copenhagen that a clause be inserted at the end of the paragraph, reading as follows :
"Rights of transit and non-traffic stop are granted United States airlines in the territory of Greenland on a route between the United States and Europe."
I shall be much obliged if you will be good enough to inform me whether the American Government is prepared to conclude a revised

The Secretary of State to the Danish Minister

SIR :

DEC 5 1945

I have received your note of October 23 , 1945 in which you advise the Department that by Royal decree of September 29, 1945 the Air Transport Agreement between the United States of America and

Denmark, effective provisionally from January 1 , 1945, has been confirmed by the Danish Government.
The Department is gratified at this action, and is pleased to advise you that it considers this agreement as being definitively in force as from the date of the aforementioned Royal decree.

You also inform the Department that you have been instructed to discuss with the American authorities two amendments to the Agreement as follows.

1. A change of the last lines in Section B of the Annex amending them to read as follows :

58 Stat. 1458. 58 Stat. 1461.

"Denmark to the United States and points beyond, via intermediate points ; in both directions. "

I am pleased to inform you that the Department agrees to this change in wording suggested by the Danish Government.
You also inform the Department that the Danish Government accepts the suggestion of the American Government that a clause be inserted at the end of Section A of the Annex, the effect of which would be to grant rights of transit and non-traffic stop in Greenland to United States airlines operating between the United States and Europe. Since the first paragraph of Section A already grants these rights to United States air services operating on the route to Denmark, it is now suggested for purposes of clarity that the proposed final paragraph of Section A read as follows :
"Rights of transit and non-traffic stop with respect to Greenland are also granted to United States airlines on a route or routes between the United States and Europe."

Les forces armées allemandes, sur terre, sur mer et dan les airs, sont couplètement vaincues et ont capitulé sans conditions , et l'Allemagne , qui porte la responsabilité de la guerre , n'est désormais plus en état de résister à la volonté des Puissances victorieuses . De ce fait la capitulation sans conditions de l'Allemagne a été effectuée et l'Allemagne se trouve soumise à toutes les exigences qui peuvent actuellement ou pourraient dans l'avenir lui être imposées .
Il n'existe pas en Allemagne de Gouvernement central ou d'autorité centrale en état d'assumer la responsabilité du maintien de l'ordre , de l'administration du pays et de l'exécution des exigences des Puissances victorieuses .
Il est dans ces circonstances nécessaires , sans préjuger de toutes décisions ultérieures qui pourraient être prises au sujet de l'Allemagne , de prendre les dispositions relatives à la cessation immédiate des hostilités par les forces armées allemandes, au maintien de l'ordre en Allemagne et à l'adninistration du pays , et de proclamer les premières exigences auxquelles l'Allemagne aura l'obligation de se conformer .
Les Représentants des Commandements suprêmes de la République Française , des Etats-Unis d'Amérique , du Royaume-Uni et de l'Union des Républiques Socialistes Soviétiques , dénoanés ci-après les " Représentants Alliés " , agissant en vertu des pouvoirs qui leur sont conférés par leurs Gouvernements respectifs et dans l'intérêt des Nations Unies , font , en conséquence , la déclaration suivante :-
Le Gouvernement Provisoire de la République Française , et les Gouvernementa des Etats- Unis d'Amérique , du RoyaumeUni et de l'Union des Républiques Socialistes Soviétiques assument par les présentes l'autorité suprême à l'égard de l'Allemagne , y compris tous les pouvoirs détenus par le Gouvernement allemand, par le Haut-Commandement allemand et par tout Gouvernement ou autorité d'Etat, municipal ou local. La prise de cette autorité et de ces pouvoirs , pour les buts ci-dessus exposés , n'a pas pour effet d'annexer l'Allemagne .

A fin de evitar la falta de un instrumento que regule las relaciones comerciales entre Chile y los Estados Unidos de América, y mientras se llega a un Convenio Comercial más amplio , mi Gobierno está dispuesto a continuar extendiendo a los productos norteamericanos que se especifican en las Listas anexas a mi Nota Nº 4024 , de 30 de Julio

del año último , el mismo tratamiento que en ella se indica.La presente Nota y la respuesta de Vuestra Excelencia expresando
la aceptación de Vuestro Gobierno sobre la materia, constituirán un

nuevo Acuerdo entre ambos países, entendiéndose que el plazo de su validez será de un año a contar desde el 31 de Julio en curso, menos

que sea denunciado por cualquiera de las Altas Partes Contratantes

por una notificación escrita dada con treinta días de anticipación , o que sea reemplazado por un Acuerdo Comercial más amplio.-
El Gobierno de Chile se vale de esta oportunidad para reiterar al de Vuestra Excelencia sus deseos de activar, en lo posible, las negociaciones actuales para llegar a la pronta concertación de un Tratado de

Amistad, Comercio y Navegación más amplio y completo , que sirva en forma más eficiente al interés recíproco de ambos países.-

Santiago, July 23, 1946

MR. AMBASSADOR :

On the 30th of the current month, there will expire the Supplementary Trade Agreement effected last year by an exchange of notes on the same date, whereby the provisional agreement signed by our Governments on January 6, 1938 was amplified .
In order to avoid the lack of an instrument regulating the commercial relations between Chile and the United States of America, and pending conclusion of a more ample trade agreement, my Government is prepared to continue extending to the American products specified in the lists attached to my note no . 4024 of July 30 of last year, the same treatment as indicated therein.

This note and Your Excellency's reply stating your Government's

acceptance of its substance, will constitute a new agreement between our two countries , it being understood that the duration of its validity will be one year beginning with the 31st of the current month , unless it is denounced by either of the High Contracting Parties by written notice given thirty days in advance, or is replaced by a broader trade agreement .
The Chilean Government avails itself of this opportunity to repeat its desire to hasten the present negotiations in so far as possible, in order that agreement may be reached soon on a broader and more complete treaty of friendship , commerce and navigation which will serve more effectively the mutual interests of both countries.
I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the assurances of my highest and most distinguished consideration .

EMBASSY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
Santiago, July 30, 1946

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of Your Excellency's note of July 23, 1946 containing a proposal by the Government of the Republic of Chile to concede to the commerce of the United States of America, without compensation, reductions in the Chilean import duties on certain products as set forth in the enclosure with Your

July 30, 1945 60 STAT. ] CHILE- COMMERCIAL RELATIONS- July 23, 30, 1946
Excellency's Note No. 4024 of July 30 , 1945 , such reductions to continue in force for a further period of one year commencing on July 31 , 1946 , unless the present agreement is superseded in that time by a more comprehensive commercial agreement, it being understood, however, that the present agreement may be terminated by either Government upon the giving of thirty days' advance notice in writing.
I have the honor to assure Your Excellency that the Government of the United States of America greatly appreciates the interest of the Chilean Government in adopting measures to expand and to liberalize trade in accordance with the economic objectives of the Atlantic Charter and of the Inter-American Conference on Problems
of War and Peace , [ ' ] and is pleased to accept the proposal of the Government of Chile.
I have noted with satisfaction the desire expressed by Your Excellency's Government to expedite, in so far as may be possible , the present negotiations for a Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation and I take this opportunity to inform Your Excellency that my Government is likewise desirous of proceeding with these negotiations .
Accept, Excellency, the renewed assurances of my highest and most distinguished consideration.

SEÑOR EMBAJADOR : El Gobierno de la República de Chile consecuente con los principios
sustentados por las Naciones Unidas y de acuerdo con los objetivos económicos de la Carta del Atlántico y especialmente de la Conferencia Inter-Americana de Mexico sobre los Problemas de la Guerra y de la Paz, respecto de la reducción de los derechos aduaneros , desea adoptar medidas tendientes a intensificar el intercambio comercial con los Estados Unidos de América y demás Naciones Aliadas dentro de una política de concesiones mutuas y de estrecha cooperación.

tiempo , atendidos los estudios y procedimientos que se deben considerar, el Gobierno de Chile estima que puede adelantarse en el cumplimiento de los objetivos mencionados por medio del presente cambio de notas complementario que, ampliando el Convenio Provisional de Comercio suscrito entre ambos paises el 6 de Enero de 1938 , contempla en mejor forma los propósitos enunciados en los Acuerdos Internacionales aludidos.
El Gobierno de Chile está dispuesto , desde luego , a conceder franquicias aduaneras a los productos norteamericanos enumerados en la lista anexa, reducciones éstas que , al igual que el Convenio Provisional de Comercio de 1938 , se mantendrán vigentes hasta la celebración de un Acuerdo Comercial más comprensivo con los Estados Unidos de América y que serán de considerable y positivo beneficio para los productos de ese país que gozarán así de apreciables rebajas de derechos en numerosas partidas que son de interés en su comercio con Chile.
El Gobierno de mi país ha decidido dar el paso indicado , sin estipular compensación, en el convencimiento de que así corresponde al espíritu de franca y leal cooperación que exteriorizó la Delegación de los Estados Unidos de América durante la Conferencia de Mexico .
La presente Nota y la contestación de Vuestra Excelencia expresando la conformidad de su Gobierno con esta proposición del Gobierno de Chile, constituirá un Acuerdo entre ambos paises sobre esta materia.
Este Acuerdo regirá por el plazo de un año a menos que sea sustituido durante ese período de tiempo por un Acuerdo Comercial más comprensivo, pudiendo ser denunciado por cualquiera de los dos paises mediante una notificación de 30 dias de anticipación .
El Gobierno de Chile se vale de esta ocasión para manifestar su deseo de iniciar negociaciones con el Gobierno de Vuestra Excelencia para concertar un Tratado de Amistad , Comercio y Navegación.
Aprovecho esta oportunidad para renovar a Vuestra Excelencia las seguridades de mi más alta y distinguida consideración .

REPUBLIC OF CHILE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCIAL POLICY

C 4-121.413 No. 004024

SANTIAGO, July 30, 1945.

MR. AMBASSADOR : The Government of the Republic of Chile, following the principles
upheld by the United Nations and in accordance with the economic objectives of the Atlantic Charter and especially of the InterAmerican Conference of Mexico City on Problems of War and Peace ['] with respect to the reduction of customs duties, wishes to adopt measures to intensify commercial exchange with the United States of America and other Allied Nations within a policy of mutual concessions and of close cooperation.
In view of the fact that the conclusion of a more comprehensive Commercial Agreement with the United States of America will still require a certain amount of time, in consequence of the studies and procedures which must be considered , the Government of Chile believes that it may make progress toward the fulfilment of the abovementioned objectives by means of the present supplementary exchange of notes which, amplifying the Provisional Commercial Agreement concluded by the two countries on January 6, 1938 , contemplates better the proposals expressed in the referred-to International Agreements .
The Government of Chile is disposed , immediately, to grant customs concessions to the United States products enumerated in the attached list , these being reductions which, like the Provisional Commercial Agreement of 1938 , will remain in force until the conclusion of a more comprehensive Commercial Agreement with the United States of America and which will be of considerable and positive benefit with respect to the products of that country which will thus enjoy appreciable reductions in customs duties as regards numerous items which are of interest in its trade with Chile.
The Government of my country has decided to take the indicated step , without stipulating compensation, in the conviction that it will
thus respond to the spirit of frank and loyal cooperation displayed by the Delegation of the United States of America during the Mexico City Conference.

countries by giving 30 days' advance notice.

The Government of Chile takes this occasion to express its desire

to initiate negotiations with Your Excellency's Government to conclude

I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the

assurances of my highest and most distinguished consideration .

its underlying principles . To the extent, therefore, that this agree-

ment is inconsistent with the exchange of notes of November 22nd and December 20th , 1944, it shall be regarded as superseding them. 3. It is agreed that for the sum of $ 12,000,000.00 (U. S.) the United

VIII
ASISTENCIA RECIPROCA Y SOLIDARIDAD AMERICANA
Los Gobiernos representados en la Conferencia Interamericana sobre Problemas de la Guerra y de la Paz, CONSIDERANDO :
Que los pueblos americanos, animados de profundo amor a la justicia, permanecen sinceramente adictos a los postulados del Derecho Internacional ;
Que son sus deseos que tales postulados, no obstante las difíciles circunstancias actuales, prevalezcan todavía con más fuerza en las futuras relaciones internacionales ;
Que las Conferencias Interamericanas han proclamado más de una vez ciertos principios fundamentales , pero que éstos deben ser reafirmados en el momento en que se trata de reconstruir las bases jurídicas de la comunidad de naciones:
Que la nueva situación del mundo hace cada vez más imperiosa la unión y la solidaridad de los pueblos americanos para la defensa de sus derechos y el mantenimiento de la paz internacional ;
Que los Estados americanos han venido incorporando a su Derecho Internacional, desde 1890 , por medio de Convenciones, Resoluciones y Declaraciones, las normas siguientes:
a) La proscripción de la conquista territorial y el desconocimiento de toda adquisición hecha por la violencia (Primera Conferencia Internacional Americana , 1890 ) ;
b) La condenación de la intervención de un Estado en los asuntos internos o externos de otro (Séptima Conferencia Internacional

1832

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [ 60 STAT.
Americana, 1933 , y Conferencia Interamericana de Consolidación de la Paz, 1936 ) ; c) El reconocimiento de que toda guerra o amenaza de guerra afecta directa o indirectamente a todos los pueblos civilizados y pone en peligro los grandes principios de libertad y de justicia que constituyen el ideal de América y la norma de su política internacional (Conferencia Interamericana de Consolidación de la Paz , 1936 ) ; d) El sistema de las consultas mutuas para buscar un procedimiento de cooperación pacifista , en caso de guerra o amenaza de guerra entre países americanos (Conferencia Interamericana de Consolidación de la Paz , 1936 ) ; e) El reconocimiento de que todo acto susceptible de perturbar la paz de América afecta a todas las naciones americanas y a cada una de ellas y justifica la iniciación de los procedimientos de consulta (Conferencia Interamericana de Consolidación de la Paz , 1936) ; f) La adopción de la vía de la conciliación , del arbitraje amplio , o de la justicia internacional, para resolver toda diferencia o disputa entre las naciones de América, cualesquiera que sean su naturaleza y su origen (Conferencia Interamericana de Consolidación de la Paz, 1936 ) ; g) El reconocimiento de que el respeto de la personalidad , soberanía e independencia de cada Estado americano constituye la esencia del orden internacional, amparado por la solidaridad continental manifestada históricamente y sostenida por declaraciones y tratados vigentes (Octava Conferencia Internacional Americana, 1938) ; h) La afirmación de que el respeto y la fiel observancia de los tratados constituyen norma indispensable para el desarrollo de las relaciones pacíficas entre los Estados y que ellos sólo podrán ser revisados mediante acuerdo de las partes (Declaración de Principios Americanos , Octava Conferencia Internacional Americana, 1938 ) ; i) La proclamación de su interés común y de la determinación de hacer efectiva su solidaridad, coordinando sus respectivas voluntades mediante el procedimiento de consulta, y usando los medios que en cada caso aconsejen las circunstancias, en cualquier ocasión en que la paz, la seguridad o la integridad territorial de las Repúblicas americanas se vean amenazadas por actos de cualquier naturaleza que puedan menoscabarlas (Declaración de Lima, Octava Conferencia Internacional Americana, 1938) ; j ) La declaración de que todo atentado de un Estados no americano contra la integridad territorial o la inviolabilidad del territorio, contra la soberanía o la independencia política de un Estado americano, será considerado como un acto de agresión contra todos los Estados americanos (Declaración XV de la Segunda Reunión de Consulta de los Ministros de Relaciones Exteriores, La Habana, 1940) ;

60 STAT. ] INTER-AMERICAN--ACT OF CHAPULTEPEC- MAR. 8, 1945

Que la seguridad y solidaridad del Continente se afectan lo mismo cuando se produce un acto de agresión contra cualquiera de las naciones americanas por parte de un Estado no americano, como cuando el acto de agresión proviene de un Estado americano contra otro u otros Estados americanos,

FINAL ACT OF THE
INTER-AMERICAN CONFERENCE ON PROBLEMS OF WAR AND PEACE
PURSUANT to the invitation extended on January 10, 1945 , by the Government of the United Mexican States , the Delegations of the countries enumerated below met in Mexico City on February 21 , 1945. The order of precedence was determined by a drawing of lots on February 21 , in conformity with Article 5, paragraph (g) , of the Regulations of the Conference:
VIII
RECIPROCAL ASSISTANCE AND AMERICAN SOLIDARITY
WHEREAS : The peoples of the Americas, animated by a profound love of justice, remain sincerely devoted to the principles of international law; It is their desire that such principles, notwithstanding the present difficult circumstances, prevail with even greater force in future international relations ; The inter-American conferences have repeatedly proclaimed certain fundamental principles, but these must be reaffirmed at a time when the juridical bases of the community of nations are being re-established ; The new situation in the world makes more imperative than ever the union and solidarity of the American peoples , for the defense of their rights and the maintenance of international peace ; The American states have been incorporating in their international law, since 1890, by means of conventions, resolutions and declarations, the following principles:
a) The proscription of territorial conquest and the non-recognition of all acquisitions made by force (First International Conference of American States, 1890) ;
b) The condemnation of intervention by one State in the internal or external affairs of another (Seventh International Conference of American States, 1933 , [ ] and Inter-American Conference for the Maintenance of Peace, 1936) ; [2]

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [ 60 STAT.
c) The recognition that every war or threat of war affects directly or indirectly all civilized peoples, and endangers the great principles of liberty and justice which constitute the American ideal and the standard of American international policy (InterAmerican Conference for the Maintenance of Peace, 1936) ;
d) The system of mutual consultation in order to find means of peaceful cooperation in the event of war or threat of war between American countries (Inter-American Conference for the Maintenance of Peace, 1936 ) ;
e) The recognition that every act susceptible of disturbing the peace of America affects each and every one of the American nations and justifies the initiation of the procedure of consultation (InterAmerican Conference for the Maintenance of Peace, 1936 ) .
f) The adoption of conciliation, unrestricted arbitration, or the application of international justice, in the solution of any difference or dispute between American nations , whatever its nature or origin (Inter-American Conference for the Maintenance of Peace, 1936 ) ;
g) The recognition that respect for the personality, sovereignty and independence of each American State constitutes the essence of international order sustained by continental solidarity , which historically has been expressed and sustained by declarations and treaties in force (Eighth International Conference of American States, 1938 ) ; [ ']
h) The affirmation that respect for and the faithful observance of treaties constitute the indispensable rule for the development of peaceful relations between States, and that treaties can only be revised by agreement of the contracting parties (Declaration of American Principles, Eighth International Conference of American States, 1938) ;
i) The proclamation that, in case the peace, security or territorial integrity of any American republic is threatened by acts of any nature that may impair them, they proclaim their common concern and their determination to make effective their solidarity, coordinating their respective sovereign wills by means of the procedure of consultation, using the measures which in each case the circumstances may make advisable (Declaration of Lima, Eighth International Conference of American States, 1938) ;
j ) The declaration that any attempt on the part of a nonAmerican state against the integrity or inviolability of the territory, the sovereignty or the political independence of an American State shall be considered as an act of aggression against all the American States (Declaration XV of the Second Meeting of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Habana , 1940) ;[²] The furtherance of these principles , which the American States have constantly practised in order to assure peace and solidarity

60 STAT. ] UNITED KINGDOM-FINANCIAL AGREEMENT- DEC. 6, 1945

1841

Financial agreement between the United States of America and the United Kingdom. Signed at Washington December 6, 1945; effective July 15, 1946.
FINANCIAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE UNITED KINGDOM

December 6, 1945 [T. I. A. S. 1545]

It is hereby agreed between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland as follows:

1. Effective date of the Agreement . The effective date of this Agreement shall be the date on which the Government of the United States notifies the Government of the United Kingdom that the Congress of the United States has made available the funds necessary to extend to the Government of the United Kingdom the line of credit in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.
2. Line of credit . The Government of the United States will extend to the Government of the United Kingdom a line of credit of $3,750,000,000 which may be drawn upon at any time between the effective date of this Agreement and December 31 , 1951 , inclusive .
3. Purpose of the line of credit. The purpose of the line of credit is to facilitate purchases by the United Kingdom of goods and services in the United States , to assist the United Kingdom to meet transitional postwar deficits in its current balance of payments , to help the United Kingdom to maintain adequate reserves of gold and dollars, and to assist the Government of the United Kingdom to assume the obligations of multilateral trade , as defined in this and other agreements.
4. Amortization and interest.

Post, p. 1845.

(i) The amount of the line of credit drawn by December 31 , 1951 , shall be repaid in 50 annual installments beginning on December 31 ,
1951 , with interest at the rate of 2 percent per annum. Interest for the year 1951 shall be computed on the amount outstanding on December 31 , 1951 , and for each year thereafter, interest shall be computed on the amount outstanding on January 1 of each such year.
Forty-nine annual installments of principal repayments and interest shall be equal, calculated at the rate of $31,823,000 for each $ 1,000 ,000,000 of the line of credit drawn by December 31 , 1951 , and the fiftieth annual installment shall be at the rate of $31,840,736.65 for each such $ 1,000,000,000 . Each installment shall consist of the full amount of the interest due and the remainder of the installment shall be the principal to be repaid in that year. Payments required by this section are subject to the provisions of section 5.

1842

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [ 60 Stat.
(ii) The Government of the United Kingdom may accelerate repayment of the amount drawn under this line of credit.
5. Waiver of interest payments. In any year in which the Government of the United Kingdom requests the Government of the United · States to waive the amount of the interest due in the installment of
that year, the Government of the United States will grant the waiver if:
(a) the Government of the United Kingdom finds that a waiver is necessary in view of the present and prospective conditions of international exchange and the level of its gold and foreign exchange reserves and
(b) the International Monetary Fund certifies that the income of the United Kingdom from home-produced exports plus its net income from invisible current transactions in its balance of payments was on the average over the five preceding calendar years less than the average annual amount of United Kingdom imports during 1936-8 , fixed at £866 million, as such figure may be adjusted for changes in the price level of these imports. Any amount in excess of £43,750,000 released or paid in any year on account of sterling balances accumulated to the credit of overseas governments , monetary authorities and banks before the effective date of this Agreement shall be regarded as a capital transaction and therefore shall not be included in the above calculation of the net income from invisible current transactions for that year. If waiver is requested for an interest payment prior to that due in 1955 , the average income shall be computed for the calendar years from 1950 through the year preceding that in which the request is made. 6. Relation of this line of credit to other obligations.
(i) It is understood that any amounts required to discharge obligations of the United Kingdom to third countries outstanding on the effective date of this Agreement will be found from resources other than this line of credit.
(ii) The Government of the United Kingdom will not arrange any long-term loans from governments within the British Commonwealth after December 6, 1945 , and before the end of 1951 on terms more favorable to the lender than the terms of this line of credit.
(iii) Waiver of interest will not be requested or allowed under section 5 in any year unless the aggregate of the releases or payments in that year of sterling balances accumulated to the credit of overseas governments, monetary authorities and banks (except in the case of colonial dependencies) before the effective date of this Agreement is reduced proportionately , and unless interest payments due in that year on loans referred to in (ii) above are waived . The proportionate reduction of the releases or payments of sterling balances shall be calculated in relation to the aggregate released and paid in the most recent year in which waiver of interest was not requested.
(iv) The application of the principles set forth in this section shall be the subject of full consultation between the two governments as occasion may arise.

7. Sterling area exchange arrangements . The Government of the United Kingdom will complete arrangements as early as practicable and in any case not later than one year after the effective date of this Agreement, unless in exceptional cases a later date is agreed upon after consultation , under which immediately after the completion of such arrangements the sterling receipts from current transactions of all sterling area countries (apart from any receipts arising out of military expenditure by the Government of the United Kingdom prior to December 31 , 1948, to the extent to which they are treated by agreement with the countries concerned on the same basis as the balances accumulated during the war) will be freely available for current transactions in any currency area without discrimination ; with the result that any discrimination arising from the so-called sterling area dollar pool will be entirely removed and that each member of the sterling area will have its current sterling and dollar receipts at its free disposition for current transactions anywhere.
8. Other exchange arrangements .
(i) The Government of the United Kingdom agrees that after the effective date of this Agreement it will not apply exchange controls in such a manner as to restrict (a) payments or transfers in respect of products of the United States permitted to be imported into the United Kingdom or other current transactions between the two countries or (b) the use of sterling balances to the credit of residents of the United States arising out of current transactions. Nothing in this paragraph (i) shall affect the provisions of Article VII of the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund when those Articles have come into force .
(ii) The Governments of the United States and the United Kingdom agree that not later than one year after the effective date of this Agreement, unless in exceptional cases a later date is agreed upon after consultation, they will impose no restrictions on payments and transfers for current transactions. The obligations of this paragraph (ii) shall not apply:
(a) to balances of third countries and their nationals accumulated before this paragraph (ii) becomes effective ; or
(b) to restrictions imposed in conformity with the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund , provided that the Governments of the United Kingdom and the United States will not continue to invoke the provisions of Article XIV, Section 2 of those Articles after this paragraph (ii) becomes effective, unless in exceptional cases after consultation they agree otherwise ; or
(c) to restrictions imposed in connection with measures designed to uncover and dispose of assets of Germany and Japan. (iii) This section and section 9, which are in anticipation of more comprehensive arrangements by multilateral agreement, shall operate until December 31 , 1951 . 9. Import arrangements. If either the Government of the United States or the Government of the United Kingdom imposes or maintains

Ante, p. 1410.

quantitative import restrictions, such restrictions shall be administered
on a basis which does not discriminate against imports from the other country in respect of any product ; provided that this undertaking shall not apply in cases in which (a) its application would have the effect of preventing the country imposing such restrictions from utilizing, for the purchase of needed imports, inconvertible currencies accumulated up to December 31 , 1946 , or (b) there may be special necessity for the country imposing such restrictions to assist, by measures not involving a substantial departure from the general rule of non-discrimination , a country whose economy has been disrupted by war, or (c) either government imposes quantitative restrictions having equivalent effect to any exchange restrictions which that government is authorized to impose in conformity with Article VII of the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund. The provisions of this section shall become effective as soon as practicable but not later than December 31 , 1946 .
10. Accumulated sterling balances .

(i) The Government of the United Kingdom intends to make agreements with the countries concerned , varying according to the circumstances of each case, for an early settlement covering the sterling balances accumulated by sterling area and other countries prior to such settlement (together with any future receipts arising out of military expenditure by the Government of the United Kingdom to the extent to which they are treated on the same basis by agreement with the countries concerned) . The settlements with the sterling area countries will be on the basis of dividing these accumulated balances into three categories (a) balances to be released at once and convertible into any currency for current transactions , (b) balances to be similarly released by installments over a period of years beginning in 1951 , and (c) balances to be adjusted as a contribution to the settlement of war and postwar indebtedness and in recognition of the benefits which the countries concerned might be expected to gain from such a settlement. The Government of the United Kingdom will make every endeavor to secure the early completion of these arrangements .
(ii) In consideration of the fact that an important purpose of the present line of credit is to promote the development of multilateral trade and facilitate its early resumption on a non-discriminatory basis, the Government of the United Kingdom agrees that any sterling balances released or otherwise available for current payments will , not later than one year after the effective date of this Agreement unless in special cases a later date is agreed upon after consultation, be freely available for current transactions in any currency area without discrimination .

100.-El anteproyecto de Pacto deberá proveer al fortalecimiento del sistema americano sobre las bases de esta resolución y con la creación de nuevos órganos o la eliminación y adaptación de los actuales , precisando sus funciones y su coordinación entre sí y con la organización mundial.
El mismo anteproyecto atenderá a la necesidad de acelerar la consolidación y extensión de los instrumentos interamericanos de paz ya existentes y a la simplificación y mejoramiento del organismo de paz interamericano ; a este fin , el Consejo Directivo de la Unión Panamericana deberá utilizar los servicios del Comité Jurídico Interamericano. Asimismo , el anteproyecto procurará la consolidación y simplificación de todos los demás instrumentos interamericanos , con el propósito de que su acción sea más efectiva.

Duties of committee .

1. Inspect new installations or changes in existing facilities

prior to regular operation to insure that adequate provision is made to prevent radiation toward other countries in

excess of the acceptable maximum . 2. Investigate whenever observed interference indicates the

possibility of maladjustments of radio transmitting equipment , and recommend adjustments or modifications to insure that the specified radiation in pertinent directions is not exceeded .

3. Investigate whenever observed interference indicates the

possibility of other maladjustments of transmitting equipment resulting in objectionable interference from causes such as excessive frequency deviation, excessive modulation , spurious emissions , or other causes and to recommend all necessary adjustments or modifications to eliminate such interference .
C. Upon receipt of a notification for construction of a new statio.n or changes in facilities of an existing station in another country, any

1883

SEGUNDA CONFERENCIA REGIONAL NORTEAMERICANA DE RADIODIFUSIÓN CONVENIO INTERINO-ANEXO 3
Comité Regional Norteamericano de Ingeniería de Radiodifusión
A. Los representantes ante este Comité serán nombrados por sus Gobiernos respectivos , bajo las condiciones y por los períodos que cada uno señale . La primera reunión de este Comité será convocada para celebrarse antes del primero de junio de 1946 por el representante de los Estados Unidos de América, con el fin de elegir un Presidente y de adoptar las reglas de práctica y procedimiento que deben seguirse para el desarrollo de las funciones que se especifican más adelante. Estas reglas incluirán requisitos detallados para los métodos de mediciones y para otros asuntos de importancia para el Comité . Las reglas serán distribuídas entre los Gobiernos interesados .
B. Cada vez que un Gobierno signatario o adherido a este Convenio lo solicite, el Comité llevará a cabo las siguientes funciones:
1. Inspeccionar nuevas instalaciones o cambios en las existentes, con anticipación al comienzo de su operación regular, para asegurar que se han tomado medidas adecuadas tendientes a impedir una radiación hacia otros países que sea superior al máximo aceptable .
2. Investigar, cuando la interferencia observada indique la posibilidad de malos ajustes del equipo transmisor de radio , y recomendar ajustes o modificaciones para asegurar que no se exceda la radiación especificada en las direcciones que sean del caso.
3. Investigar, cuando la interferencia observada indique la posibilidad de malos ajustes del equipo transmisor de radio que den por resultado interferencia objetable motivada por excesiva desviación de frecuencia, excesiva modulación , emisiones espurias u otras causas y recomendar los ajustes o modificaciones necesarios para eliminar dicha interferencia.
C. Al recibo de una notificación sobre la construcción de una nueva estación o de cambios a las existentes en otro país, cualquier gobierno que la reciba puede solicitar que, con anterioridad a la operación regular, se lleve a cabo una inspección por parte del Comité Regional Norteamericano de Ingeniería de Radiodifusión . Al aproximarse la terminación de la construcción , pero con anterioridad a su operación, el gobierno del país en donde esté ubicada la estación notificará al gobierno que solicita la inspección , que la instalación está lista para ese objeto. Los representantes de estos Gobiernos ante el Comité de Ingeniería harán entonces arreglos inmediatos para la inspección de la instalación.
D. Cuando cualquier gobierno signatario o adherido a este Convenio tenga alguna razón para creer que una interferencia superior a la permitida por este Convenio está siendo producida a una estación

1884

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [ 60 STAT.
ubicada en su país, como consecuencia de la operación de una estación situada en otro país signatario o adherido al Convenio, dicho gobierno notificará a su representante ante el Comité Regional Norteamericano de Ingeniería de Radiodifusión y al gobierno del país en el cual esté situada la estación señalada como interferente, que hay razón para creer que se está causando interferencia excesiva y definirá el carácter general de tal interferencia. Al recibo del aviso , el gobierno al cual se dirige lo turnará a su representante en el Comité. Dentro de un plazo de diez días, los representantes interesados del Comité deberán reunirse en el lugar de ubicación de la estación señalada como interferente y realizarán aquellas mediciones que les parezcan necesarias para determinar hechos materiales que sostengan los puntos en que se basa la queja.
E. Cuando el gobierno que solicite una inspección o investigación , o cuando el gobierno de un país señalado para efectuar una inspección o investigación, no tenga un representante ante el Comité Regional Norteamericano de Ingeniería de Radiodifusión , ese gobierno designará un representante ante el Comité que actúe para el caso particular. En la eventualidad de que ninguno de los dos gobiernos esté representado en el Comité, ambos designarán representantes ante dicho Comité para tomar parte en la inspección o investigación solicitada.
F. Al efectuar mediciones de intensidad de campo o inspecciones, los representantes ante el Comité se regirán por las normas de buena ingeniería aceptadas por el Comité.
G. Cada representante ante el Comité deberá ser provisto individualmente por su gobierno de los elementos apropiados para el equipo destinado a mediciones de radio , o de los aparatos debidamente calibrados , de acuerdo con normas mutuamente aceptables .
H. Cuando el examen demuestre que la construcción a que se refiere el párrafo C de este Artículo está de acuerdo con la notificación, y que se han tomado medidas para la protección , de conformidad con la misma notificación, el Comité lo informará así al gobierno del país en el cual esté ubicada la estación y, al mismo tiempo , comunicará este informe al gobierno o gobiernos que solicitaron el examen. Cuando el examen indique que la construcción no está de acuerdo con la notificación, o que no se han tomado medidas para la protección conforme a la notificación, el Comité rendirá informe en ese sentido a los gobiernos, juntamente con las recomendaciones relativas a cambios de construcción, modificación o ajustes de circuitos que sea necesario efectuar para cumplir completamente con la notificación.
I. Cuando se hayan hecho mediciones como consecuencia de una queja de un gobierno signatario o adherido al Convenio , deberán comunicarse inmediatamente a los gobiernos interesados los resultados de dichas mediciones, con las recomendaciones de los representantes ante el Comité.
J. Al recibo de un informe en el sentido de que la inspección de la instalación demuestra que no se han tomado medidas adecuadas para evitar radiaciones superiores al máximo aceptado , juntamente con recomendaciones acerca de las medidas necesarias para la corrección, el gobierno del país en donde esté ubicada la instalación dará pasos

60 STAT.] NORTH AMERICAN- REGIONAL BROADCASTING-FEB. 25, 1946
encaminados a que las correcciones o ajustes necesarios se lleven a cabo con anterioridad a la operación de la instalación.
K. Al recibo de un informe que indique que la interferencia investigada es , en efecto , excesiva, el gobierno del país en el cual esté ubicada la estación interferente tomará inmediatamente medidas tendientes a la eliminación de dicha interferencia. Si la interferencia encontrada por el Comité no puede ser eliminada dentro del término de diez días mediante ajustes del equipo , deberá reducirse la potencia de la estación interferente en la medida que sea necesaria para eliminar dicha interferencia.
L. Cuando los representantes de los gobiernos ante el Comité no estén de acuerdo en cuando al informe o las recomendaciones relacionadas con la inspección de instalaciones nuevas o modificadas , o sobre la investigación de una queja relativa a interferencia, cada representante ante el Comité rendirá un informe completo que cubra todos los hechos materiales con respecto a los asuntos sometidos a su consideración. Incluirá en él aquellas recomendaciones que estime apropiadas, y lo transmitirá inmediatamente a los gobiernos interesados . Se enviarán copias de ambos informes al Comité en pleno . Éste revisará el caso y conducirá las investigaciones adicionales que estime necesarias y después hará conocer sus conclusiones y recomendaciones a los gobiernos donde se encuentren ubicadas las estaciones relacionadas con el caso. Al recibo de estas recomendaciones , el gobierno del país en el que se encuentren ubicadas las estaciones concernientes , dará los pasos necesarios para cumplir las recomendaciones del Comité. Si la interferencia comprobada por el Comité no puede ser eliminada dentro de un plazo de diez días mediante ajustes del equipo , la potencia de la estación interferente deberá ser reducida en la medida que sea necesaria para eliminar dicha interferencia.
CERTIFICO : que lo que antecede es una copia fiel y exacta del Convenio Interino (Modus Vivendi) concertado en la Segunda Conferencia Regional Norteamericana de Radiodifusión para regular el uso de la banda normal de radiodifusión en la Región Norteamericana, reunida en Washington, D.C. del cuatro al veinticinco de febrero de mil novecientos cuarenta y seis, y firmado en Washington el día veinticinco de febrero de mil novecientos cuarenta y seis en dos originales redactados en los idiomas castellano e inglés, los cuales están depositados en los archivos del Gobierno de Cuba.

The three Foreign Secretaries exchanged views with regard to the situation in China.

He stated that American forces would be withdrawn just as soon as this responsibility was discharged or the Chinese Government was in a position to discharge the responsibility without the assistance of American forces.
The two Foreign Secretaries were in complete accord as to the desirability of withdrawal of Soviet and American forces from China at the earliest practicable moment consistent with the discharge of their obligations and responsibilities.

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [ 60 STAT.
V. Rumania.
The three Governments are prepared to give King Michael the advice for which he has asked in his letter of August 21 , 1945, on the broadening of the Rumanian Government. The King should be advised that one member of the National Peasant Party and one member of the Liberal Party should be included in the Government. The Commission referred to below shall satisfy itself that
(a) they are truly representative members of the groups of the Parties not represented in the Government ;
(b) they are suitable and will work loyally with the Government. The three Governments take note that the Rumanian Government thus reorganized should declare that free and unfettered elections will be held as soon as possible on the basis of universal and secret ballot. All democratic and anti-fascist parties should have the right to take part in these elections and to put forward candidates. The reorganized Government should give assurances concerning the grant of freedom of the press, speech, religion and association. A. Y. Vyshinski , Mr. Harriman, and Sir A. Clark Kerr are authorized as a Commission to proceed to Bucharest immediately to consult with King Michael and members of the present Government with a view to the execution of the above-mentioned tasks. As soon as these tasks are accomplished and the required assurances have been received, the Government of Rumania, with which the Soviet Government maintains diplomatic relations, will be recognized by the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Kingdom. [ ¹]
VI.
Bulgaria
It is understood by the three Governments that the Soviet Government takes upon itself the mission of giving firendly advice to the Bulgarian Government with regard to the desirability of the inclusion in the Bulgarian Government of the Fatherland Front, now being formed, of an additional two representatives of other democratic groups, who (a ) are truly representative of the groups of the parties which are not participating in the Government, and ( b ) are really suitable and will work loyally with the Government.
As soon as the Governments of the United States of America and the United Kingdom are convinced that this friendly advice has been accepted by the Bulgarian Government and the said additional representatives have been included in its body, the Government of the United States and the Government of the United Kingdom will recognize the Bulgarian Government, with which the Government of the Soviet Union already has diplomatic relations.

BRITISH EMBASSY,

Ref: 826/8/45

WASHINGTON, D. C., May 7th, 1945.

DEAR MR. GREW,

With reference to recent conversations which have been held

between this Embassy and the State Department I now enclose a memorandum entitled "Memorandum relating to the use and disposal of United Nations vessels captured or found in the course of operations for the liberation of Europe" .

2. It is the understanding of His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom that the United States Government are willing to apply the principles of the annexed memorandum to vessels of all the United Nations on a reciprocal basis and, with this end in view, will enter into similar agreements with all other United Nations willing to do so and will further take such steps as may be necessary

to insure that claims in the nature of prize salvage will not be advanced in the United States courts against British vessels recovered in the

course of the operations covered by the memorandum or against other vessels so recovered being vessels of other United Nations entering into similar arrangements. I take this opportunity of recalling to your attention the Prize Salvage Act, 1944, whereby His Majesty's Government took power to control and prevent prize salvage claims. 3. On these understandings and with these expressions of intent the present memorandum meets with the approval of His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom . If it likewise meets with the

approval of the United States Government, this note, together with your reply, indicating such approval and the concurrence of the Government of the United States, will be regarded as constituting an

agreement between the two Governments. I suggest that the agreement should be regarded as being in effect from the 22nd October, 1943 .

4. Similar notes are being exchanged by His Majesty's Government with the representatives of the Norwegian , Netherlands, Belgian and

1910

Greek Governments in London , and also with the representative of the French Provisional Government.
I have the honour to be, with the highest consideration , Sir, Your most obedient, humble servant, (for the Ambassador) JOHN BALFOUR.
The Honourable JOSEPH C. GREW,
Acting Secretary of State, Department of State, Washington, D. C.

5. The Commander-in-Chief will not enter into any general Agree- Chartering of U. N. vessels.
ment even of a temporary character dealing with the chartering of

groups of United Nations vessels with any Authorities he may find

in liberated or captured territories . Any such matters will be dealt

with by the Shipping Authorities of the United Nations . The ques-

tion as to the time at which it may be appropriate to transfer the

primary responsibility for dealing with such vessels from the Com-

mander-in-Chief to the Shipping Authorities of the United Nations will be dealt with according to the course of the operations .

PART II.

Arrangements to be made for the disposal of United Nations vessels captured or found in the area of operations .
1. (a) The general principle is recognised that the Government of each United Nation shall subject to the provisions of Part I of this Memorandum ultimately be entitled to take over and dispose of, as it thinks fit, vessels belonging to that State. Vessels will be treated as belonging to a State

General principle.

(i) if they were at the time when they fell into the hands of the enemy registered in the territory of that State;
(ii) if at the time when they fell into the hands of the enemy they had the right to fly the flag of that State whether or not formally registered in its territory ;
(iii) if they were built for or acquired by or by any national of that State and registered in its territory (if liable to registration) after the occupation of its territory by Germany or her Allies.

(b) This general principle will apply irrespective of the place of capture or of the constitution or nationality of the United Nations

force effecting the actual capture and of the flag which the vessel

may be flying at the time when captured or found . Thus, if in a

Norwegian harbour there were captured a formerly British vessel ,

a formerly Norwegian vessel and a formerly Netherlands vessel,

then, subject to the provisions of Part I of this Memorandum, the

first would ultimately be handed over to the United Kingdom Govern-

ment, the second to the Norwegian Government and the third to the

Netherlands Government, even though the forces actually capturing

them were not British, Norwegian or Netherlands , but belonging to

some other United Nations nationality .
2. The following additional principles are recognised and accepted in respect of any United Nations vessels captured or found in the area of operations :-

Additional ciples.

prin-

(a) The vessels concerned will be handed back to the Government of the United Nation concerned and not to individual nationals of the

1912

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [ 60 STAT.

United Nations who were the original owners . It will be for the Government of the United Nation concerned to make the necessary
arrangements with its own nationals as regards the ultimate ownership of any such vessels.
(b) The Governments of each United Nation will , in respect of any vessel handed over to it under the terms of this Memorandum :-

(i) make the vessel available for the common purposes of the United Nations in accordance with the arrangements then existing ;
(ii) accept responsibility for all liabilities in respect of the vessel and

(iii) indemnify the other United Nations Governments concerned

against any claims made against them or any one or more of

them arising out of the handing over of the vessel.

Vessels placed in a

Prize Court.

(c) Some United Nations vessels have been placed by the enemy

in a Prize Court. If such vessels are captured or found, some form

of prize proceedings will be required to divest the enemy of their title and to revest it in the Governments of the United Nations concerned .

The necessary proceedings will be brought in the Prize Court of the

State to which the ship is to be ultimately returned , or, failing that, in a Prize Court of the State of which the Commander-in-Chief is a

national, but action in the latter Prize Court would be without prejudice to the operation of the general principle as to return stated in sub-paragraph 1 of Part II above . Except in these cases Prize Court proceedings will only be taken if in any particular instance immediate action is necessary to bring a vessel into service.

(d) There may be cases in which it is subsequently proved that the true owner of a particular vessel is a State or National of a State other than that in which the vessel is registered , or that parties who

are not nationals of the State of registration hold equities in the

vessel or the right to possession thereof. In such cases, it is under-

Ante, p. 1911.

stood that Allied Governments to whom a vessel has been transferred in accordance with Article 1 of Part II of this Memorandum have by

such transfer acquired custody only and will release the vessel or

Vessels for which an indemnity has been paid.

make such other arrangements as may be necessary in the circumstances .
(e) In the case of vessels in respect of which total losses have been paid by underwriters , the return to a Government under the arrange-

ments agreed in this Memorandum wll be subject to the safeguarding

of any rights which underwriters may have. Thus, when the owner of a vessel whether a United Nations Government or a National of a

United Nations Government, has been indemnified by the underwriters, the turning over of a vessel to that Government without taking into account such indemnification , would be in the nature of a gift and in such circumstances appropriate equitable adjustments will be made between the Governments concerned .

EXCELLENCY :
I have the honor to refer to your note of May 7, 1945 (reference 826/8/45) and to previous communications regarding the disposition to be made of vessels recaptured from the enemy in the European theater of operations and formerly belonging to one of the United Nations or to its nationals. With your note was enclosed a memorandum entitled "Memorandum relating to the use and disposal of United Nations vessels captured or found in the course of operations for the liberation of Europe".
In your note it is stated that His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom understands that the Government of the United States of America is willing to apply the principles of that memorandum to vessels of all the United Nations on a reciprocal basis and, with this end in view, will enter into similar agreements with all other United Nations willing to do so, and will further take such steps as may be necessary to insure that claims in the nature of prize salvage will not be advanced in the United States courts against British vessels

recaptured in the course of the operations covered by the memorandum or against other vessels so recovered being vessels of the other United Nations entering into similar arrangements. In this connection you call attention to the British Prize Salvage Act, 1944.
You further state that "on these understandings and with these expressions of intent the present memorandum meets with the approval of His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom ". You add that if it likewise meets with the approval of the Government of the United States of America , your note, together with the reply indicating such approval and concurrence by the Government of the United States of America, will be regarded as constituting an agreement between the two countries. You further suggest that the agreement should be regarded as being in effect from October 22, 1943 .
I have the honor to inform you that the Government of the United States of America approves the memorandum in question and concurs in the understandings expressed in your note, and will apply the principles embodied in the memorandum, on a reciprocal basis, to British vessels and to the vessels of other members of the United Nations which enter into similar agreements with the United States of America.
In accordance with the suggestion made in your note, that note and the present note in reply will be regarded as constituting an agreement between the Government of the United States of America and His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom, which will be regarded as being in effect from October 22 , 1943.
In view of the present agreement in the case of British vessels , the Government of the United States of America undertakes , on a reciprocal basis, to take such steps as may be necessary to insure that claims in the nature of prize salvage will not be advanced in the United States courts against British vessels recovered in the course of the operations covered by the memorandum. In case similar agreements are concluded by the United States of America with other members of the United Nations, the United States of America will also undertake on the basis of reciprocity to take such steps as may be necessary to insure that claims in the nature of prize salvage will not be advanced in the United States courts against vessels of such other members of the United Nations recovered in the course of the operations covered by the memorandum .
Accept , Excellency, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration .

BRITISH EMBASSY, WASHINGTON, D. C. 25th March, 1946

SIR,

I have the honour to refer to your Note of October 10, 1945 (411.41 Ships/9-2045 ) in which notice was given that, in view of the termination of lend -lease by the Government of the United States, payments made by the United States Government on behalf of His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom in the course of operations under the Knock-for-Knock Agreement of December 4, 1942, would be made under lend-lease only in cases where the claim arose prior to the expiration of 60 days following 12.01 a. m., September 2, 1945 (V-J Day) . 2. You suggested in your Note that discussions should be held between the representatives of the Government of the United States and of His Majesty's Government concerning the continuation of the waiver features of the Knock-for-Knock Agreement of December 4, 1942, and the handling of mutual legal aid and payments under Article IV of that Agreement beyond the 60 day period mentioned above on some basis other than an accounting under the lend-lease Act.

3. I understand that the duly appointed representatives of our two Governments have now completed the discussions suggested in your Note under reference and I have the honour to state the agreement
which the United Kingdom representatives report was reached as a result of those discussions :-

(i ) It has been agreed that lend -lease and reciprocal aid funds will be available to discharge liabilities which arise from casualties occurring before midnight, October 31 , 1945 , and which are within the agreed scope of legal aid under Article IV of the Agreement and supplemental understandings. The Agreement, in both its waiver and legal aid aspects, will continue to operate thereafter and until notice is given to terminate it, but for liabilities arising from casualties occurring on or after November 1 , 1945 , which are within the scope of legal aid as determined from time to time, there will be substituted for payments under Mutual Aid the system of accounting on a cash basis which is provided for by the last sentence of Article IV.

(ii ) It is understood that for casualties occurring on or after November 1 , 1945, the United States Navy will not require legal aid under Article IV of the Agreement or supplemental understandings. (iii ) It has been further agreed that the continued operation of the Knock-for-Knock Agreement will be without prejudice to the possible adoption by the shipping authorities of our respective Governments of new policies in relation to the disposition of vessels, changes in status, and changes in insurance arrangements.

SIR : I have the honor to refer to my predecessor's note No. 738 of August
14, 1942, and to your reply No. 125 of August 15, 1942, regarding the establishment of an oil supply line which would be supplementary to that known as the Canol Project, which was dealt with by my predecessor's note of June 27th and your reply of June 29, 1942.
In that exchange of notes it was agreed that the pipeline from Skagway to Whitehorse and the storage and loading facilities at Prince Rupert should remain the property of my Government until agreement after the war upon their disposition. It was further agreed that the pipeline and the other facilities mentioned should not be dismantled until such action was recommended by the Permanent Joint Board on Defence.

Having in mind the fact that the major United States facilities at Prince Rupert are in process of being disposed of in accordance with the 33rd Recommendation of the Permanent Joint Board on
Defence, which formed the subject of the Canadian Ambassador's note to the Secretary of State of November 22 , 1944, and the Secretary of State's reply of December 20, 1944, I have now been directed to propose that the storage and loading facilities at Prince Rupert mentioned in the exchange of notes of August 14-15, 1942 , and including several buildings and structures, an open storage yard , a railroad spur, and a dock, be disposed of under the procedure established by the 33rd Recommendation without the prerequisite reference to the Board contemplated in that exchange of notes.

FOREIGN OFFICE, S. W. 1. 4th October, 1945.

YOUR EXCELLENCY, As Your Excellency is aware, informal discussions have recently
taken place in London between representatives of the Governments of the United Kingdom, United States, France, Belgium and the Netherlands regarding the urgent need for the immediate coordination of all activities undertaken with a view to restoring navigation on the Rhine. As a result of these discussions the representatives agreed to recommend to their Governments that the necessary steps should be taken to invite the Central Commission of the Rhine to resume its functions
without delay on an emergency and interim basis. It was, of course, understood that the resumption by the Commission of its pre-war functions would in no way prejudice the future determination of the permanent regime of the Rhine.
2. The above mentioned representatives also recommended that while the Commission operated on an interim basis it should include a representative of the United States Government. They proposed, for the consideration of the Governments concerned , either that the Allied military authorities controlling German riparian territory should be represented at the meetings of the Commission by liaison officers or that the Commission should include a representative of the Allied Control Commission in Germany. Lastly, they proposed that all the Governments and bodies represented on the Commission should have an equal voice in its decisions.
3. I have the honour to enquire whether Your Excellency's Government are prepared to endorse these recommendations and to propose that, in the event of all the Governments concerned signifying their agreement, His Majesty's Government should on their behalf address a communication to the Chairman of the Central Commission of the Rhine inviting him to summon a meeting of the Commission at an early date.

LONDON, October 29, 1945

SIR :

I am instructed by my Government to acknowledge your note of October 4 and to say that the United States Government will be prepared to participate in the Central Commission of the Rhine on the

following assumptions :

1. The United States will participate in the Central Commission of the Rhine on an equal basis as all other participating States, it being understood that each State will have one representative and one vote, and that the decisions of the Commission shall be taken on the basis of a majority of the members present and voting.
2. The United States will pay an equal share of the expenses of the Commission on the assumption that the expenses will be kept to a minimum necessary to enable the Commission to discharge its agreed functions.
3. The United States Government believes that it might eventually be desirable to have a representative of the Allied Control Commission in Germany on the Central Commission of the Rhine. However, in order to expedite the establishment of the Commission at the earliest possible date, the United States accepts the alternative that the Allied Military authorities controlling German riparian , territory should be represented at the meetings of the Commission by liaison officers.
4. It is understood that the Central Commission of the Rhine will
be established on a purely provisional basis without prejudice to the conclusion of negotiations by the interested Governments for the establishment of a permanent regime. It is also understood that the Commission will exercise the powers and functions accorded to the pre-war Rhine Commission by the Conventions of 1868 [ ¹ ] and 1919 [ 2] and that it will coordinate its activities with ECITO .

2. I now have the honour to inform Your Excellency that the Belgian and Netherlands Governments and the French Provisional Govern-
ment have also agreed to the above proposal and are of the opinion that in present circumstances the Allied military authorities controlling German riparian territory should be represented at the meetings of the Commission by liaison officers. 3. His Majesty's Government are accordingly requesting the French Provisional Government to invite the President of the Commission

ACCORD PROVISOIRE SUR LES LIGNES AERIENNES ENTRE LA SUISSE ET LES ETATS-UNIS D'AMERIQUE
Conclu à Berne, par échange de lettres, le 3 août 1945. Date de l'entrée en vigueur: 3 août 1945 .
Vu la recommandation concernant le modèle uniforme d'accord sur les routes aériennes provisoires qui figure dans l'acte final de la conférence internationale de l'aviation civile signé, à Chicago , le 7 décembre 1944 ,
attendu qu'il est désirable d'encourager et de favoriser réciproquement une saine évolution dans le domaine économique des transports par air entre la Suisse et les Etats-Unis d'Amérique ;
les deux Gouvernements parties au présent accord provisoire conviennent que la création et le développement des lignes aériennes entre leurs territoires nationaux respectifs seront soumis aux dispositions ci-après:
ARTICLE PREMIER.
Les parties contractantes accordent les droits spécifiés à l'annexe ci-jointe, nécessaires à l'établissement des routes et lignes aériennes civiles internationales décrites à ladite annexe, que ces lignes aient à fonctionner immédiatement ou ultérieurement au choix de la partie contractante à laquelle ces droits auront été accordés .
ARTICLE 2 .
a) Chacune des lignes aériennes ainsi décrites sera mise en exploitation aussitôt que la partie contractante qui, en vertu de l'article premier, a le droit de désigner une ou plusieurs entreprises de transports aériens pour desservir la route dont il s'agit aura donné pareille autorisation. L'autre partie contractante, qui accorde ce droit, devra , sous réserve de l'article 6 ci-après , délivrer l'autorisation d'exploitation nécessaire à l'entreprise ou aux entreprises intéressées. Toutefois , l'entreprise ou les entreprises ainsi désignées pourront être appelées à justifier de leur qualification devant les autorités aéronautiques de la partie contractante qui accorde le droit en question et conformément aux lois et règlements normalement appliqués par ces autorités avant d'être autorisées à entreprendre l'exploitation prévue par le présent accord. En outre, dans les zones de guerre ou occupées militairement, ou encore dans les régions affectées par la guerre ou l'occupation , la mise en exploitation sera subordonnée à l'approbation des autorités militaires intéressées .

60 STAT. ] SWITZERLAND- AIR TRANSPORT SERVICES-AUG. 3, 1945
b) Il est entendu que chaque partie contractante exercera aussitôt que possible, à moins d'empêchement temporaire, les droits commerciaux que lui assure le présent accord.
ARTICLE 3.
Pour éviter des différences d'application et assurer l'égalité de traitement entre elles, les parties contractantes conviennent que
a) Chaque partie contractante pourra prélever ou permettre que soient prélevés des droits justes et raisonnables pour l'usage des aéroports publics et autres installations sous son contrôle . Les parties contractantes conviennent, toutefois, que ces droits n'excéderont pas ceux que leurs aéronefs affectés à des lignes internationales analogues paieraient pour l'utilisation de ces aéroports et de ces installations .
b) Les carburants , les huiles lubrifiantes et les pièces de rechange introduits sur le territoire d'une partie contractante par l'autre partie ou ses nationaux et destinés uniquement à l'usage des aéronefs de cette autre partie contractante recevront le traitement national et celui de la nation la plus favorisée en ce qui concerne les droits de douane, frais de visite et autres droits et taxes prélevés par la partie contractante sur le territoire de laquelle est entré l'aéronef.
c) Les carburants, les huiles lubrifiantes, les pièces de rechange, l'équipement normal et les provisions de bord restant dans les aéronefs civils des entreprises de transports aériens d'une partie contractante autorisée à exploiter les lignes décrites à l'annexe seront, à leur arrivée sur le territoire de l'autre partie contractante ou à leur départ, exemptés des droits de douane, frais de visite ou autres droits et taxes de ce genre, même si ces approvisionnements sont employés ou consommés par ou sur lesdits aéronefs au cours de vols au-dessus du territoire dont il s'agit.
ARTICLE 4 .
Les certificats de navigabilité, les brevets d'aptitude et les licences délivrés ou rendus exécutoires par une partie contractante seront reconnus par l'autre partie contractante pour l'exploitation des lignes décrites à l'annexe . Chaque partie contractante se réserve, cependant, le droit de refuser de reconnaître pour les vols au-dessus de son propre territoire les brevets d'aptitude et les licences accordés à ses propres ressortissants par un autre Etat.
ARTICLE 5.
a) Les lois et règlements d'une partie contractante régissant l'entrée et la sortie du territoire de celle-ci pour les aéronefs exerçant la navigation aérienne internationale ou régissant l'exploitation et la navigation desdits aéronefs pendant qu'ils se trouvent à l'intérieur de ce territoire s'appliqueront aux aéronefs de l'autre partie et lesdits aéronefs devront s'y conformer à l'arrivée, au départ et pendant qu'ils se trouvent à l'intérieur du territoire de cette partie.

ARTICLE 6.
Chaque partie contractante se réserve le droit de refuser ou de retirer un certificat ou un permis à une entreprise de transports aériens de l'autre partie chaque fois qu'elle n'est pas convaincue qu'une part substantielle des droits de propriété ainsi que le contrôle effectif de cette entreprise sont entre les mains de ressortissants de l'une ou l'autre des parties au présent accord, ou chaque fois qu'une entreprise de transports aériens ne se conforme pas aux lois de l'Etat survolé, comme il est indiqué à l'article 5 ci-dessus, ou ne remplit pas les obligations que lui impose le présent accord .
ARTICLE 7.
Le présent accord et tous les contrats s'y rapportant seront enregistrés auprès de l'Organisation provisoire de l'aviation civile internationale .

Si ces autorités conviennent que les conditions de l'annexe doivent être complétées ou revisées , leurs recommandations à cet égard acquerront force obligatoire après avoir été confirmées par un échange de lettres diplomatiques .
