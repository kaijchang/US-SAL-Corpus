Second. That so soon as the consent of the several tribes of the Ute Nation shall have been obtained to the provisions of this agreement, the President of the United States shall cause to be distributed among them in cash the sum of sixty thousand dollars of annuities now due and provided for, and so much more as Congress may appropriate for that purpose ; and that a commission shall be sent to superintend the removal and settlement of the Utes, and to see that they are well provided with agricultural and pastoral lands sufficient for their future support, and upon such settlement being duly effected, that they are furnished with houses, wagons, agricultural implements, and stock cattle sufficient for their reasonable wants, and also such saw and grist mills as may be necessary to enable them to commence farming operations, and that the money to be appropriated by Congress for that purpose shall be apportioned among the different bands of Utes in the following manner: One-
third to those who settle on the La Plata River and vicinity, one-half to those settling on Grand River and vicinity, and one-sixth to those settling on the Uintah Reservation.
Third. That in consideration of the cession of territory to be made by the said confederated bands of the Ute Nation, the United States, in addition to the annuities and sums for provisions and clothing stipulated and provided for in existing treaties and laws, agrees to set apart and hold, as a perpetual trust for the said Ute Indians, a sum of money, or its equivalent in bonds of the United States, which shall be sufficient to produce the sum of fifty thousand dollars per annum, which sum of fifty thousand dollars shall be distributed per capita to them annually forever.
Fourth. That as soon as the President of the United States may deem it necessary or expedient, the agencies for the Uncompahgres and Southern Utes be removed to and established at suitable points, to be hereafter selected, upon the lands to be set apart, and to aid in the support of the said Utes until such time as they shall be able to support them-
selves, and that in the mean time the United States Government will establish and maintain schools in the settlements of the Utes, and make all necessary provision for the education of their children.
Fifth. All provisions of the treaty of March second, eighteen hundred and sixty-eight, and the act of Congress approved April twenty-ninth, eighteen hundred and seventy-four, not altered by this agreement, shall continue in force, and the following words from article three of said act, namely, "The United States agrees to set apart and hold, as a perpetual trust for the Ute Indians, a sum of money or its equivalent in bonds, which shall be sufficient to produce the sum of twenty-five thousand dollars per annum, which sum of twenty-five thousand dollars per annum shall be disbursed or invested at the discretion of the President, or as he may direct, for the use and benefit of the Ute Indians forever", are hereby expressly reaffirmed.

CHAP. 123.--An act to permit Elias C. Boudinot, of the Cherokee Nation, to sue in the Court of Claims.

1868, ch.186. Stat., 15,167. Preamble.

Whereas, the United States by the enactment of the one hundred and seventh section of the act of Congress approved the twentieth day of July, anno Domini eighteen hundred and sixty-eight superseded the

tenth section of the treaty entered into by and between the United States and the Cherokee Nation on the nineteenth day of July, anno Domini

eighteen hundred and sixty-six; and Whereas the property of Elias 0. Boudinot, a Cherokee Indian, was
seized and disposed of by the authorities of the United States in consequence of the enactment of said one hundred and seventh section, although the Supreme Court of the United States in its opinion expressed in the case prosecuted by said Elias C. Boudinot to test the constitutionality of said one hundred and seventh section and the validity of the said seizure and disposition of his property, and reported in eleventh Wallace

United States Supreme Court Reports, page six hundred and sixteen entitled "The Cherokee Tobacco", declared "that there was no ground for any imputation upon the integrity or good faith of" him, the said Elias C. Boudinot; and, further, that it is to be presumed that if a wrong has been done to him, the said Elias C. Boudinot, the Congress of the United States will promptly give the proper relief if applied to by the

said Elias C. Boudinot; and Whereas the Supreme Court of the United States was not called upon
to decide, and did not decide, whether the executive officers of the

United States had taken the necessary steps to make operative said one hundred and seventh section in said Cherokee Nation anterior to said

seizure of the property of said Elias C. Boudinot; and Whereas there is grave doubt that such steps were taken, and it mani-
festly appears that a wrong has been done to said Elias C. Boudinot, in

consequence of the casual infraction of the said treaty, which should be repaired by appropriate satisfaction in maintenance of said treaty, which

Elias C. Boudinot authorized to bring suit in Court of Claims.

still subsists; Now therefore, Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled, That in order to give Elias C. Boudinot, of the Cherokee Nation the proper relief for the wrong done him by reason of said seizure and disposition of his property, he, the said Elias C. Boudinot, be, and he is hereby, authorized to bring suit in the Court of Claims against the United States Government, to recover what may be due to him in justice and equity for the loss inflicted upon him by reason of said seizure for an alleged violation of the internalrevenue, laws, of his property, a tobacco factory, its detention, and dam-

age thereto whilst under seizure, the value of the tobacco, material, and other personal property also seized, and the expenses to which he was

subjected thereby.

CHAP. 123.--An act to permit Elias C. Boudinot, of the Cherokee Nation, to sue in the Court of Claims.

1868, ch.186. Stat., 15,167. Preamble.

Whereas, the United States by the enactment of the one hundred and seventh section of the act of Congress approved the twentieth day of July, anno Domini eighteen hundred and sixty-eight superseded the

tenth section of the treaty entered into by and between the United States and the Cherokee Nation on the nineteenth day of July, anno Domini

eighteen hundred and sixty-six; and Whereas the property of Elias 0. Boudinot, a Cherokee Indian, was
seized and disposed of by the authorities of the United States in consequence of the enactment of said one hundred and seventh section, although the Supreme Court of the United States in its opinion expressed in the case prosecuted by said Elias C. Boudinot to test the constitutionality of said one hundred and seventh section and the validity of the said seizure and disposition of his property, and reported in eleventh Wallace

United States Supreme Court Reports, page six hundred and sixteen entitled "The Cherokee Tobacco", declared "that there was no ground for any imputation upon the integrity or good faith of" him, the said Elias C. Boudinot; and, further, that it is to be presumed that if a wrong has been done to him, the said Elias C. Boudinot, the Congress of the United States will promptly give the proper relief if applied to by the

said Elias C. Boudinot; and Whereas the Supreme Court of the United States was not called upon
to decide, and did not decide, whether the executive officers of the

United States had taken the necessary steps to make operative said one hundred and seventh section in said Cherokee Nation anterior to said

seizure of the property of said Elias C. Boudinot; and Whereas there is grave doubt that such steps were taken, and it mani-
festly appears that a wrong has been done to said Elias C. Boudinot, in

consequence of the casual infraction of the said treaty, which should be repaired by appropriate satisfaction in maintenance of said treaty, which

Elias C. Boudinot authorized to bring suit in Court of Claims.

still subsists; Now therefore, Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled, That in order to give Elias C. Boudinot, of the Cherokee Nation the proper relief for the wrong done him by reason of said seizure and disposition of his property, he, the said Elias C. Boudinot, be, and he is hereby, authorized to bring suit in the Court of Claims against the United States Government, to recover what may be due to him in justice and equity for the loss inflicted upon him by reason of said seizure for an alleged violation of the internalrevenue, laws, of his property, a tobacco factory, its detention, and dam-

age thereto whilst under seizure, the value of the tobacco, material, and other personal property also seized, and the expenses to which he was

subjected thereby.

INSTRUCTIONS.
The receipt on the other side must be signed in the manner there described. Whoever presents the Order for payment, whether the rightful owner or otherwise, must give
full information as to the Christian name, Surname, and address of the party who originally obtained it, unless such party be a firm, when the name of the firm, together with its address, will suffice. The only exception to this rule is-- When the Order is presented through a Bank of the Town upon which it is drawn, in which
case it will suffice that the Order, being properly signed, be also crossed with the Bankers' name. These instructions are intended to secure, as far as practicable, that payment be made to the rightful party; and Postmasters have been instructed to enforce them, so far as a due regard to the public convenience will permit. As, however, aft er on ce pa yin g a Mo n ey Orde r , by wh om so ever presen ted , th e Off ice

1st.--To take all means to prevent the loss of the Money Order. 2d.--To be careful, on taking out a Money Order, to state correctly the Christian name, as
well as Surname, of the person in whose favor it is drawn. 3d.--To see that the Name and Address of the person taking out the Money Order are cor-
rectly known to the person in whose favor it is drawn. Neglect of these instructions will risk the loss of the Money, besides leading to delay and
trouble in obtaining payment.

At no recurrence of the season which the devout habit of a religious people has made the occasion for giving thanks to Almighty God and humbly invoking His continued favor, has the material prosperity enjoyed by our whole country been more conspicuous, more manifold or more universal.
During the past year, also, unbroken peace with all foreign nations, the general prevalence of domestic tranquillity, the supremacy and security of the great institutions of civil and religious freedom, have gladdened the hearts of our people, and confirmed their attachment to their government, which the wisdom and courage of our ancestors so fitly framed and the wisdom and courage of their descendants have so firmly maintained, to be the habitation of liberty and justice to successive generations.
Now, therefore, I, Rutherford B.
