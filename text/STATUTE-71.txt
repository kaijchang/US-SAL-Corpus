'"''Whereas^ The federal government exercises jurisdiction over the nation's navigable rivers and their tributaries through passage of the flood control act of nineteen hundred and thirty-six and various other acts amendatory thereto; and
''Whereas, These acts provide for construction by the United States of dams for flood control and, where feasible, in addition to flood control for storage of water to be used for irrigation, recreation, hydroelectric power, or for any of these purposes; and
^^Wherem, The Merrimack river is an interstate river and control of major floods on it can be obtained only by the construction of dams by the TTnited States under authorization of the above mentioned acts; and
"TFAerea-?, The Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the State of New Hampshire recognize that it is in the interest of their general Avelfare that the United States construct in the Merrimack river valley a comprehensive system of local protection works and dams and reservoirs to control floods and prevent loss of life and property, the disruption of orderly processes and the impairment of commerce between the aforesaid states; and
'''Whereas, The United States has constructed dikes, flood walls and other local protection works at Xashua in the State of XeAV Hampshire and at Haverhill, Lowell and Fitchburg in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and dams and reservoirs for the storage of flood waters at Franklin Falls, Peterboro and Webster in the State of New Hampshire, and has prepared designs for dikes and flood walls and other local protection works at Lawrence and North Andover in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts; and
''Whereas^ The congress has at various times authorized construction by the United States of other dams and reservoirs for the storage of flood waters in the State of New Hampshire and has more recently instructed the Corps of Engineers to determine what additional local protection works and dams and reservoirs are required for a comprehensive system to control floods in the Merrimack river and its tributaries; and
'''WhereaH, I t is believed that such a comprehensive flood control system should include dams and reservoirs controlling flood run-off from approximately thirty per cent of the total drainage area of the Merrimack river basin and strategically located in reference to characteristics of tributaries and to damage centers; and
''Whereas, Dams and reservoirs to control thirty per cent of flood run-off will be located in the State of New Hampshire and the major benefits from such dams and reservoirs will accrue to the CommonAvealth of Massachusetts; and
''Whereas^ Construction by the United States of additional dams and reservoirs in the State of NeAv Hampshire, to complete such a comprehensive flood control system, will remove from the tax rolls of local governments of the State of New Hampshire such property as is acquired by the United States and may work other hardships against the people of New Hampshire; and
^^ Whereas, I t is highly desirable that any flood control dam and reservoir constructed by the United States in the Merrimack river valley have the approval of the State of New Hampshire and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts benefiting from construction of such dam and reservoir make reimbursement for such loss of taxes and for such hardships; and
''Whereas, A comprehensive system for the prevention of destructive floods and for water resources utilization in the Merrimack river valley can best be accomplished by cooperation between the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the State of New Hampshire and bv

"Annually, not later than November first of each year the commission shall determine the loss of taxes resulting to political subdivisions of the State of New Hampshire by reason of acquisition and ownership therein by the United States of lands, rights or other property in connection with each flood control dam and reservoir for which provision for tax reimbursement has been made in the preceding paragraph. Such losses of taxes as determined by the commission shall be based on the tax rate then current in each such political subdivision and on the average assessed valuation for a period of five years prior

to the acquisition by the United States of sucli property; provided, that whenever a political subdivision wherein a flood control dam and reservoir or portion thereof is located shall have made a general revaluation of property subject to the annual municipal taxes of such subdivision, the commission may use such revaluation for the purpose of determining the amount of taxes for which reimbursement shall be made in the paragraph next above. Using the percentage of payment agreed to m said paragraph, the commission shall then compute the sum, if any, due from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to the State of New Hampshire and shall send notice to the treasurer of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts setting forth in detail the sums, if any, to be paid to the State of New Hampshire in reimbursement of tax losses.
"The Commonwealth of Massachusetts on receipt of formal notification from the commission of the sum which it is to pay in reimbursement for tax losses shall, not later than July first of the following year, make its payment for such tax losses to the State of New Hampshire, except that in case of the first annual payment for tax losses at any dam or reservoir such payment shall be made by the CommonAvealth of Massachusetts not later than July first of the year in which the next regular session of its legislature is held.
"Payment by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts of its share of reimbursement for taxes in accordance with formal notification received from the commission shall be a complete and final discharge of all liability of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to the State of New Hampshire for each flood control dam and reservoir within the State of New Hampshire for the time specified in such formal notification. The State of New Hampshire shall have full responsibility for distributing or expending all such sums received and no agency or political subdivision shall have any claim against the (^onmionwealth of Massachusetts nor against the commission relative to tax losses covered by such payments.
"Whenever the Cotnmonwealth of Massachusetts and the State of New Hampshire shall agree, through the commission, on a lump sum payment in lieu of annual payments and such lump sum payment has been made and received, the requirement that the commission annually shall determine the tax losses, compute sums due from tlie Commonwealth of Massachusetts and send notice thereof to the treasurer of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, shall no longer apply to the aforesaid states with respect to any flooil control dam and reservoir for which lump sum payment has been made and received.
"The Commonwealth of Massachusetts agrees to pay the State of New Hampshire its respective share in reimbursement, as determined by the commission under the procedure following, for economic losses and damages occurring by reason of ownership of property by the United States for construction and operation of a flood control dam and reservoir at any site specified in Article IV, and for any other flood control dam and reservoir constructed hereafter by the United States in the Merrimack river valley; provided, however, that no reimbursement shall be made for speculative losses and damages or losses or damages for which the United States is liable.
"On receipt of information from the chief of engineers that request is to be made for funds for the purpose of preparing detailed plans and specifications for any flood control dam and reservoir proposed to be constructed in the Merrimack river valley, including those specified in Article IV, the commission shall make an estimate of the amount of taxes which would be lost to and of economic losses and damages which would occur in political subdivisions of the State

payment formula which, being based on full repayment within said

period under normal conditions, permits variance in the required

annual payments in the light of economic factors pertinent to the

ability of the irrigators to pay: Provided^ That for a period of ten

interest of national security.

(e) Contracts relating to municipal, domestic, and industrial water

organization. The care, operation, and maintenance of project works

which serve two or more contracting organizations may or shall, as

the case may be, be transferred in like circumstances to an organiza-

tion satisfactory to all of said organizations and to the Secretary.

Any transfer made pursuant to the authority of this section shall be

upon terms and conditions satisfactory to the Secretary, and the works

transferred shall be operated and maintained without further expense

to the United States. If the transferred works serve a flood control

or fish and wildlife function, they shall be operated and maintained in

accordance with regulations with respect thereto prescribed by the

Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of the Interior, respectively,

and upon failure so to operate or maintain them they shall, upon

demand, be returned immediately to the Secretary of the Interior.

SEC. 3. The Secretary is authorized to construct minimum basic rec-

to the preservation and propagation of fish and wildlife shall, except

as is otherwise provided in this Act, be nonreimbursable and nonreturn-

able under the reclamation laws. The Secretary shall, upon conclusion

of a suitable agreement with a qualified agency and subject to such

conditions as may be set forth in the repayment contracts, permit said

agency to construct, operate, and maintain additional public recre-

Be it enacted hy the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled^ That (a) the Federal Power Commission is hereby expressly authorized and directed to issue a license to the Power Authority of the State of New York for the construction and operation of a power project with capacity to utilize all of the United States share of the water of the Niagara Kiver permitted to be used by international agreement.
(b) The Federal Power Commission shall include among the licensing conditions, in addition to those deemed necessary and required under the terms of the Federal Power Act, the following:
(1) In order to assure that at least 50 per centum of the project
Eower shall be available for sale and distribution primarily for the enefit of the people as consumers, particularly domestic and rural consumers, to whom such power shall be made available at the lowest rates reasonably possible and in such maimer as to encourage the widest possible use, the licensee in disposing of 50 per centum of the project power shall give preference and priority to public bodies and nonprofit cooperatives within economic transmission distance. In any case in which project power subject to the preference provisions of this paragraph is sold to utility companies organized and administered for profit, the licensee shall make flexible arrangements and contracts providing for the withdrawal upon reasonable notice and fair terms of enough power to meet the reasonably foreseeable needs of the preference customers.
(2) The licensee shall make a reasonable portion of the project power subject to the preference provisions of paragraph (1) available for use within reasonable economic transmission distance in neighboring States, but this paragraph shall not be construed to require more than 20 per centum of the project power subject to such preference provisions to be made available for use in such States. The licensee shall cooperate with the appropriate agencies in such States to insure compliance w^ith this requirement. In the event of disagreement between the licensee and the power-marketing agencies of any of such States, the Federal Power Commission may, after public hearings, determine and fix the applicable portion of power to be made available and the terms applicable thereto: Provided^ That if any such State shall have designated a bargaining agency for the procurement of such power on behalf of such State, the licensee shall deal only with such agency in that State. The arrangements made by the licensee for the sale of power to or in such States shall include observance of the preferences in paragraph (1) of this subsection.
(3) The licensee shall contract, with the approval of the Governor of the State of New York, pursuant to the procedure established by
New York law, to sell to the licensee of Federal Power Commission project 16 for a pefiod ending not later than the final maturity date of the bonds initially issued to finance the project works herein specifically authorized, four hundred and forty-five thousand kilowatts of the remaining project power, which is equivalent to the amount produced by project 16 prior to June 7, 1956, for resale generally to the industries which purchased power produced by project 16 prior to such date, or their successors, in order as nearly as possible to restore lowpower costs to such industries and for the same general purposes for which power from project 16 was utilized: Provided, That the licensee

(4) The licensee shall, if available on reasonable terms and conditions, acquire by purchase or other agreement, the ownership or use of, or if unable to do so, construct such transmission lines as may be necessary to make the power and energy generated at the project available in wholesale quantities for sale on fair and reasonable terms and conditions to privately owned companies, to the preference customers enumerated in paragraph (1) of this subsection, and to the neighboring States in accordance with paragraph (2) of this subsection.
(5) In the event project power is sold to any purchaser for resale, contracts for such sale shall include adequate provisions for establishing resale rates, to be approved by the licensee, consistent with paragraphs (1) and (3) of this subsection.
(6) The licensee, in cooperation with the appropriate agency of the State of New York which is concerned with the development of parks in such State, may construct a scenic drive and park on the American side of the Niagara River, near the Niagara Falls, pursuant to a plan the general outlines of which shall be approved by the Federal Power Commission; and the cost of such drive and park shall be considered a part of the cost of the power project and part of the licensee's net investment in said project: Provided^ That the maximum part of the cost of such drive and park to be borne by the power project and to be considered a part of the licensee's net investment shall not exceed $15,000,000. _
(7) The licensee shall pay to the United States and include in its net investment in the project herein authorized the United States share of the cost of the construction of the remedial works, including engineering and economic investigations, undertaken in accordance with article I I of the treaty between the United States of America and Canada concerning uses of the waters of the Niagara Eiver signed February 27, 1950, whenever such remedial works are constructed.
SEC. 2. The license issued under the terms of this Act shall be granted in conformance with Rules of Practice and Procedure of the Federal Power Commission, but in the event of any conflict, the provisions of this Act shall govern in respect of the project herein authorized.

Act.

LEGISLATIVE FINDIN(4
SEC. 2. Wholesome poultry products are an important source of the Nation's total supply of food. Such products are consumed throughout the Nation and substantial quantities thereof move in interstate and foreign commerce. Unwholesome and adulterated poultry products in the channels of interstate or foreign commerce, are injurious to the public welfare, adversely affect the marketing of w^holesome poultry products, result in sundry losses to producers, and destroy markets for wholesome poultry products. The marketing of wholesome poultry products is affected with the public interest and directly affects the welfare of the people. All poultry and poultry products which have or are required to have inspection under this Act are either in the current of interstate or foreign commerce or directly affect such commerce. That part that enters directly into the current of interstate or foreign commerce cannot be effectively inspected and regulated without also inspecting and regulating all poultry and poultry products processed or handled in the same establishment.
The great volume of poultry products required as an article of food for the inhabitants of large centers of population may directly affect the movement of poultry and poultry products in interstate commerce. To protect interstate commerce in poultry and poultry products inspected for wholesomeness, from being adversely burdened, obstructed, or affected by uninspected poultry or poultry products, major consuming areas where poultry or poultry products are handled or consumed in suclx volume as to affect the movement of inspected poultry or poultry products in interstate commerce should be designated by the Secretary pursuant to the provisions of this Act.
DECLARATION OF POLICY
SEC. 3. I t is hereby declared to be the policy of Congress to pi-ovide for the inspection of poultry and poultry products by the inspection service as herein provided to prevent the movement in interstate or foreign commerce or in a designated major consuming area of poultry products which are unwholesome, adulterated, or otherwise unfit for human food.

"C. 1. All rights, acquired by appropriation after the effective date of this compact, to use waters originating within the Upper Klamath River Basin for use (a) or (b) in the Upper Klamath River Basin in either state shall be superior to any rights, acquired after the effective date of this compact, to use such waters (i) for any purpose outside the Klamath River Basin by diversion in California or (ii) for use (c), (d), (e) or (f) anywhere in the Klamath River Basin. Such superior rights shall exist regardless of their priority in time and may be exercised with respect to inferior rights without the payment of compensation. But such superior rights to use water for use (b) in California shall be limited to the quantity of water neces-

"2. The provisions of paragraph 1 of this subdivision C shall not prohibit the acquisition and exercise after the effective date of this compact of rights to store waters originating within the Upper Klamath River Basin and to make later use of such stored water for any purpose, as long as the storing of waters for such later use, while being effected, does not interfere with the direct diversion or storage of such waters for use (a) or (b) in the Upper Klamath River Basin.

"ARTICLE IV. HYDROELECTRIC POWER
" I t shall be the objective of each state, in the formulation and execution and the granting of authority for the formulation and execution of plans for the distribution and use of the waters of the Klamath River Basin, to provide for the most efficient use of available power head and its economic integration with the distribution of water for other beneficial uses in order to secure the most economical distribution and use of water and lowest power rates which may be reasonable for irrigation and drainage pumping, including pumping from wells.

"ARTICLE V. INTERSTATE DIVERSION AND STORAGE
RIGHTS; MEASURING DEVICES
A. Each state hereby grants for the benefit of the other and its designees the right to construct and operate facilities for the measurement, diversion, storage and conveyance of water from the Upper Klamath River Basin in one state for use in the other insofar as the exercise of such right may be necessary to effectuate and comply with the terms of this compact. The location of such facilities shall be subject to approval by the commission.
"(B) Each state or its designee, exercising within the jurisdiction of the other a right granted under subdivision A of this article, shall make provision for the establishment, operation and maintenance of permanent gaging stations at such points on streams or reservoir or conveyance facilities as may be required by the commission for the purpose of ascertaining and recording the volume of diversions by the streams or facilities involved. Said stations shall be equipped with suitable devices for determining the flow of water at all times. All information obtained from such stations shall be compiled in accordance with the standards of the United States Geological Survey, shall be filed with the commission, and shall be available to the public.

"ARTICLE VI. ACQUISITION or PROPERTY FOR STORAGE AND DIVERSION ;

A state making the latter election shall make a written request therefor and the other state shall expeditiously acquire said property rights either by purchase at a price satisfactory to the requesting state, or, if such purchase cannot be made, then through the exercise of its power of eminent domain, and shall convey said property rights to the requesting state or its designee. All costs

71 S T A T . ]

PUBLIC LAW 8 5 - 2 2 2 - A U G . 30, 1957

501

of such acquisition shall be paid by the requesting state. Neither state shall have any greater power to acquire property rights for the other state through the exercise of the power of eminent domain than it would have under its laws to acquire the same property rights for itself.
"B. Should any diversion, storage or conveyance facilities be constructed or acquired in either state for the benefit of the other state, as herein provided, the construction, repair, replacement, maintenance and operation of such facilities shall be subject to the laws of the state in which the facilities are located, except that the proper officials of that state shall permit the storage, release and conveyance of any water to which the other state is entitled under this compact.
"C. Either state having property rights other than water rights in the other state acquired as provided in this article shall pay to each political subdivision of the state in which such property rights are located, each and every year during which such rights are held, a sum of money equivalent to the average annual amount of taxes assessed against those rights during the 10 years preceding the acquisition of such rights in reimbursement for the loss of taxes to such political subdivisions of the state. Payments so made to a political subdivision shall be in lieu of any and all taxes by that subdivision on the property rights for which the payments are made.

"ARTICLE VII. POLLUTION CONTROL
"A. The states recognize that the growth of population and the economy of the Upper Klamath River Basin can result in pollution of the waters of the Upper Klamath River Basin constituting a menace to the health and welfare of, and occasioning economic loss to, people living or having interests in the Klamath River Basin. The states recognize further that protection of the beneficial uses of the waters of the Klamath River Basin requires cooperative action of the two states in pollution abatement and control.
"B. To aid in such pollution abatement and control, the commission shall have the duty and power:
"1. To cooperate with the states or agencies thereof or other entities and with the United States for the purpose of promoting effective laws and the adoption of effective regulations for abatement and control of pollution of the waters of the Klamath River Basin, and from time to time to recommend to the governments reasonable minimum standards for the quality of such waters.
"2. To disseminate to the public by any and all appropriate means information respecting pollution abatement and control in the waters of the Klamath River Basin and on the harmful and uneconomic results of such pollution.
"C. Each state shall have the primary obligation to take appropriate action under its own laws to abate and control interstate pollution, which is defined as the deterioration of the quality of the waters of the Upper Klamath River Basin within the boundaries of such state which materially and adversely affects beneficial uses of waters of the Klamath River Basin in the other state. Upon complaint to the commission by the state water pollution control agency of one state that interstate pollution originating in the other state is not being prevented or abated, the procedure shall be as follows:
"1. The commission shall make an investigation and hold a conference on the alleged interstate pollution with the water pollution control agencies of the two states, after which the commission shall recommend appropriate corrective action.

602

[71 STAT.

"2. If appropriate corrective action is not taken within a reasonable time, the commission shall call a hearing, giving reasonable notice in writing thereof to the water pollution control agencies of the two states and to the person or persons which it is believed are causing the alleged interstate pollution. Such hearing shall be held in accordance with rules and regulations of the commission, which shall conform as nearly as practicable with the laws of the two states governing administrative hearings. A t the conclusion of such hearing, the commission shall make a finding as to whether interstate pollution exists, and if so, shall issue to any person or persons which the commission finds are causing such interstate pollution an order or orders for correction thereof.
"3. I t shall be the duty of the person against whom any such order is issued to comply therewith. An^ court of general jurisdiction of the state where such discharge is occurring or the United States District Court for the district where the discharge is occurring shall have jurisdiction, on petition of the commission for enforcement of such order, to compel action by mandamus, injunction, specific performance, or any other appropriate remedy, or on petition of the person against whom the order is issued to review any order. A t the conclusion of such enforcement or review proceedings, the court may enter such decree or judgment affirming, reversing, modifying, or remanding such order as in its judgment is proper in the circumstances on the basis of the rules customarily applicable in proceedings for court enforcement or review of administrative actions.
"D. The water pollution control agencies of the two states shall, from time to time, make available to the commission all data relating to the quality of the waters of the Upper Klamath River Basin which they possess as the result of studies, surveys and investigations thereof which they may have made.
"ARTICLE V I I I . MISCELLANEOUS
"A. Subject to vested rights as of the effective date of this compact, there shall be no diversion of waters from the basin of Jenny Creek to the extent that such waters are required, as determined by the commission, for use on land within the basin of Jenny Creek.
"B. Each state shall exercise whatever administrative, judicial, legislative or police powers it has that are required to provide any necessary re-regulation or other control over the flow of the Klamath River downstream from any hydroelectric power plant for protection of fish, human life or property from damage caused by fluctuations resulting from the operation of such plant.

JOINT RESOLUTION Providing for the recognition and endorsement of the second World Metal-

August 31. 1957 [H. J. Res. 404]

Whereas the growing demand upon the metal resources of the world presents a problem prompting the most serious consideration among nations; and
Whereas a broader acquaintanceship with present day mineral resources and the means for conserving these diminishing resources is essential to the well-being of mankind; and
Whereas our own mineral resources being deficient in several vital minerals, the United States is faced with continued dependence upon overseas and other sources; and
Whereas the outlook for improvement in basic resources is not encouraging, there is need for broad scientific research and widescale exploration to effect discovery of new metals and metal resources; and
Whereas the free exchange of scien4:ific information among the world's metallurgists will contribute to the betterment of this deficiency at home and abroad; and
Whereas the United States has a responsibility and an opportunity to provide vigorous leadership in the search for substitutes for critical resources in order to preserve these resources from complete exhaustion; and
Whereas the metal scientist is today accepting this challenge in good spirit and with efficient performance, contributing actively to the mastery of new wonder metals and the peacetime uses of the atom; and
Whereas the economic health of the world will be enhanced if the United States nurtures a friendly attitude toward worldwide scientific and industrial efforts; and
Whereas several hundred distinguished metal scientists from twoscore countries throughout the world will visit our shores in October and November of 1957 to participate in deliberations on metal resources and operations: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved hy the Senate and House of Refresentatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled^ That the Congress hereby extends its official welcome to the overseas metal scientists w^ho will attend the World Metallurgical Congress, November 2 to 8, 1957, under the sponsorship of the American Society for Metals. The President is authorized and requested, by proclamation, or in such manner as he may deem proper, to grant recognition to the World Metallurgical Congress and the American Society for Metals for its instigation and sponsorship of this second world gathering of metal scientists, calling upon officials and agencies of the Government to assist and cooperate with such congress as occasion may warrant.

"i. I n order to protect the public and to encourage the develop-
ment of the atomic energy industry, in the interest of the general welfare and of the common defense and security, the United States may make funds available for a portion of the damages suffered by the public from nuclear incidents, and may limit the liability of those persons liable for such losses." ^^^- ^- Subsection 53 e.

' u. The term 'public liability' means any legal liability arising out of or resulting from a nuclear incident, except claims under State or Federal Workmen's Compensation Acts of employees of persons indemnified who are employed at the site of and in connection with the activity where the nuclear incident occurs, and except for claims arising out of an act of war, 'Public liability' also includes damage to property of persons indemnified: Provided, That such property is covered under the terms of the financial protection required, except property which is located at the site of and used in connection with the activity where the nuclear incident occurs." SEC. 4. The Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, is amended by adding thereto a new section, with the appropriate amendment to
the table of contents:
"SEC. 170. INDEMNIFICATION AND LIMITATION or LIABILITY.--
"^- Eacli liceuse issued under section 103 or 104 and each construction permit issued under section 185 shall, and each license issued under section 53, 63, or 81 may, have as a condition of the license a requirement that the licensee have and maintain financial protection of such type and in such amounts as the Commission

71 S T A T . ]

PUBLIC LAW 8 5 - 2 5 6 - S E P T . 2, 1957

577

shall require in accordance with subsection 170 b. to cover public liability claims. Whenever such financial protection is required, it shall be a further condition of the license that the licensee execute and maintain an indemnification agreement in accordance with subsection 170 c. The Commission may require, as a further condition of issuing a license, that an applicant waive any immunity from public liability conferred by Federal or State law.
"b. The amount of financial protection required shall be the amount of liability insurance available from private sources, except that the Commission may establish a lesser amount on the basis of criteria set forth in writing, w^hich it may revise from time to time, taking into consideration such factors as the following: (1) the cost and terms of private insurance, (2) the type, size, and location of the licensed activity and other factors pertaining to the hazard, and (3) the nature and purpose of the licensed activity: Provided^ That for facilities designed for producing substantial amounts of electricity and having a rated capacity of 100,000 electrical kilowatts or more, the amount of financial protection required shall be the maximum amount available from private sources. Such financial protection may include private insurance, private contractual indemnities, self insurance, other proof of financial responsibility, or a combination of such measures.
"c. The Commission shall, with respect to licenses issued between August 30, 1954, and August 1,1967, for which it requires financial protection, agree to indemnify and hold harmless the licensee and other persons indemnified, as their interest may appear, from public liability arising from nuclear incidents which is in excess of the level of financial protection required of the licensee. The aggregate indemnity for all persons indemnified in connection with each nuclear incident shall not exceed $500,000,000 including the reasonable costs of investigating and settling claims and defending suits for damage. Such a contract of indemnification shall cover public liability arising out of or in connection with the licensed activity.
"d. In addition to any other authority the Commission may have, the Commission is authorized until August 1, 1967, to enter into agreements of indemnification with its contractors for the construction or operation of production or utilization facilities or other activities under contracts for the benefit of the United States involving activities under the risk of public liability for a substantial nuclear incident. I n such agreements of indemnification the Commission may require its contractor to provide and maintain financial protection of such a type and in such amounts as the Commission shall determine to be appropriate to cover public liability arising out of or in connection with the contractual activity, and shall indemnify the persons indemnified against such claims above the amount of the financial protection required, in the amount of $500,000,000 including the reasonable costs of investigating and settling claims and defending suits for damage in the aggregate for allpersons indemnified in connection with such contract and for each nuclear incident.

The Commission or any person indemnified may apply to the appropriate district court of the United States having venue in bankruptcy matters over the location of the nuclear incident, and upon a showing that the public liability from a single nuclear incident will probably exceed the limit of liability imposed by this section, shall be entitled to such orders as may be appropriate for enforcement of the provisions of this section, including an order limiting the liability of the persons indemnified, orders staying the payment of claims and the execution of court judgments, orders apportioning the payments to be made to claimants, orders permitting partial payments to be made before final determination of the total claims, and an order setting aside a part of the funds available for possible latent injuries not discovered until a later time.
"f. The Commission is authorized to collect a fee from all persons with w^hom an indemnification agreement is executed under this section. This fee shall be $30 per year per thousand kilowatts of thermal energy capacity for facilities licensed under section 103. For facilities licensed under section 104, and for construction permits under section 185, the Commission is authorized to reduce the fee set forth above. The Commission shall establish criteria in writing for determination of the fee for facilities licensed under section 104, taking into consideration such factors as (1) the type, size, and location of facility involved, and other factors pertaining to the hazard, and (2) the nature and purpose of the facility. For other licenses, the Commission shall collect such nominal fees as it deems appropriate. No fee under this subsection shall be less than $100 per year.
"g. I n administering the provisions of this section, the Commission shall use, to the maximum extent practicable, the facilities and services of private insurance organizations, and the Commission may contract to pay a reasonable compensation for such services. Any contract made under the provisions of this subsection may be made without regard to the provisions of section 3709 of the Revised Statutes, as amended, upon a showing by the Commission that advertising is not reasonably practicable and advance payments may be made.
"h. The agreement of indemnification may contain such terms as the Commission deems appropriate to carry out the purposes of this section. Such agreement shall provide that, when the Commission makes a determination that the United States will probably be required to make indemnity payments under this section, the Commission shall collaborate with any person indemnified and may approve the payment of any claim under the agreement of indemnification, appear through the Attorney General on behalf of the person indemnified, take charge of such action, and settle or defend any such action. The Commission shall have final authority on behalf of the United States to settle or approve the settlement of any such claim on a fair and reasonable basis with due regard for the purposes of this Act. Such settlement may include reasonable expenses in connection with the claim incurred by the person indemnified.
"i. After any nuclear incident which will probably require payments by the United States under this section, the Commission shall make a survey of the causes and extent of damage which shall forthwith be reported to the Joint Committee, and, except as forbidden by the provisions of chapter 12 of this Act or any other law or Executive order, all final findings shall be

"(a) In any criminal prosecution brought by the United States, no statement or report in the possession of the United States which was made by a Government witness or prospective Government witness (other than the defendant) to an agent of the Government shall be the subject of subpena, discovery, or inspection until said witness has testified on direct examination in the trial of the case.
" ( b ) After a witness called by the United States has testified on direct examination, the court shall, on motion of the defendant, ordei" the United States to produce any statement (as hereinafter defined) of the witness in the possession of the United States which relates to the subject matter as to which the witness has testified. If the entire contents of any such statement relate to the subject matter of the testimony of the witness, the court shall order it to be delivered directly to the defendant for his examination and use.
"(c) If the United States claims that any statement ordered to be produced under this section contains matter which does not relate to the subject matter of the testimony of the witness, the court shall order the United States to deliver such statement for the inspection of the court in camera. Upon such delivery the court shall excise the portions of such statement which do not relate to the subject matter of the testimony of the witness. With such material excised, the court shall then direct delivery of such statement to the defendant for his use. If, pursuant to such procedure, any portion of such statement is withheld from the defendant and the defendant objects to such withholding, and the trial is continued to an adjudication of the guilt of the defendant, the entire text of such statement shall be preserved by the United States and, in the event the defendant appeals, shall be made available to the appellate court for the purpose of determining the correctness of the ruling of the trial judge. Whenever any statement is delivered to a defendant pursuant to this section, the court in its discretion, upon application of said defendant, may recess proceedings in the trial for such time as it may determine to be reasonably required for the examination of such statement by said defendant and his preparation for its use in the trial.
" ( d ) If the United States elects not to comply with an order of the court under paragraph (b) or (c) hereof to deliver to the defendant any such statement, or such portion thereof as the court may direct, the court shall strike from the record the testimony of the witness, and the trial shall proceed unless the court in its discretion shall determine that the interests of justice require that a mistrial be declared.

Whereas the barbaric action of the Soviet Union in Hungary demonstrates that the Soviet Union is determined to go to any and all lengths to maintain its empire of enslaved peoples by the most brutal forms of armed subjugation and repression; and
Whereas the Special Committee on the Problem of Hungary, created by the General Assembly of the United Nations under its resolution 1132 ( X I ) adopted at its six hundred and thirty-sixth plenary meeting on January 10, 1957, has established that what took place in Hungary in the latter part of 1956 was a spontaneous national uprising caused by long-standing gi-ievances engendered by the oppressive way of life under Communist rule and by the state of captivity of Hungary under control of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; and
Whereas the crisis and foment created by developments in the satellite nations require a continued reevaluation by the United States and the United Nations of strategic policy to meet changing conditions : Now, therefore, be it
Resolved by the House of Representatives {the Senate concurring), That it is the sense of the Congress that the President, through the United States representatives to the United Nations at the forthcoming special reconvening of the General Assembly of the United Nations, should take every appropriate action toward the immediate consideration and adoption of the report of the United Nations Special Committee on the Problem of Hungary and toward the immediate consideration of other available information on the brutal action of the

Soviet Union in Hungary. I t is further the sense of the Congress that the President, through such United States representatives, should at such reconvened session join actively in seeking the most effective way of dealing with the report of the United Nations Special Committee in order to advance the objectives of the United Nations regarding the situation in Hungary, to prevent further repressive action by the Soviet Union, and to seek all practical redress of the wrong which has been committed in violation of the principles of the United Nations and the elemental requirements of humanity.
SEC. 2. I t is the sense of the C o n f e s s that the United States should implement policies, through the United Nations or in cooperation with the peoples of the free world, that will work toward the freedom and independence of the captive nations, and will effectively utilize the position of the United States through all proper means, to the end that the Hungarian tragedy shall not be repeated anywhere.

Whereas the President of the United States has approved the national program for the publication of historical documents, as set forth in the Commission's published report to him (and summarized in the Appendix of the Congressional Record for July 22, 1955) ; and
Whereas it is important that the people of the United States understand the history of their country and of its relationship to the rest of the world; and
Whereas the publication of such source materials as letters, diaries, journals, sermons, speeches, reports, and other documents--the firsthand evidence of the initiative, courage, and spiritual qualities of the men and women who have helped to shape our country's destiny--would contribute to a better understanding of the history of the United States in all of its manifold aspects, and would thereby strengthen the defense of our country against its enemies: Therefore be it

WHEREAS the said Proclamation No. 3095 amended the said Proclamation No. 3019 so as to establish thereafter as the quota year for peanuts the 12-month period beginning August 1 in any year;
W H E R E A S the total quantity of such peanuts which m a y be entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption under the said Proclamation No. 3019, as amended, during the 12-month period beginning August 1, 1956 has already been entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption;
W H E R E A S , pursuant to section 22 (d) of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended, the United States Tariff Commission has made a supplemental investigation to determine whether there is a deficit in t h e domestic supply of Virginia-type peanuts, shelled (not including peanuts blanched, salted, prepared, or preserved), of sizes averaging in representative samples not more than 40 kernels per ounce, such as to require an increase in the quantity of such peanuts which m a y be permitted to be entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption during the early part of the quota year beginning August 1, 1956, to meet essential requirements of domestic users of such peanuts, and, if so, what additional quantity or quantities of such peanuts may be permitted to be so entered or withdrawn without materially interfering with or rendering ineffective the program of the Department of Agriculture with respect to peanuts;
W H E R E A S the United States Tariff Commission has submitted to me a report of its findings and recommendation in connection with the said supplemental investigation; and
W H E R E A S , on the basis of said supplemental investigation and report of the Tariff Commission, I find that the domestic supply of

ALEXANDER HAMILTON BICENTENNIAL BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

A PROCLAMATION

Alexander Hamilton Bicentennial.

One hundred and sixty-nine years ago today, on Monday, September 17, 1787, the Constitution of the United States was signed by the Founding Fathers, and a crucial nine-month campaign for its adoption was begun. As we celebrate that momentous event, it is fitting that we take notice of Alexander Hamilton, who, at the age of thirty, was recognized as one of the principal architects and leaders of the movement for "a more perfect Union" of the States.
Five years earlier Hamilton's imagination had shown him the noble and magnificent prospect of a great Federal Republic, closely linked in the pursuit of a common interest, tranquil and prosperous at home, and respected abroad. His vision, together with that of other patriots, brought forth the United States of America under the Constitution.
Alexander Hamilton served his country well throughout his life-- during the Revolutionary War as aide-de-camp and military secretary to General Washington, as commander of the American columns in the final assault on Yorktown, and, later, as Major General and Senior Officer of the Army; in the Continental Congress, in the Assembly of the State of New York, in the Annapolis Convention of 1786, which led to the momentous meeting in Philadelphia the following year, and in that meeting in 1787 during which the Constitution was framed. During the succeeding months he was untiring in his efforts to secure acceptance of the Constitution by the States, and his subsequent service as first Secretary of the Treasury under the new Government proved him to be one of the boldest and most far-sighted of the founders of our Nation.
The opportunity has now come to our generation to demonstrate our gratitude and our obligation to Alexander Hamilton by a fitting celebration of the two hundredth anniversary of his birth--a happy opportunity for all of us to think afresh of his sincere efforts and inspiring leadership in the work of the men who laid the foundations, raised the structure, and built the sustaining traditions of the Government of the United States.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER, President of the United States of America, in accord with the purposes of the Congress, do hereby urge the Governors of the several States, and do call upon all officials and agencies of Federal Government, and upon all citizens, to observe the year commencing January 11, 1957, as the Alexander Hamilton Bicentennial, and to do honor to his memory

71 STAT.]

during that period with appropriate activities and ceremonies commemorative of his inspiring role in our national life.
And I hereby direct that on January 11, 1957, the anniversary of Alexander Hamilton's birth, the flag of the United States be appropriately displayed on all Government buildings in the United States and all offices of this Government abroad.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.

NOW, THEREFORE, I, DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER, President of the United States of America, do hereby invite the people of this Nation to observe Thursday, the eleventh day of October, 1956, as General Pulaski's Memorial Day with suitable commemorative ceremonies; and I direct that the flag of the United States be displayed on all Government buildings on that day as a mark of respect to the memory of General Pulaski.

THANKSGIVING D A Y , 1956 BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

November 12,1956 [No. 3163]

A PROCLAMATION

With the completion of the cycle of winter and summer, seedtime and harvest, we come to the traditional time of thanksgiving, when our minds and hearts turn to Almighty God in grateful acknowledgment of His mercies throughout the year.

Let us be grateful that the foundations of freedom in our Nation grow stronger with each passing year, giving hope to fettered peoples that they m a y walk as free men unafraid; that the yield of our soil and the production of our factories have been abundant, enriching our lives and enabling us to share our bounty with less fortunate ones in other lands; and that the forces of nature are being harnessed for peaceful purposes, bringing limitless possibilities of comfort and happiness both to ourselves and to future generations.

It is also fitting at this season that we should consider God's providence to us throughout our entire history. Let us remember the Pilgrim Fathers who, fleeing from religious oppression, landed on a bleak, forbidding shore and began to carve out what became this great Republic which it is our happy destiny to love and serve. For their foresight, their courage, and their idealism let us give thanks to the Power which has made and preserved us a Nation.

Humbly aware that we are a people gJ?eatly blessed, both materially

and spiritually, let us pray this year not only in the spirit of thanks-

giving but also as suppliants for God's guidance, to the end that we

may follow the course of righteousness and be worthy of His favor.

THEREFORE,

and the oppressed in foreign lands.

Particularly, on this United Nations Human Rights Day, let us take to heart the lessons the Hungarian people have written in their blood and in their sacrifice and in their indomitable will to be free: That those who have once known freedom and the free exercise of human rights value them above life itself; That decent men and women everywhere are stirred to a deep and enduring sympathy for the heroic oppressed, a sympathy that surmounts all barriers of geography and race.
Let us resolve to give generously of our substance that the hardships and suffering of the Hungarian people may be relieved and let us pray that this season of tragedy for them may end in the return of rights and freedom and self-government.

IMPOSING A QUOTA ON BUTTER SUBSTITUTES, INCLUDING BUTTER O I L BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

April 15,19S7 [No. 3178]

A PROCLAMATION

W H E R E A S , pursuant to section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended (7 U. S. C. 624), the Secretary of Agriculture advised 62stat. i24s. me that there was reason to believe that butter substitutes, including butter oil, containing 45 per centum or more of butterfat, which are dutiable under paragraph 709 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, Ig^usc^fcioi par are practically certain to be imported i.nto the United States under such 709. conditions and in such quantities as to render or tend to render ineffective, or materially interfere with, the price-support program undertaken by the Department of Agriculture with respect to milk and butterfat, or to reduce substantially the amount of products processed in the United States from domestic milk and butterfat with respect to which such program of the Department of Agriculture is being undertaken; and
W H E R E A S on November 17, 1956, under the authority of the said section 22, I caused the United States Tariff Commission to make an 7 u s e 624. investigation with respect to this matter; and
WHEREAS, in accordance with the said section 22, as implemented by Executive Order No. 7233 of November 23, 1935, the said Tariff Commission has made such investigation and has reported to me its findings and recommendations made in connection therewith; and
W H E R E A S , on the basis of the said investigation and report of the Tariff Commission, I find that butter substitutes, including butter oil, containing 45 per centum or more of butterfat and classifiable under paragraph 709 of the Tariff Act of 1930 are practically certain to be ^^^ ^sc looi, par. imported into the United States under such conditions and in such quantities as to materially interfere with the said price-support program with respect to milk and butterfat, and to reduce substantially the amount of products processed in the United States from domestic milk and butterfat with respect to which said price-support program is being undertaken; and
W H E R E A S I find and declare that the imposition of the quantitative limitations hereinafter proclaimed is shown by such investigation of the said Tariff Commission to be necessary in order that the entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption of such butter substitutes, including butter oil, will not materially interfere with the said price-support program or reduce substantially the amount of products processed in the United States from domestic milk and butterfat with respect to which the said price-support program is being under-

NOW, THEREFORE, I, DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER, President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the said section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, do hereby proclaim that the total aggregate quantity of butter substitutes, including butter oil, containing 45 per centum or more of butterfat and classifiable under paragraph 709 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, which shall be permitted to be entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption during calendar year 1957, shall not exceed 1,800,000 pounds, and that the total aggregate quantity of such articles which shall be permitted to be entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption during the calendar year 1958 and each subsequent calendar year shall not exceed 1,200,000 pounds.

2. W H E R E A S section 7 of the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1951, as amended, provides that the modification of a trade-agreement concession pursuant to such section 7 shall be for such time as is necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury to the domestic industry concerned; and
3. W H E R E A S the said further modification of the said item 763 for the period of two years ending June 30, 1957, was made with a view to a later determination of the need for continuing the said further modification beyond June 30, 1957; and
4. WHEREAS on March 14, 1957, I requested the United States Tariff Commission to make an investigation under paragraph 2 of Executive Order No. 10401 of October 14, 1952 (3 C F R , 1952 Supp. 105-6), to determine whether and to what extent the tariff quota on imports of alsike clover seed established by the said further modification will remain necessary after June 30, 1957; and
5. WHEREAS, on May 8, 1957, the United States Tariff Commission reported to me that as a result of the investigation made pursuant to my request referred to in the fourth recital of this proclamation the Commission has found that the continuation beyond June 30, 1957, of the modification of the trade-agreement concession on alsike clover seed as set forth in Proclamation No. 3100, referred to in the first recital of this proclamation, will remain necessary in order to prevent serious injury to the domestic industry concerned; and
6. W H E R E A S section 350 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended authorizes the President to proclaim such modification of existing duties and such additional import restrictions as are required or appropriate to carry out any foreign trade agreement that the President has entered into under the said section 350; and
7. W H E R E A S I find that the further modification of the concession granted in the said General Agreement with respect to alsike clover seed described in the said item 763 to permit the application to such seed of the duty treatment hereinafter proclaimed is necessary to prevent serious injury to the domestic industry producing the like or directly competitive product, and that upon such further modification of the said concession it will be appropriate to carry out the said General Agreement to apply to alsike clover seed the duty treatment hereinafter proclaimed:

WHEREAS, pursuant to section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended (7 U. S.

WHEREAS, on May 11, 1957, I caused the United States Tariff Commission to make an investigation under the said section 22 with respect to this matter; and
WHEREAS the said Tariff Commission has made such investigation and has reported to me its findings and recommendations made in connection therewith; and
W H E R E A S , on the basis of the said investigation and report of the Tariff Commission, I find that rye, rye flour, and rye meal, in the aggregate, are practically certain to be imported into the United States after June 30, 1957, under such conditions and in such (quantities as to interfere materially with and to tend to render ineffective the said price-support program with respect to rye, and to reduce substantially the amount of products processed in the United States from domestic rye with respect to which said price-support program is being undertaken; and
W H E R E A S I find and declare that the imposition of the quantitative limitations hereinafter proclaimed is shown by such investigation of the Tariff Commission to be necessary in order that the entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption after June 30, 1957, of rye, rye flour, and rye meal will not render ineffective, or materially interfere with, the said price-support program:
NOW, THEREFORE, I, DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER, President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the said section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended, do hereby proclaim that--
(1) the total aggregate quantity of rye, rye flour, and rye meal which may be entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption in each of the 12-month periods beginning July 1 in 1957 and in 1958 shall not exceed 186,000,000 pounds, of which not more than 15,000 pounds may be in the form of rye flour or rye meal, which permissible total quantities I find and declare to be proportionately not less than 50 per centum of the total quantity of such rye, rye flour, and rye meal entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption during the representative period July 1, 1950, to June 30, 1953, inclusive, and
(2) during each such 12-month period, of the foregoing permissible total quantity, not more than 182,280,000 pounds shall be imported from Canada and not more than 3,720,000 pounds shall be imported from other foreign countries.

(a) the individual shipment amounts to 100 bushels (of 56 pounds each) or less, or
(b) the individual shipment amounts to more than 100 bushels (of 56 pounds each) and the written approval of the Secretary of Agriculture or his designated representative is presented at the time of entry, or bond is furnished in a form prescribed by the Commissioner of Customs in an amount equal to the value of the merchandise as set forth in the entry, plus the estimated duty as determined at the time of entry, conditioned upon the production of such written approval within six months from the date of entry.

3. WHEREAS I have found as a fact that certain existing duties and other import restrictions of the United States of America and of the Republic of Cuba, both being contracting parties to the General Agreement, are unduly burdening and restricting the foreign trade of the United States of America and that the purposes declared in section 350 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as now amended (48 Stat.

6. W H E R E A S , pursuant to section 3 (a) of the said Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1951 (65 Stat. 72, ch. 141), I transmitted to the United States Tariff Commission for investigation and report a list of all articles imported into the United States of America to be considered for possible modification of duties and other import restrictions, imposition of additional import restrictions, or continuance of existing customs or excise treatment in the trade agreement negotiations with the governments of the foreign countries referred to in the fifth recital of this proclamation, and the Tariff Commission made an investigation in accordance with section 3 of the said Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1951 and thereafter reported to me its determinations made pursuant to the said section within the time period specified therein;

such decreases will simplify the computation of the amount of duty imposed with respect to the articles concerned; and

IMPOSING IMPORT RESTRICTIONS ON CERTAIN ARTICLES CONTAINING BUTTERFAT
BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

A PROCLAMATION

W H E R E A S , pursuant to section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment 50 Stat. 246; 65 Stat. 76; 67 Stat. 472. Act, as amended (7 U. S. C. 624), the Secretary of Agriculture advised
me there was reason to believe that certain articles containing butter-

fat, the butterfat content of which is commercially extractable, or

which are capable of being used for any edible purpose for which

products containing butterfat are used, are being or are practically

certain to be imported into the United States under such conditions

and in such quantities as to render or tend to render ineffective,

or materially interfere with, the price-support program undertaken

by the Department of Agriculture with respect to milk and butterfat,

or to reduce substantially the amount of products processed in the

United States from domestic milk and butterfat with respect to which

such program of the Department of Agriculture is being undertaken;

W H E R E A S , on M a y 21, 1957, under the authority of the said

investigation with respect to this matter;

WHEREAS, in accordance with the said section 22, as implemented by Executive Order No. 7233 of November 23, 1935, the said Tariff Commission has made such investigation and has reported to me its findings and recommendations made in connection therewith;

W H E R E A S , on the basis of the said investigation and report of the said Tariff Commission, I find that the articles with respect to which import restrictions are hereinafter proclaimed are being or are practically certain to be imported into the United States under such conditions and in such quantities as to materially interfere with the said price-support program with respect to milk and butterfat, or to reduce substantially the amount of products processed in the United States from domestic milk and butterfat with respect to which said price-support program is being undertaken;

W H E R E A S I find and declare that the import restrictions hereinafter proclaimed are shown by such investigation of the said Tariff Commission to be necessary in order that the entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption of the said articles will not materially interfere with the said price-support program or reduce substantially the amount of products processed in the United States from domestic milk and butterfat with respect to which the said price-support program is being undertaken; and

W H E R E A S I find that there is no representative period, within the meaning of the first proviso to subsection (b) of the said section 22, for imports of the said articles:
NOW, THEREFORE, I, DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER, President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the said section 22, do hereby proclaim that, effective at the close of business August 7, 1957 and thereafter, articles containing 45 percent or more of butterfat or of butterfat and other fat or oil, the butterfat content of which is commercially extractable, or which are capable of being used for any edible purpose for which products containing butterfat are used, shall not be permitted to be entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption: Provided, that this limitation shall not apply to the following articles:

1. Articles the importation of which is restricted under quotas established pursuant to section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended.

2. Cheeses the importation of which is not restricted by quotas established pursuant to the said section 22.

3. Evaporated milk and condensed milk.

4. Products imported packaged for distribution in the retail trade and ready for use by the purchaser at retail for an edible purpose or in the preparation of an edible article.

5. Articles containing butterfat and other fat or oil, if the importer establishes to the satisfaction of the collector of customs that the butterfat content thereof is less than 45 percent.

EXPLANATION
General. The following tables are designed to serve as a guide to prior laws and other Federal instruments which are patently amended, repealed, referred to, or otherwise cited by the textual provisions of the public laws and Reorganization Plans contained in Volume 71. Begmning with this volume of the United States Statutes at Large, these tables are published as an integral part of each volume. They were initiated as a separate pamphlet accompanying Volume 70, covering the enactments of the 84th Congress, second session.
From time to time the tables will be cumulated and made separately available as a convenience to users. Coverage and arrangement are subject to change with a view to improved usefulness.
The arrangement of the tables is outlined above. There are two basic groups: (1) Tables 1-10 cover amendments, repeals, and other actions directly affecting prior laws and other Federal instruments; and (2) Tables 11-19 cover all citations and other references to prior laws and other Federal instruments.
Details of Arrangement.
Tables 1-9 are limited to cases in which prior laws and other Federal instruments are expressly affected.
Table 10 is a catch-all table designed as a finding aid to relationships which are expressed in general terms. Listed in this table are all public laws in Volume 71 which contain such provisions as "notwithstanding any other provision of law," and "all laws in conflict with this law are hereby repealed."

D2

LAWS AFFECTED IN VOLUMEi 71

Tables 11-19 cover all cases in which prior laws or other Federal instruments are mentioned in the text of the public laws and reorganization plan in Volume 71, without regard to the purpose underlying such reference. Hence there is some coincidental duplication of items carried in the first group of tables.
In each of the basic groups the first and largest table is entitled "General Legislation," and contains listings of all laws affected which have not been codified in the Revised Statutes, the Internal Revenue Codes, or in those titles of the United States Code which have been enacted into positive law. Succeeding tables cover these codified provisions, as well as other instruments such as Reorganization Plans, Veterans' Regulations, Executive Orders and Proclamations, and Treaties and International Agreements. The numbering of the tables in the two groups is parallel. Thus Table 2 and Table 12 both relate to the Revised Statutes; Table 7 and Table 17 both relate to Veterans' Regulations.
Table 1 is arranged chronologically. In preparing this table the "basic act"
f)rinciple has been followed. Under this principle the key listing of amendatory
egislation will be found under the basic act affected, rather than under intervening amendments thereto. Furthermore, all laws included are treated as if tables covering prior volumes of the United States Statutes at Large were in existence. Thus, no attempt is made to give an historical picture of a law, and only the latest amendment in the chain will be reflected. Occasionally, in cases of extreme confusion, cross references have been supplied at key points.
Users of Table 1 should, therefore, look under the date or statutes volume and page number of the basic act affected, in order to determine whether changes have been made by the public laws contained in Volume 71. Although a given section of any act may have been added at a later date, the section is carried under the date and statutes citation of the basic act. For this reason the page numbers in the column headed "Statutes volume and page" are the numbers of the page on which each act begins.
All tables are arranged chronologically, except where the existence of a system of codification makes possible a sequential arrangement from the lowest to the highest title or section number. In Tables 1-10 there is a "Comment" column, in which the nature of the affecting action is described. These comments are intended to reflect what is patent in the laws reviewed, and every effort has been made to avoid interpretations.
In Tables 11-19 the "Comment" column is unnecessai^, since in each instance the comment would be "Cited" or "Referred to." In these tables, moreover, the number of columns has been held to a minimum in the interest of brevity. Thus Table 11 contains onlv three columns listing the date and number of the law referred to, and the page number in Volume 71 at which the reference may be found.
Caveat.
All of the tables are editorially compiled and presented solely as guides to the user. Hence they have no evidentiary status or legal effect. They do not cover indirect or implied relationships which may be found through use of the subject index or through research based on the text itself.
The Federal Register Division invites criticisms or suggestions with a view to improving the tables wherever possible.
