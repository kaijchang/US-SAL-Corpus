shall revert to the nation or tribe of Indians from which the same shall have been taken.
Sec . 3. That before said railway shall be constructed through any lands held by individual occupants according to the laws, customs, and usages of any of the Indian nations or tribes through which it may be constructed, or by allotments under any law of the United States or agreement with the Indians, full compensation shall be made to such occupants for all property to be taken or damage done by reason of the construction of such railway. In case of failure to make amicable settlement with any occupant, such compensation shall be determined by the appraisement of three disinterested referees, to be appointed, one (who shall act as chairman) by the President, one by the chief of the nation to which said occupant belongs, or, in case of an allottee, by said allottee or by his duly authorized guardian or representative, and one by said railway company, who, before entering upon the duties of their appointment, shall take and subscribe, before a district judge, clerk of a district court, or United States commissioner, an oath that they will faithfully and impartially discharge the duties of their appointment, which oath, duly certified, shall be returned with their award to and filed with the Secretary of the Interior within sixty days from the completion thereof; and a majority of said referees shall be competent to act in case of the absence of a member, after due notice. And upon the failure of either party to make such appointment within thirty days after the appointment made by the President, the vacancy shall be filled by the district judge of any United States court iu the Indian Territory, or the Territory of Oklahoma, upon the application of the other party. Tbe chairman of said board shall appoint the time and place for all hearings within the nation to which such occupant belongs. Each of said referees shall receive for his services the sum of four dollars per day for each day they are engaged in the trial of any case submitted to them under this Act, with mileage at five cents per mile actually traveled. Witnesses shall receive the usual fees allowed by the courts of said nations and the courts of Oklahoma Territory. Costs, including compensation of the referees, shall be made a part of the award, and be paid by such railway company. In case the referees can not agree, then any two of them are authorized to make the award. Either party being dissatisfied with the finding of the referees shall have the right, within ninety days after making the award and notice of the same, to appeal by original petition to any district court in the Indian Territory, or Oklahoma Territory, which court shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine the subject-matter of said petition. If, upon the hearing of said appeal, the judgment of the court shall be for a larger sum than the award of the referees, the cost of said appeal shall be adjudged against the railway company. If the judgment of the court shall be for the same sum as the award of the referees, then the cost shall be adjudged against the appellant. If the judgment of the court shall be for a smaller sum than the award of the referees, then the costs shall be adjudged against the party claiming damages. When proceedings have been commenced in court, the railway company shall pay double the amount of the award into court to abide the judgment thereof, and then have the right to enter upon the property sought to be condemned and proceed with the construction of the railway.
Sec . 4. That said railway company shall not charge the inhabitants of said Territories a greater rate of freight than the rate authorized by the laws of the State of Kansas for services or transportation of the same kind: Provided, That passenger rates on said railway shall not exceed three cents per mile. Congress hereby reserves the right to regulate the charges for freight and passengers on said railway and messages on said telegraph and telephone lines, until a State government or governments shall exist in said Territories within the limits of which said railway, or a part thereof, shall be located; and then such State government or governments shall be authorized to fix and regulate the cost of transportation of persons and freights within their

respective limits by said railway; but Congress expressly reserves the right to fix and regulate, at all times, the cost of such transportation by said railway or said company whenever such transportation shall extend from one State into another, or shall extend into more than one State: Provided, however, That the rate of such transportation of passengers, local or interstate, shall not exceed the rate above expressed: And provided further, That said railway company shall carry the mail at such prices as Congress may by law provide; and until such rate is fixed by law the Postmaster-General may fix the rate of compensation.
Sec . 5. That said railway company shall pay to the Secretary of the Interior, for the benefit of the particular nations or tribes or individuals through whose lands said line may be located, the sum of fifty dollars, in addition to compensation provided for in this Act, for property taken and damages done to individual occupants by the construction of the railway for each mile of railway that it may construct in said Territories, said payments to be made in installments of five hundred dollars as each ten miles of road is graded: Provided, That if the general council of either of the nations or tribes through whose land said railway may be located shall, within four months after the filing of maps of definite location as set forth in section six of this Act, dissent from the allowance provided for in this section, and shall certify the same to the Secretary of the Interior, then all compensation to be paid to such dissenting nation or tribe under the provisions of this Act shall be determined as provided in section three for the determination of the compensation to be paid to the individual occupant of lands, with the right of appeal to the courts upon the same terms, conditions, and requirements as therein provided: Provided further, That the amount awarded or adjudged to be paid by the said railway company for dissenting nation or tribe shall be in lieu of the compensation that said nation or tribe would be entitled to receive under the foregoing provision. Said company shall also pay, so long as said Territories are owned and occupied by the Indians, to the Secretary of the Interior, the sum of fifteen dollars per annum for each mile of railway it shall construct in the said Territories. The money paid to the Secretary of the Interior under the provisions of this Act shall be apportioned by him in accordance with the laws and treaties now in force among the different nations and tribes according to the number of miles of railway that may be constructed by said railway company through their lands: Provided, That Congress shall have the right, so long as said lands are occupied and possessed by said nations and tribes, to impose such additional taxes upon said railway as it may deem just and proper for their benefit; and any Territory or State hereafter formed through which said railway shall have been established may exercise the like power as to such part of said railway as may lie within its limits. Said railway company shall have the right to survey and locate its railway immediately after the passage of this Act.
Sec . 6. That said company shall cause maps, showing the route of its located lines through said Territories, to be filed in the office of the Secretary of the Interior, and also to be filed in the office of the principal chiefs of each of the nations or tribes through whose lands said railway may be located; and after the filing of said maps no claim for a subsequent settlement and improvement upon the right of way shown by said maps shall be valid as against said company: Provided, That a map showing the entire line of the road in the Indian Territory shall be filed and approved before the work of construction shall commence.
Sec . 7. That the officers, servants, and employees of said company necessary to the construction and management of said railway shall be allowed to reside, while so engaged, upon such right of way, but subject to the provisions of the Indian intercourse laws, and such rules and regulations as may be established by the Secretary of the Interior in accordance with said intercourse laws.

"Art . 15. All signals prescribed by this article for vessels under way shall be given:
"First. By `steam vessels' on the whistle or siren. "Second. By `sailing vessels' and `vessels towed' on the fog horn. "The words `prolonged blast' used in this article shall mean a blast of from four to six seconds duration. "A steam vessel shall be provided with an efficient whistle or siren, sounded by steam or by some substitute for steam, so placed that the sound may not be intercepted by any obstruction, and with an efficient fog horn, to be sounded by mechanical means, and also with an efficient bell. (In all cases where the rules require a bell to be used a drum may be substituted on board Turkish vessels, or a gong where such articles are used on board small seagoing vessels.) A sailing vessel of twenty tons gross tonnage or upward shall be provided with a similar fog horn and bell. "In fog, mist, falling snow, or heavy rainstorms, whether by day or night, the signals described in this article shall be used as follows, namely: " (a) A steam vessel having way upon her shall sound, at intervals of not more than two minutes, a prolonged blast. " (b) A steam vessel under way, but stopped, and having no way upon her, shall sound, at intervals of not more than two minutes, two prolonged blasts, with an interval of about one second between. "(c) A sailing vessel under way shall sound, at intervals of not more than one minute, when on the starboard tack, one blast; when on the port tack, two blasts in succession, and when with the wind abaft the beam, three'blasts in succession. " (d) A vessel when at anchor shall, at intervals of not more than one minute, ring the bell rapidly for about five seconds. " (e) A vessel when towing, a vessel employed in laying or in picking up a telegraph cable, and a vessel under way, which is unable to get out of the way of an approaching vessel through being not under command, or unable to maneuver as required by the rules, shall, instead of the signals prescribed in subdivisions (a) and (c) of this article, at intervals of not more than two minutes, sound three blasts in succession, namely: One prolonged blast followed by two short blasts. A vessel towed may give this signal and she shall not give any other. " Sailing vessels and boats of less than twenty tons gross tonnage shall not be obliged to give the above-mentioned signals, but, if they do not, they shall make some other efficient sound signal at intervals of not more than one minute."

"The words `prolonged blast' used in this article shall mean a blast of from four to six seconds duration. "A steam vessel shall be provided with an efficient whistle or siren, sounded by steam or by some substitute for steam, so placed that the sound may not be intercepted by any obstruction, and with an efficient fog horn, to be sounded by mechanical means, and also with an efficient bell. (In all cases where the rules require a bell to be used a drum may be substituted on board Turkish vessels, or a gong where such articles are used on board small seagoing vessels.) A sailing vessel of twenty tons gross tonnage or upward shall be provided with a similar fog horn and bell. "In fog, mist, falling snow, or heavy rainstorms, whether by day or night, the signals described in this article shall be used as follows, namely: " (a) A steam vessel having way upon her shall sound, at intervals of not more than two minutes, a prolonged blast. " (b) A steam vessel under way, but stopped, and having no way upon her, shall sound, at intervals of not more than two minutes, two prolonged blasts, with an interval of about one second between. "(c) A sailing vessel under way shall sound, at intervals of not more than one minute, when on the starboard tack, one blast; when on the port tack, two blasts in succession, and when with the wind abaft the beam, three'blasts in succession. " (d) A vessel when at anchor shall, at intervals of not more than one minute, ring the bell rapidly for about five seconds. " (e) A vessel when towing, a vessel employed in laying or in picking up a telegraph cable, and a vessel under way, which is unable to get out of the way of an approaching vessel through being not under command, or unable to maneuver as required by the rules, shall, instead of the signals prescribed in subdivisions (a) and (c) of this article, at intervals of not more than two minutes, sound three blasts in succession, namely: One prolonged blast followed by two short blasts. A vessel towed may give this signal and she shall not give any other. " Sailing vessels and boats of less than twenty tons gross tonnage shall not be obliged to give the above-mentioned signals, but, if they do not, they shall make some other efficient sound signal at intervals of not more than one minute."

That said bridge shall not interfere with the free navigation of said river, and in case of any litigation arising from any obstruction or alleged obstruction to the free navigation of said river, by reason of the construction of said bridge, the cause maybe tried before the circuit court of the United States in and for any district in whose jurisdiction any portion of said obstruction or bridge may be. Said bridge shall be constructed to provide for the passage of railroad trains.
Sec . 2. That said bridge shall be provided with one or more draw openings, each having not less than one hundred feet clear channel way at low water, and in addition to said draw openings one or more fixed channel spans, each having not less than one hundred feet clear channel way; and every part of the superstructure of said bridge shall give a clear headroom of not less than ten feet above extreme known highwater mark: Provided, That all spans shall be so located as to afford the greatest possible accommodation to the river traffic and a draw opening shall, if practicable, be located next or near shore: Provided also, That if the physical characteristics of the locality so require, and the interest of navigation be not injured thereby, the lengths of the fixed spans or the number of draw openings may be reduced: Provided also, That for any two adjacent draw openings of one hundred feet each one draw opening of two hundred feet or more may be substituted if, in the opinion of the Secretary of War, the interest of navigation be not injured thereby.
Sec . 3. That all draw spans authorized by this Act shall be operated by steam or other reliable power and shall be opened promptly upon reasonable signal for the passage of boats, except when trains are passing over said span or spans; but in no case shall unnecessary delay occur in opening said draw after the passage of trains; and also that in case the opening of a draw is delayed by reason of the passing of a train after the signal has been given from a boat ready to pass through the draw shall be opened for the passage of such boat before another train is allowed to pass over the said span or spans; nor shall there be any unnecessary delay in the passage of trains over the bridge.

above and below the bridge site, and for the guiding of rafts, steam-

boats, and other water craft safely under or through said bridge; and

if at any time after the construction of the bridge and its accessory

works the approaches to draw openings, channel spans, or raft pas-

sages in said bridge are found to be dangerous or difficult of access by

river traffic the Secretary of War may, upon the recommendation of

the Chief of Engineers, United States Army, order the corporation,

company, or persons owning, controlling, or operating said bridge to con-

struct, under his directions, and to maintain such additional sheer

booms, dikes, and other devices as will obviate the difficulty mentioned,

A PROCLAMATION.

Preamble. Vol. 27, p. 947. Contractingparties.

Whereas, a Convention between the Governments of the United States of America and Great Britain, providing for the settlement of claims presented by Great Britain against the United States in virtue of the Convention of February 29, 1892, between the same High Contracting Parties, was concluded and signed by their respective Plenipotentiaries at the City of Washington, on the eighth day of February, 1896, which Convention, being in the English language, and as amended by the
Senate of the United States, is word for word as follows: Whereas by a Treaty between the United States of America and
Her Majesty the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, signed at Washington on February 29, 1892, the questions which had arisen between their respective Governments concerning
the jurisdictional rights of the United States in the waters of Behring Sea, and concerning also the preservation of the fur-seal in, or habitually resorting to, the said Sea, and the rights of the citizens and subjects of either country as regards the taking of fur-seal in, or habitually resorting to, the said waters, were submitted to a Tribunal of Arbitration
as therein constituted; And whereas the High Contracting Parties having found themselves
unable to agree upon a reference which should include the question of the liability of each for the injuries alleged to have been sustained by the other, or by its citizens, in connection with the claims presented and urged by' it, did, by Article VIII of the said Treaty, agree that either party might submit to the Arbitrators any questions of fact involved in said claims and ask for a finding thereon, the question of the liability of either Government on the facts found to be the subject
of further negotiations; And whereas the Agent of Great Britain did, in accordance with the
provisions of said Article VIII, submit to the Tribunal of Arbitration certain findings of fact which were agreed to as proved by the Agent of the United States, and the Arbitrators did unanimously find the
facts so set forth to be true, as appears by the Award of the Tribunal rendered on the 15th day of August, 1893;
And whereas in view of the said findings of fact and of the decision of the Tribunal of Arbitration concerning the jurisdictional rights of the United States in Behring Sea and the right of protection or prop-
erty of the United States in the fur-seals frequenting the islands of the United States in Behring Sea, the Government of the United States is desirous that in so far as its liability is not already fixed and
determined by the findings of fact and the decision of said Tribunal

CONVENTION--GREAT BRITAIN. June 11, 1896.

845

of Arbitration, the question of such liability should be definitely and fully settled and determined, and compensation made, for any injuries for which, in the contemplation of the Treaty aforesaid, and the award
and findings of the Tribunal of Arbitration compensation may be due to great Britain from the United States;
And whereas it is claimed by Great Britain, though not admitted by
the United States, that prior to the said award certain other claims against the United States accrued in favor of Great Britain on account of seizures of or interference with the following named British sealing vessels,--to wit, the "Wanderer," the "Winnifred," the "Henrietta" and the "Oscar and Hattie," and it is for the mutual nterest and con-
venience of both the High Contracting Parties that the liability of the United States, if any, and the amount of compensation to be paid, if any, iu respect of such claims and each of them should also be deter-
mined under the jirovisions of this Convention--all claims by Great Britain under Article V of the Modus Vivendi of April 18, 1892 for
the abstention from fishing of British sealers during the pendency of said arbitration having been definitely waived before the Tribunal of Arbitration:
The United States of America and Her Majesty the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, to the end of concluding a Convention for that purpose, have appointed as their respective Plenipotentiaries:
The President of the United States, the Honorable Richard Olney, Secretary of State; and Her Majesty the Queen of the United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Ireland, the Right Honorable Sir Julian Pauncefote, G. C. B., G. C. M. G., Her Majesty's Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the United States;
Who, after having communicated to each other their respective full powers, which were found in due and proper form, have agreed to and concluded the following Articles:

Whereas: The Congress of the United States passed an Act which

was approved on the sixteenth day of July, eighteen hundred and ninety

four, entitled "An Act to enable the people of Utah to form a Consti-

tution and State Government and to be admitted into the Union on an

equal footing with the original States," which Act provided for the

election of delegates to a Constitutional Convention to meet, at the

seat of government of the Territory of Utah, on the first Monday in

March eighteen hundred and ninety-five, for the purpose of declaring

the adoption of the Constitution of the United States by the people of

the proposed State and forming a Constitution and State Government

for such State;

And whereas, delegates were accordingly elected who met, organized

and declared on behalf of the people of said proposed State their

adoption of the Constitution of the United States, all as provided in

said Act;



And whereas, said Convention, so organized, did, by ordinance irre-

vocable without the consent of the United States and the people of said

State, as required by said Act, provide that perfect toleration of reli-

gious sentiment shall be secured and that no inhabitant of said State

shall ever be molested in person or property on account of his or her

are forever prohibited; and did also by said ordinance make the other

various stipulations recited in Section Three of said Act;

And whereas, said Convention thereupon formed a Constitution and

State government for said proposed State, which Constitution, includ-

ing said Ordinance, was duly submitted to the people thereof at an

election held on the Tuesday next after the first Monday of November,

Aud whereas, the return of said election has been made and canvassed

and the result thereof certified to me, together with a statement of the

vided in said Act, showing that a majority of the votes lawfully cast at

Whereas, in a suit between the United States and the State of Texas, involving the title to, and jurisdiction over, all that territory lying be- .
tween the North and South forks of the Red River, and the one hun-

dredth degree of longitude, known and styled as "Greer County, Texas,"

the Supreme Court of the United States has decided that the title to,

and jurisdiction over, said territory is vested in the United States; and,

Whereas, The Choctaw Nation claims that the title to these lands

passed to said Nation by virtue of treaties with the United States, and

that the title of said Nation to said lands has not been extinguished,

but that said Choctaw Nation has a right and interest therein; and

Whereas, it is claimed that divers persons settled upon said lands

prior to the thirtieth day of December, eighteen hundred and eighty-

seven, acting in good faith, upon the belief that the same belonged to

and were subject to the jurisdiction of the State of Texas, and that

Congress will be asked to extend to all such settlers suitable relief;

G-reer County, Okla. Now, Therefore, I, Grover Cleveland, President of the United States,

by virtue of the authority in me vested, not admitting in any wise the

validity of such claim'on behalf of the Choctaw Nation, but for the

purpose of preserving the status of said lands intact until such time

as said claim of the Choctaw Nation thereto may be duly determined,

Lands withdrawn and that the settlers hereinbefore referred to shall not be disturbed

from entry.

until Congress shall have fully considered their claims for relief, do

hereby withdraw said lands from disposition under the public land

laws of the United States, and declare the same to be in a state of res-

ervation, until such time as this order of withdrawal may be revoked;

Persons warned not and 1 do further warn and admonish all persons against entering upon

Whereas, in a suit between the United States and the State of Texas, involving the title to, and jurisdiction over, all that territory lying be- .
tween the North and South forks of the Red River, and the one hun-

dredth degree of longitude, known and styled as "Greer County, Texas,"

the Supreme Court of the United States has decided that the title to,

and jurisdiction over, said territory is vested in the United States; and,

Whereas, The Choctaw Nation claims that the title to these lands

passed to said Nation by virtue of treaties with the United States, and

that the title of said Nation to said lands has not been extinguished,

but that said Choctaw Nation has a right and interest therein; and

Whereas, it is claimed that divers persons settled upon said lands

prior to the thirtieth day of December, eighteen hundred and eighty-

seven, acting in good faith, upon the belief that the same belonged to

and were subject to the jurisdiction of the State of Texas, and that

Congress will be asked to extend to all such settlers suitable relief;

G-reer County, Okla. Now, Therefore, I, Grover Cleveland, President of the United States,

by virtue of the authority in me vested, not admitting in any wise the

validity of such claim'on behalf of the Choctaw Nation, but for the

purpose of preserving the status of said lands intact until such time

as said claim of the Choctaw Nation thereto may be duly determined,

Lands withdrawn and that the settlers hereinbefore referred to shall not be disturbed

from entry.

until Congress shall have fully considered their claims for relief, do

hereby withdraw said lands from disposition under the public land

laws of the United States, and declare the same to be in a state of res-

ervation, until such time as this order of withdrawal may be revoked;

Persons warned not and 1 do further warn and admonish all persons against entering upon

said lands with a view to occupying the same, or settling thereon under

the public land laws, during the existence of this order.

Preamble. November 26, 1896, set apart as a day of national thanksgiving.

The people of the United States should never be unmindful of the gratitude they owe the God of Nations for His watchful care which has shielded them from dire disaster and pointed out to them the way of peace and happiness. Nor should they ever refuse to acknowledge with contrite hearts, their proneness to turn away from God's teachings, and to follow with sinful pride after their own devices.
To the end that these thoughts may be quickened, it is fitting that on a day especially appointed, we should join together in approaching the
Throne of Grace with praise and supplication. Therefore, I, Grover Cleveland, President of the United States, do
hereby designate and set apart Thursday the twenty-sixth day of the present month of November, to be kept and observed as a day of Thanksgiving and Prayer throughout our land.
On that day let all our people forego their usual work and occupation, and, assembled in their accustomed places of worship, let them with one accord render thanks to the Buler of the Universe for our preservation as a nation and our deliverance from every threatened danger; for the peace that has dwelt within our boundaries; for our defense against disease and pestilence during the year that has passed; for the plenteous rewards that have followed the labors of our husbandmen, and for all the other blessings that have been vouchsafed to us.
And let us, through the mediation of Him who has taught us how to pray, implore the forgiveness of our sins and a continuation of Heavenly favor.
Let us not forget on this day of thanksgiving, the poor and needy; and by deeds of charity let our offerings of praise be made more acceptable iu the sight of the Lord.

Whereas by a proclamation dated the twelfth day of June, A. D. 1895, attention was called to the serious civil disturbances accompanied by armed resistance to the established government of Spain then prevailing
in the Island of Cuba, and citizens of the United States and all other persons were admonished to abstain from taking part in such disturb-
ances in contravention of the neutrality laws of the United States; and Whereas said civil disturbances and armed resistance to the authority
of Spain, a power with which the United States are on terms of peace and amity, continue to prevail in said Island of Cuba; and
Whereas since the date of said proclamation said neutrality laws of
the United States have been the subject of authoritative exposition by the judicial tribunal of last resort, and it has thus been declared that any combination of persons organized in the United States for the pur-
pose of proceeding to and making wax upon a foreign country with which the United States are at peace and provided with arms to be used for such purpose constitutes a " military expedition or enterprise" within
the meaning of said neutrality laws, and that the providing or preparing of the means for such "'military expedition or enterprise," which is
expressly prohibited by said laws, includes furnishing or aiding in transportation for such " military expedition or enterprise;" and
Whereas by express enactment, if two or more persons conspire to commit an offence against the United States, any act of one conspirator to effect the object of such conspiracy renders all the conspirators liable
to fine and imprisonment; and Whereas there is reason to believe that citizens of the United States
and others within their jurisdiction fail to apprehend the meaning and
operation of the neutrality laws of the United States as authoritatively interpreted as aforesaid and may be misled into participation in transactions which are violations of said laws and will render them liable to the severe penalties provided for such violations;
Now, Therefore, that the laws above referred to as judicially construed may be duly executed, that the international obligations of the United States may be fully satisfied, and that their citizens and all others within their jurisdiction, being seasonably apprised of their legal
duty in the premises, may abstain from disobedience to the laws of the United States and thereby escape the forfeitures and penalties legally
consequent thereon; I, Grover Cleveland, President of the United States, do hereby sol-
emnly warn all citizens of the United States and all others within their jurisdiction against violations of the said laws interpreted as hereinbefore explained and give notice that all such violations will be vigorously prosecuted. And I do hereby invoke the co-operation of all good

Whereas on June 21, 1890, the President of the United States by proclamation reserved certain lands in Juneau and Douglas City, Fort Wrangel and Sitka, in the Territory of Alaska for public buildings, barracks, parade grounds, parks, wharves, coaling stations, etc., which are fully set forth and particularly described in said proclamation.
And Whereas, a treaty of cession was exchanged and proclaimed on June 20, 1867, whereby the Russian Empire ceded to the United
States the Territory of Alaska. And Whereas said treaty, by Article II, provided inter alia that: "It is, however, understood and agreed that the churches, which
have been built in the ceded territory by the Russian government,
shall remain the property of such members of the Greek Oriental Church resident in the territory, as may choose to worship therein."
And Whereas there were included among the lands, hereinbefore referred to as reserved on June 21, 1890, certain lands in and about the town of Sitka, in said territory of Alaska, which are claimed by the Holy Orthodox Catholic Apostolic Oriental Church, commonly styled the Greco-Russian Church, and described in the said treaty as
the Greek Oriental Church. Now, Therefore, I, Grover Cleveland, President of the United States,
by virtue of the authority in me vested, do hereby declare, proclaim,
and make known that the Executive Order of June 21, 1890, making said reservations of lands in the Territory of Alaska, therein particularly described, is hereby modified, and said reservations are diminished,
so that the following property, described in inventory B, attached to and referred to in the protocol of transfer, signed by the representative of Russia aud the United States on October 26,1867, and being in and about the town of Sitka aforesaid, be excluded therefrom, to wit:
The Cathedral Church of St. Michael, built of timber, situated in the

Revocation of proclamation suspending collection of tonnage duty oil vessels from Germany.
Effect.

Whereas, by a proclamation of the President of the United States,

dated January twenty-sixth, eighteen hundred and eighty-eight, upon

proof then appearing satisfactory that no tonnage or light-house dues

or any equivalent tax or taxes whatever were imposed upon American

vessels entering the ports of the Empire of Germany, either by the

Imperial Government or by the Governments of the German Maritime

States, and that vessels belonging to the United States of America

and their cargoes were not required in German ports to pay any fee or

due of any kind or nature, or any import due higher or other than was

payable by German vessels or their cargoes in the United States, the

President did thereby declare and proclaim, from and after the date of

his said Proclamation of January twenty-sixth, eighteen hundred and

eighty-eight, the suspension of the collection of the whole of the duty

of six cents per ton, not to exceed thirty cents per ton per annum,

imposed upon vessels entered in the ports of the United States from

any of the ports of the Empire of Germany by section 11 of the Act of

Congress approved June nineteenth, eighteen hundred and eighty-six,

entitled "An Act to abolish certain fees for official services to American

vessels and to amend the laws relating to shipping commissioners, sea-

men aud owners of vessels and for other purposes";

And whereas the President did further declare and proclaim in his

Proclamation of January twenty-sixth, eighteen hundred and eighty-

eight that the said suspension should continue so long as the reciprocal

exemption of vessels belonging to citizens of the United States and

their cargoes should be continued in the said ports of the Empire of

Germany and no longer;

And whereas, it now appears upon satisfactory proof that tonnage

or light-house dues or a tax or taxes equivalent thereto are in fact

imposed upon American vessels and their cargoes entered in German

ports higher and other than those imposed upon German vessels or

their cargoes entered in ports of the United States, so that said Proc-

lamation of January twenty-sixth, eighteen hundered and eighty-eight

in its operation and effect contravenes the meaning and intent of said

section 11 of the Act of Congress approved June nineteenth, eighteen

hundred and eighty-six:

Now, therefore, I, Grover Cleveland, President of the United States

of America, by virtue of the aforesaid section 11 of the Act aforesaid

as well as in pursuance of the terms of said Proclamation itself, do

hereby revoke my said Proclamation of January twenty-sixth, eighteen

hundred and eighty-eight suspending the collection of the whole of the

duty of six cents per ton, not to exceed thirty cents per ton per annum

(which is imposed by the aforesaid section of said Act) upon vessels

entered in the ports of the United States from any of the ports of the

German Empire; this revocation of said Proclamation to take effect on

and after the second day of January, eighteen hundred and ninety-

seven.

In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal

December 31, 1896.

A PROCLAMATION.

Whereas an act of Congress entitled "An Act To adopt regulations for preventing collisions at sea," was approved August 19, 1890, the said Act being in the following words:
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the following regulations for preventing collisions at sea shall he followed by all public and private vessels of the United States upon the high seas and in all waters connected therewith, navigable by sea-going vessels.

Preamble. Vol. 26, p. 320.
Collisions at sea. Act prescribing regulations for preventing.

PRELIMINARY.

In the following rules every steam-vessel which is under sail and not under steam is to be considered a sailing-vessel, and every vessel under steam, whether under sail or not, is to be considered a steam-vessel.
The word "steam-vessel" shall include any vessel propelled by machinery. A vessel is "under way" within the meaning of these rules when she is not at anchor, or made fast to the shore, or aground.
RULES CONCERNING LIGHTS, AND SO FORTH.

Lights.

The word "visible" in these rules when applied to lights shall mean visible on a
dark night with a clear atmosphere. Arti cle 1. The rules concerning lights shall be complied with in all weathers from
sunset to sunrise, and during such time no other lights which may be mistaken for the prescribed lights shall be exhibited.
Art . 2. A steam-vessel when under way shall carry--(a) On or in front of the foremast, or if a vessel without a foremast, then in the fore part of the vessel, at a height above the hull of not less than twenty feet, aud if the breadth of the vessel exceeds twenty feet, then at a height above the hull not less than such breadth, so, however, that the light need not be carried at a greater height above the hull than forty feet, a bright white light, so constructed as to show an unbroken light over an arc of the horizon of twenty points of the compass, so fixed as to throw the light ten points on each side of the vessel, namely, from right ahead to two points abaft the beam on either side, and of such a character as to be visible at a distance of at least five miles.
(b) On the starboard side a green light so constructed as to show an unbroken light over an arc of the horizon of ten points of the compass, so fixed as to throw the light from right ahead to two points abaft the beam on the starboard side, and of such a character as to be visible at a distance of at least two miles.
(c) On the port side a red light so constructed as to show an unbroken light over an arc of the horizon often points of the compass, so fixed as to throw the light from right ahead to two points abaft the beam on the port side, and of such a character as to be visible at a distance of at least two miles.
(d) The said green and red side-lights shall be fitted with inboard screens projecting at least three feet forward from the light, so as to prevent these lights from being
seen across the bow. (e) A steam-vessel when under way may carry an additional white light similar
in construction to the light mentioned in subdivision (a). These two lights shall be so placed in line with the keel that one shall be at least fifteen feet higher than the other, and in such a position with reference to each other that the lower light shall be forward of the upper one. The vertical distance between these lights shall be less than the horizontal distance.
Art . 3. A steam-vessel when towing another vessel shall, in addition to her sidelights, carry two bright white lights in a vertical line one over the other, not less than six feet apart, and when towing more than one vessel shall carry an additional bright white light six feet above or below such light, if the length of the tow measuring from the stern of the towing vessel to the stern of the last vessel towed exceeds six hundred feet. Each of these lights shall be of the same construction and character, and shall be carried in the same position as the white light mentioned in article two (a), excepting the additional light, which may be carried at a height of not less than fourteen feet above the hull.
Such steam-vessel may carry a small white light abaft the funnel or aftermast for the vessel towed to steer by, but such light shall not be visible forward of the beam.
Art . 4. (a) A vessel which from any accident is not under command shall carry at the same height as a white light mentioned in article two (a), w'here they can best be seen, and if a steam-vessel in lieu of that light, two red lights, in a vertical line one over the other, not less than six feet apart, and of such a character as to be visible all around the horizon at a distance of at least two miles; and shall by day carry in a vertical line one over the other, not less than six feet apart, where they can best be seen, two black balls or shapes, each two feet in diameter.
(b) A vessel employed in laying or in picking up a telegraph cable shall carry in the same position as the white light mentioned in article two (a), and if a

steam-vessel in lieu of that light, three lights in a vertical line one over the other not less than six feet apart. The highest and lowest of these lights shall be red, and the middle light shall be white, and they shall be of such a character as to be visible all around the horizon, at a distance of at least two miles. By day she shall carry in a vertical line, one over the other, not less than six feet apart, where they can best be seen, three shapes not less than two feet in diameter, of which the highest and lowest shall be globular in shape and red in color, and the middle one diamond in shape and white.
(c) The vessels referred to in this article, when not making way through the water, shall not carry the side-lights, but when making way shall carry them.
(d) The lights and shapes required to be shown by this article are to be taken by other vessels as signals that the vessel showing them is not under command and can not therefore get out of the way.
These signals are not signals of vessels in distress and requiring assistance. Such signals are contained iu article thirty-one.
Art . 5. A sailing vessel underway and any vessel being towed shall carry the same lights as are prescribed by article two for a steam-vessel under way, with the exception of the white lights mentioned therein, which they shall never carry.
Art . 6. Whenever, as in the case of small vessels under way during bad weather, the green and red side-lights can not be fixed, these lights shall be kept at hand, lighted and ready for use; and shall, on the approach of or to other vessels, be exhibited on their respective sides in sufficient time to prevent collision, in such manner as to make them most visible, and so that the green light shall not be seen on the port side nor the red light on the starboard side, nor, if practicable, more than two points abaft the beam on their respective sides.
To make the use of these portable lights more certain and easy the lanterns containing them shall each be painted outside with the color of the light they respectively contain, and shall be provided with proper screens.
Art . 7. Steam-vessels of less than forty, and vessels under oars or sails of less than twenty tons, gross tonnage, respectively, when under way, shall not be obliged to carry the lights mentioned in article two (a) (b) and (c), but if they do not carry them they shall be provided with the following lights:
First. Steam-vessels of less than forty tons shall carry-- (a) In the fore part of the vessel, or on or in front of the funnel, where it can best be seen, and ata height above the gunwale of not less than nine feet, a bright white light constructed and fixed as prescribed in article two (a), and of such a character as to be visible at a distance of at least two miles. (b) Green and red side-lights constructed and fixed as prescribed in article two (b; and (c), and of such a character as to be visible at a distance of at least one mile, or a combined lantern showing a green light and a red light from right ahead to two points abaft the beam on their respective sides. Such lanterns shall be carried not less than three feet below the white light. Second. Small steam-boats, such as are carried by sea-going vessels, may carry the white light at a less height than nine feet above the the gunwale, but it shall be carried above the combined lantern mentioned in subdivision one (b). Third. Vessels under oars or sails, of less than twenty tons, shall have ready at hand a lantern with a green glass on one side and a red glass on the other, which, on the approach of or to other vessels, shall be exhibited in sufficient time to prevent collision, so that the green light shall not be seen on the port side nor the red light on the starboard side. The vessels referred to in this article shall not be obliged to carry the lights prescribed by article four (a) and article eleven, last paragraph. Art . 8. Pilot vessels when engaged on their station on pilotage duty shall not show the lights required for other vessels, but shall carry a white light at the masthead, visible all around the horizon, and shall also exhibit a flare-up light or flare-up lights at short intervals, which shall never exceed fifteen minutes. Ou the near approach of or to other vessels they shall have their side-lights lighted, ready for use, and shall flash or show them at short intervals, to indicate the direction in which they are heading, but the green light shall not be shown on the port side, nor the red light on the starboard side. A pilot-vessel of such a class as to be obliged to go alongside of a vessel to put a pilot on board may show the white light instead of carrying it at the masthead, and may, instead of the colored lights above mentioned, have at hand, ready for use, a lantern with a green glass on the one side and a red glass on the other, to be used as prescribed above. Pilot-vessels when not engaged on their station on pilotage duty shall carry lights similar to those of other vessels of their tonnage. Art . 9. Fishing vessels and fishing boats when under way and when not required by this article to carry or show the lights therein named shall carry or show the lights prescribed for vessels of their tonnage under way. (a) Vessels and boats, when fishing with drift nets, shall exhibit two white lights from any part of the vessel where they can best be seen. Such lights shall be placed so that the vertical distance between them shall be not less than six feet and not more than ten feet, and so that the horizontal distance between them, measured in aline with the keel, shall be not less than five feet and not more than ten feet. The lower of these two lights shall be the more forward, and both of them shall be of such a character as to show all around the horizon, and to be visible at a distance of not less than three miles.

Continued.

First. If steam-vessels, shall carry in the same position as the white light men-

tioned in article two (a) a tricolored lantern so constructed and fixed as to show a

white light from right ahead to two points on each bow, and a green light and a

red light over an arc of the horizon from two points on either bow to two points

abaft the beam on the starboard and port sides, respectively ; aud, not less than six

nor more than twelve feet below the tricolored lantern, a, white light in a lantern, so

constructed as to show a clear, uniform, and unbroken light all around the horizon

Second. If sailing vessels, of seven tons gross tonnage and upwards, shall carry a

white light in a lantern, so constructed as to show a clear, uniform, and unbroken

light all around the horizon, and shall also be provided with a sufficient supply of

red pyrotechnic lights, which shall each burn for at least thirty seconds, and shall

be shown on the approach of or to other vessels in sufficient time to prevent

collision. In the Mediterranean Sea the vessels referred to in subdivision (b) two may use a

flare-up light in lieu of a pyrotechnic light. All lights mentioned in subdivision (b) one and two shall be visible at a distance

of at least two miles. Third. If sailing vessels of less than seven tons gross tonnage, shall not be obliged
to carry the white light mentioned in subdivision (b) two of this article, but if they do not carry such light they shall have at hand, ready for use, a lantern showing a bright white light, which shall, on the approach of or to other vessels, be exhibited where it can best be seen, in sufficient time to prevent collision; and they shall also show a red pyrotechnic light, as prescribed in subdivision (b) two, or in lieu thereof

a flare-up light. (c) Vessels and boats when line-fishing with their lines out and attached to their
lines, and when not at anchor or stationary, shall carry the same lights as vessels

fishing with drift-nets. (d) Fishing vessels and fishing boats may at any time use a flare-up light in addi-
tion to the lights which they are by this article required to carry and show. All flare-up lights exhibited by a vessel when trawling or fishing with any kind of dragnet shall be shown at the after part of the vessel, excepting that if the vessel is hanging by the stern to her fishing gear, they shall be exhibited from the bow.
(o') Every fishing vessel and every boat when at anchor shall exhibit a white light

visible all around the horizon at a distance of at least one mile. (f) If a vessel or boat when fishing becomes stationary in consequence of her gear

SOUND SIGNALS FOR FOG, AND SO FORTH.

Fog, etc., signals. Post, p. 892.

Art . 15. All signals prescribed by this article for vessels under way shall be given : 1. By "steam-vessels" on the whistle or siren. 2. By "sailing vessels and vessels towed" on the fog-horn. The words "prolonged blast" used iu this article shall mean a blast of from four to six seconds' duration.
A steam-vessel shall be provided with an efficient whistle or siren, sounded by steam or by some substitute for steam, so placed that the sound may not be intercepted by any obstruction, and with au efficient fog-horn, to be sounded by mechanical means, and also with an efficient bell. [In all cases where the rules require a bell to be used a drum may be substituted on board Turkish vessels, or a gong where such articles are used onboard small sea-going vessels.] A sailing vessel of twenty tons gross tonnage or upward shall be provided with a similar fog-horn and bell.
In fog, mist, falling snow, or heavy rain-storms, whether by day or night, the signals described in this article shall be used as follows, viz:
(a) A steam-vessel having way upon her shall sound, at intervals of not more than two minutes, a prolonged blast.
(b) A steam-vessel under way, but stopped, and having no way upon her, shall sound, at intervals of not more than two minutes, two prolonged blasts, with an interval of about one second between them.
(c) A sailing vessel under -way shall sound, at intervals of not more than one minute, when on the starboard tack one blast, when on the port tack two blasts in succession, and when with the wind abaft the beam three blasts in succession
(d) A vessel when at anchor shall, at intervals of not more than one minute, rinothe bell rapidly for about five seconds.
(e) A vessel at anchor at sea, when not in ordinary anchorage ground, and when in such a position as to be an obstruction to vessels under way, shall sound, if a steam-vessel, at intervals of not more than two minutes, two prolonged blasts with her whistle or siren, followed by ringing her bell; or, if a sailing-vessel, at intervals of not more than one minute, two blasts with her fog-horn, followed by ringing her bell.
(f) A vessel when towing shall, instead of the signals prescribed in subdivisions (a) and (c) of this article at intervals of not more than two minutes, sound three blasts iu succession, namely, one prolonged blast followed by two short blasts. A vessel towed may give this signal and she shall not give any other.
(g) A steam-vessel wishing to indicate to another "The way is off my vessel, you may feel your way past me," may sound three blasts in succession, namely, short, long, short, with intervals of about one second between them.
(h) A vessel employed in laying or picking up a telegraph cable shall, on hearing the fog-signal of an approaching vessel, sound in answer three prolonged blasts in succession.
(i) A vessel under wTay, which is unable to get out of the way of an approaching vessel through being not under command, or unable to maneuver as required by these rules, shall, on hearing the fog-signal of au approaching vessel, sound iu answer four short blasts in succession.
Sailing vessels and boats of less than twenty tons gross tonnage shall not be obliged to give the above-mentioned signals, but, if they do not, they shall make some other efficient sound-signal at intervals of not more that one minute.

SPEED OF SHIPS TO BE MODERATE IN FOG, AND SO FORTH.

Speed. Steering and sailing rules.

Art . 16. Every vessel shall, in a fog, mist, falling snow, or heavy rain-storms, go at a moderate speed, having careful regard to the existing circumstances and conditions.
A steam vessel hearing, apparently forward of her beam, the fog-signal of a vessel the position of which is not ascertained shall, so far as the circumstances of the case admit, stop her engines, and then navigate with caution until danger of collision is over.

PRELIMINARY--RISK OF COLLISION.

Risk of collision can, when circumstances permit, be ascertained by carefully watching the compass bearing of an approaching vessel. If the bearing does not appreciably change, such risk should be deemed to exist.
Art . 17. When two sailing vessels are approaching one another, so as to involve risk of collision, one of them shall keep out of the way of the other, as follows, namely:
(a) A vessel which is running free shall keep out of the way of a vessel which is close-hauled.
(b) A vessel which is close-hauled on the port tack shall keep out of the way of a vessel which is close-hauled on the starboard tack.

(d) When both are running free, with the wind on the same side, the vessel which

is to the windward shall keep out of the way of the vessel which is to leeward.

(e) A vessel which has the wind aft shall keep out of the way of the other vessel.

Art . 18. When two steam-vessels are meeting end on, or nearly end on, so as to

involve risk of collision, each shall alter her course to starboard, so that each may

pass on the port side of the other. This article only applies to cases where vessels arc meeting end on, or nearly end
on, in such a manner as to involve risk of collision, and does not apply to two vessels which must, if both keep on their respective courses, pass clear of each other.
The only cases to which it does apply are when each of the two vessels is end on, or nearly end on, to the other; in other words, to cases in which, by day, each vessel s. es the masts of the other in a line, or nearly in a line, with her own; aud by night, to cases in which each vessel is in such a position as to see both the side-lights of the

other. It does not apply by day to cases in which a vessel sees another ahead crossing her
own course; or by night, to cases where the red light of one vessel is opposed to the red light of the other, or where the green light of one vessel is opposed to the green light of the other, or where a red light M'ithout a green light, or a green light without a red light, is seen ahead, or where both green and red lights are seeu anywhere

but ahead. Art . 19. When two steam-vessels are crossing, so as to involve risk of collision, the
vessel which has the other on her own starboard side shall keep out of the way of the other.
Art . 20. When a steam-vessel and a sailing vessel are proceeding in such directions as to involve risk of collision, the steam-vessel shall keep out of the way of the sailing-vessel.
Art . 21. Where by any of these rules one of two vessels is to keep out of the way, the other shall keep her course aud speed.
Art . 22. Every vessel which is directed by these rules to keep out of the way of another vessel shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, avoid crossing ahead

of the other. Art . 23. Every steam-vessel which is directed by these rules to keep out of the way
of another vessel shall, on approaching her, if necessary, slacken her speed or stop

or reverse. Art . 24. Notwithstanding anything contained in these rules every vessel, over-
taking any other, shall keep out of the way of the overtaken vessel. Every vessel coming up with another vessel from any direction more than two
points abaft her beam, that is, in such a position, with reference to the vessel which she is overtaking that at night she would be unable to see either of that vessel's s de-lights, shall be deemed to be an overtaking vessel; and no subsequent alteration of the bearing between the two vessels shall make the overtaking vessel a crossing vessel within the meaning of these rules, or relieve her of the duty of keeping clear

of the overtaken vessel until she is finally past and clear. As by day the overtaking vessel can not always know with certainty whether shei
is forward of or abaft this direction from the other vessel she should, if in doubt, assume that she is an overtaking vessel and keep out of the way.
Art . 25. In narrow channels every steam-vessel shall, when it is safe and practicable, keep to that side of the fair-way or mid-channel which lies on the starboard

side of such vessel. Art . 26. Sailing vessels under way shall keep out of the way of sailing vessels or
boats fishing with nets, or lines, or trawls. This rule shall not give to any vessel or boat engaged in fishing the right of obstructing a fair-way used by vessels other

than fishing vessels or boats. Art . 27. In obeying and construing these rules due regard shall be had to all
dangers of navigation and collision, and to any special circumstances which may rentier a departure from the above rules necessary iu order to avoid immediate

danger.

SOUND-SIGNALS FOR VESSELS IN SIGHT OF ONE ANOTHER.

Sound signals.

Art . 28. The words "short blast" used in this article shall mean a blast of aboui one second's duration.
When vessels are in sight of one another, a steam-vessel under way, in taking any course authorized or required by these rules, shall indicate that course by the following signals on her whistle or siren, namely:
One short blast to mean, "I am directing my course to starboard." Two short blasts to mean, "I am directing my course to port." Three short blasts to mean, "My engines are going at full speed astern."

NO VESSEL, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, TO NEGLECT PROPER PRECAUTIONS.
Art . 29. Nothing in these rules shall exonerate any vessel or the owner or master oi crew thereof, from the consequences of any neglect to carry lights or signals, or olf any neglect to keep a proper look-out, or of the neglect of any precaution whicbi may be required by the ordinary practice of seamen, or by the special circumstances of the case.

regards the discharge of civil and political rights, admission to the

public service, functions, and honors, and the exercise of the different

professions and industries.

"All persons shall be admitted, without distinction of religion, to

give evidence before the tribunals,

" Liberty and the outward exercise of all forms of worshij) are assured

to all, and no hindrance shall be offered either to the hierarchical

organization of the various communions or to their relations with their

spiritual chiefs.

agents of the Powers in Turkey is recognized both as regards the above-

mentioned persons and their religious, charitable, and other establish-

ments in the holy places;" and

Whereas the intent and object of the above cited provisions of said

treaty are to place the Christian subjects of the Porte under the pro-

tection of the other signatories thereto, and to secure to such Christian

subjects full liberty of religious worship and belief, the equal benefit of

the laws, and all the privileges and immunities belonging to any sub-

jects of the Turkish Empire; and

Whereas by said treaty the Christian Powers, parties thereto, having

established, under the consent of Turkey, their right to accomplish and

secure the above-recited objects; and

Whereas the American people, in common with all Christian people

everywhere, have beheld with horror the recent appalling outrages and

massacres of which the Christian population of Turkey have been made

of the Turkish Empire all the rights belonging to them both as men

and Christians and as beneficiaries of the explicit provisions of the treaty above recited.

Convention for the exchange of money orders between the United States of America and the Republic of Honduras.

June 25,1896. July 16,1896.

Artic le I. There shall be a regular exchange of money orders between the United States of America and the Republic of Honduras.
Art . II. The amounts of orders in both directions shall be expressed in United States money, and, on account of the frequent fluctuations of the rate of exchange between the two countries, it is agreed that all amounts shall be converted into their proper equivalents, by the postoffice department of Honduras; that is to say, the sums received by the post-office department of Honduras for orders drawn on the United States shall be converted, at the time of issue, into United States money, at the current rate of exchange, and the amounts of orders drawn in the United States on Honduras, shall, in like manner, be rendered by the post-office department of Honduras into the currency of Honduras, at the current rate of exchange on the day of the arrival on the exchange list.
Art . III. The maximum amount for which a money order may be drawn in either country upon the other shall be $100.
Art . IV. No money order shall contain a fractional part of a cent. Art . V. The amounts of money orders shall be deposited by the remitters and paid to the payee in gold coin, or in any other legal money of the same current value. However, in case there should be in circulation in either country a paper money of legal tender, but of less value than gold, the administration of that country shall have the right to receive and employ the same in its relations with the public, taking into account the difference in value. Art . VI. The Post-Office Department of Honduras and the PostOffice Department of the United States shall each have the power to fix, from time to time, the rates of commission to be charged on all money orders they may respectively issue. This commission shall belong to tbe issuing postal administration, but the post-office department of Honduras shall pay to the Post-Office Department of the United States one-half of 1 per cent on the amount of money orders issued in Honduras and payable in the United States, aud the PostOffice Department of the United States shall make a like payment to the post-office department of Honduras for money orders issued in the United States and payable in Honduras. Art . VII. No money order shall be issued unless the applicant furnish, in full, the surname, and at least the initial of one given name, both of the remitter and the payee, or the name of the firm or company who are the remitters or payees, together with the address of the remitter and that of payee. If, however, any applicant for a money order shall tender the name of either the remitter or payee at greater length, such particulars shall be received and entered in the list. Art . VIII. The service of the postal money-order system between the two countries shall be performed exclusively by the agency of the offices of exchange. On the part of Honduras, the office of exchange shall be Tegucigalpa, and on the part of the United States, New York, N. Y.
Art . IX. The particulars of all money orders drawn in the United States upon Honduras shall be entered at the exchange office, New York, in a list similar to the form marked A (in the Appendix) in which

shall be shown the amount of each order in United States money, which list, after having received the impression of the New York date stamp, shall be forwarded to the exchange post office of Honduras, where it shall be impressed with the date stamp of that office, and where the requisite arrangements for effecting payment of the order shall be carried out.
In like manner, the particulars of money orders drawn in Honduras upon the United States shall be entered at the exchange office at Tegucigalpa in a list similar to the form marked B in which shall be shown the amount of each order in the money of both countries, which list, after having received the impression of the date stamp of that office, shall be forwarded to the exchange office of New York, where it shall receive the impression of the date stamp in use at that office and where the necessary arrangements for effecting payments of the orders shall be carried out.
Each list, as well as the entries in the list dispatched, shall be numbered consecutively 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc., in the order of dispatch, commencing on July 1 of each calendar year, and the receipt of each list shall be acknowledged, ou either side, by means of the first subsequent list forwarded in the opposite direction.
Such a list shalll be transmitted by each mail dispatched from Honduras to the port of New York, and vice versa, and in order to prevent inconvenience, in case the original lists shall be lost, each officer shall forward by the following mail a duplicate of the list sent by the preceding mail.
Should it happen that on the day when the list is to be dispatched there are no orders to be communicated for payment, the list must nevertheless be sent. But in that event the exchange office will write across the list the words "No money orders."
The orders issued in the United States during the second quarter, or the quarter ending June 30 of each year, which may arrive at the office of exchange at New York in the following quarter shall be entered on lists supplementary to the last list of the month of June and, in like manner, the orders issued in Honduras during the second quarter, or quarter ending June 30 of each year, which may arrive at the exchange office at Tegucigalpa in the following quarter, shall be entrred on lists supplementary to the last list of the month of June.
Art . 10. As soon as the list of the dispatching office shall have reached the receiving office of exchange, the latter shall make out internal money orders in favor of the payees for the amounts specified in the list, and shall forward them, free of postage, to the addresses, or to the offices of destination, in conformity with the regulations in each country for the payment of money orders. When the lists shall show irregularities which the receiving office shall not be able to rectify, that office shall demand an explanation with as little delay as possible. Pending tbe receipt of the explanation, the issue of internal money orders of payment relating to the entries found to be erroneous in the list should be suspended.
One copy of each exchange list shall be returned by the receiving exchange office to the dispatching office, but, before returning such copy, the receiving exchange office shall enter therein the names of the respective offices of payment of the orders enumerated in the list, and, in the lists from the United States returned by the exchange office of Tegucigalpa, the latter office shall also enter the amount of each order, in the money of Honduras, according to the conversion made by it.
Art . XI. The orders issued by each country on the other shall be subject, as regards payment, to the regulations which govern the payment of domestic orders in the country of destination. It is agreed that all money orders paid in either country shall be retained in the country in which they are paid.
Art . XII. When it is desired that any error in the name of the payee or remitter shall be corrected, or that the amount of a money

CONVENTION--HONDURAS. July 16, 1896.

1609

order shall be repaid to the remitter, application must be made by the remitter to the postal administration of the country in which the order was issued.
Duplicate orders shall only be issued by the postal administration of the country on which the original orders were drawn, and in conformity with the regulations established in that country.
Art . XIII. Repayment, whether of an original or by means of a duplicate order, shall not be made to the remitter until it has been ascertained through the postal administration of the country on which the original order was drawn that the order has not been paid, and will not be paid in the country of payment.
Art . XIV. Orders which shall not have been paid within twelve calendar months from the month of issue shall become void aud the sums received shall accrue to, and be at the disposal of, the country of origin.
The Post-Office Department of Honduras shall therefore enter to the credit of the United States, in the quarterly account, all money orders entered in the lists received from the United States, and which remain unpaid at the end of the period specified.
On the other hand, the Post-Office Department of the United States shall, at the close of each month, transmit to the Post-Office Department of Honduras, for entry in the quarterly account, a detailed statement of all orders included in the lists dispatched from the latter office, which under this article become void.

But it is hereby agreed that either of the two post-office departments shall be empowered to pay such balances due to the other by means of sight bills of exchange drawn on London, in sterling money, on the basis that $4.78 ot the money of the United States shall be equivalent to 1 sterling.

Art . XVI. The Postmaster-General, in either country, shall be authorized to adopt any additional rules, if not repugnant to the foregoing, for the greater security against fraud, or for the better working of the system generally. All such additional rules, however, must be communicated to the Postmaster General of the other country.
Art . XVII. Each administration is authorized, in extraordinary circumstances that would justify the measure, to suspend temporarily the money order service, in whole or in part, upon condition of giving notice of such suspension immediately to the other country, and, if deemed necessary, by means of the telegraph.
Art . XVIII. This convention shall come into operation on the 1st day of October, 1896, and shall continue in force until twelve months
