Sec . 3.

Art ic le XIII. No part of the annuities of the Yanctons shall be taken to pay any debts, claims, or demands against them, except such existing claims and demands as have been herein provided for, and except such as may arise under this agreement, or under the trade and intercourse laws of the United States.
Art ic le XIV. The said Yanctons do hereby fully acquit and release the United States from all demands against them on the part of said tribe, or any individual thereof, except the before mentioned right of the Yanctons to receive an annuity under said treaty of Laramie, and except, also, such as are herein stipulated and provided for.
Art ic le XV. For the special benefit of the Yanctons, parties to this agreement, the United States agree to appoint an agent for them, who shall reside on their said reservation, and shall have set apart for his sole use and occupation, at such a point as the Secretary of the Interior may direct, one hundred and sixty acres of land.
Art ic le XVI. All the expenses of the making of this agreement and of surveying the said Yancton reservation, and of surveying and marking said Pipe-stone quarry, shall be paid by the United States.

TREATY OF FORT LARAMIE.
This treaty was concluded September 17, 1851. When it was before the S'enate for ratification, certain amendments were made which require the assent of the Tribes, parties to it, before it can be considered a complete instrument. This assent of all the Tribes has not been obtained, and, consequently, although Congress appropriates money for the fulfilment of its stipulations, it is not yet in a proper form for publication. This note is added for the purpose of making the references from the Public Laws complete, and as an explanation why the Treaty is not published.

No. 49. Respecting discriminating Duties of Tonnage and Impost upon Vessels and Cargoes of the Subjects of His Holiness, the Pope.

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: Feb. 25, 1858.

A PROCLAMATION.

Whe re as , by an act of Congress of the United States, of the twenty-fourth of May, one thousand eight hundred and twenty-eight, entitled " An act in addition to an act entitled ` An act concerning discriminating duties of tonnage and impost,' and to equalize the duties on Prussian vessels and their cargoes," it is provided, that upon satisfactory evidence being given to the President of the United States, by the government of any foreign nation, that no discriminating duties of tonnage or impost are imposed or levied in the ports of the said nation upon vessels wholly belonging to citizens of the United States, or upon the produce, manufactures, or merchandise imported in the same from the United States, or from any foreign country, the President is thereby authorized to issue his proclamation declaring that the foreign discriminating duties of tonnage and impost within the United States are, and shall be, suspended and discontinued, so far as respects the vessels of the said foreign nation, and the produce, manufactures, or merchandise imported into the United States in the same from the

said- foreign nation, or from any other foreign country; the said suspension to take effect from the time of such notification being given to the President of the United States, and to continue so long as the reciprocal exemption of vessels belonging to citizens of the United States, and their cargoes, as aforesaid, shall be continued, and no longer:
And whereas satisfactory evidence has lately been received from the government of his Holiness the Pope, through an official communication addressed by Cardinal Antonelli, his secretary of state, to the minister resident of the United States at Rome, under date of the seventh day of December, one thousand eight hundred and fifty-seven, that no discriminating duties of tonnage or impost are imposed or levied in the ports of the Pontifical States upon vessels wholly belonging to citizens of the United States, or upon the produce, manufactures,, or merchandise imported in the same from the United States, or from any foreign country:
Now, therefore, I, JAMES BUCHANAN, President of the United States of America, do hereby declare and proclaim that the foreign discriminating duties of tonnage and impost within the United States are, and shall be, suspended and discontinued, so far as respects the vessels of the subjects of His Holiness the Pope, and the produce, manufactures, or merchandise imported into the United States in the same from the Pontifical States, or from any other foreign country; the said suspension to take effect from the seventh day of December, one thousand eight hundred and fifty-seven, above mentioned, and to continue so long as the reciprocal exemption of vessels belonging to citizens of the United States and their cargoes as aforesaid shall be continued, and no longer.

No. 50. Respecting the Rebellion and Mormon Troubles in the Territory of Utah.
April 6, 1858. BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
A PROCLAMATION.
Whe re as , the Territory of Utah was settled by certain emigrants from the States, and from foreign countries, who have for several years past manifested a spirit of insubordination to the constitution and laws of the United States; The great mass of those settlers, acting under the influence of leaders to whom they seem to have surrendered their judgment, refuse to be controlled by any other authority. They have been often advised to obedience, and these friendly counsels have been answered with defiance. The officers of the federal government have been driven from the Territory for no offence but an effort to do their sworn duty. Others have been prevented from going there by threats of assassination. Judges have been violently interrupted in the performance of their functions, and the records of the courts have been seized and either destroyed or concealed. Many other acts of unlawful violence have been perpetrated, and the right to repeat them has been openly claimed by the leading inhabitants, with at least the silent acquiescence of nearly all the others. Their hostility to the lawful government of the country has at length become so violent that no officer bearing a commission from the Chief Magistrate of the Union can enter the Territory or remain there with safety; and all the officers recently appointed have been unable to go to Salt Lake or anywhere else in Utah beyond the immediate power of the army. Indeed, such is believed to be the condition to which a strange system of terrorism has brought the inhabitants of that region, that no one among them could express an opinion favorable to this government, or even propose to obey its laws, without exposing his life and property to peril.
After carefully considering this state of affairs, and maturely weighing the. obligation I was under to see the laws faithfully executed it seemed to me right

power, in the execution of the laws; commanding all citizens of the United States in said Territory to aid and assist the officers in the performance of their duties ; offering to the inhabitants of Utah, who shall submit to the laws, a free pardon for the seditions and treasons heretofore by them committed; warning those who shall persist, after notice of this proclamation, in the present rebellion against the United States, that they must expect no further lenity, but look to be rigorously dealt with according to their deserts ; and declaring that the militaryforces now in Utah, and hereafter to be sent there, will not be withdrawn until the inhabitants of that Territory shall manifest a proper sense of the duty which they owe to this government.
In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed to these presents.

No. 52. Respecting an apprehended Invasion of Nicaragua. October 30,1858. BY JAMES BUCHANAN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA:
A PROCLAMATION.
Whe re as information has reached me from sources which I cannot disregard that certain persons, in violation of the neutrality laws of the United States, are making a third attempt to set on foot a military expedition within their territory against Nicaragua, a foreign State, with which they are at peace. In order to raise money for equipping and maintaining this expedition, persons connected therewith, as I have reason to believe, have issued and sold bonds and other contracts pledging the public lands of Nicaragua and the transit route through its territory as a security for their redemption and fulfilment.
The hostile design of this expedition is rendered manifest by the fact that these bonds and contracts can be of no possible value to their holders, unless the pres-

No. 52. Respecting an apprehended Invasion of Nicaragua. October 30,1858. BY JAMES BUCHANAN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA:
A PROCLAMATION.
Whe re as information has reached me from sources which I cannot disregard that certain persons, in violation of the neutrality laws of the United States, are making a third attempt to set on foot a military expedition within their territory against Nicaragua, a foreign State, with which they are at peace. In order to raise money for equipping and maintaining this expedition, persons connected therewith, as I have reason to believe, have issued and sold bonds and other contracts pledging the public lands of Nicaragua and the transit route through its territory as a security for their redemption and fulfilment.
The hostile design of this expedition is rendered manifest by the fact that these bonds and contracts can be of no possible value to their holders, unless the pres-

APPENDIX. PROCLAMATIONS. Nos. 52, 53.

ent government of Nicaragua shall be overthrown by force. Besides, the envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of that government in the United States has issued a notice, in pursuance of his instructions, dated on the 27th instant, forbidding the citizens or subjects of any nation, except passengers intending to proceed through Nicaragua over the Transit Route from ocean to ocean, to enter its territory without a regular passport, signed by the proper minister or consul-general of the republic resident in the country from whence they shall have departed. Such persons, with this exception, " will be stopped and compelled to return by the same conveyance that took them to the country." From these circumstances, the inference is irresistible that persons engaged in this expedition will leave the United States with hostile purposes against Nicaragua. They cannot, under the guise which they have assumed, that they are peaceful emigrants, conceal their real intentions, and especially when they know, in advance, that their landing will be resisted, and can only be accomplished by an overpowering force. This expedient was successfully resorted to previous to the last expedition, and the vessel in which those composing it were conveyed to Nicaragua, obtained a clearance from the collector of the port of Mobile. Although, after a careful examination, no arms or munitions of war were discovered on board, yet, when they arrived in Nicaragua, they were form'd to be armed and equipped and immediately commenced hostilities.
The leaders of former illegal expeditions of the same character have openly expressed their intention to renew hostilities against Nicaragua. One of them, who has already been twice expelled from Nicaragua, has invited, through the public newspapers, American citizens to emigrate to that republic, and has designated Mobile as the place of rendezvous and departure, and San Juan del Norte as the port to which they are bound. This person, who has renounced his allegiance to the United States, and claims to be President of Nicaragua, has given notice to the collector of the port of Mobile that two or three hundred of these emigrants will be prepared to embark from that port about the middle of November.
For these and other good reasons, and for the purpose of saving American citizens who may have been honestly deluded into the belief that they are about to proceed to Nicaragua as peaceful emigrants, if any such there be, from the disastrous consequences to which they will be exposed, I, JAMES BUCHANAN, President of the United States, have thought it fit to issue this my proclamation enjoining upon all officers of the government, civil and military, in their respective spheres, to be vigilant, active, and faithful in suppressing these illegal enterprises, and in carrying out their standing instructions to that effect; exhorting all good citizens, by their respect for the laws and their regard for the peace and welfare of the country, to aid the efforts of the public authorities in the discharge of their duties.
In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed to these presents.

and proper that I should make such use of the military force at my disposal as might be necessary to protect the federal officers in going into the Territory of Utah, and in performing their duties after arriving there. I accordingly ordered a detachment of the army to march for the City of Salt Lake, or within reach of that place, and to act in case of need as a posse for the enforcement of the laws. But, in the mean time, the hatred of that misguided people for the just and legal authority of the government had become so intense that they resolved to measure their military strength with that of the Union. They have organized an armed force far from contemptible in point of numbers, and trained it, if not with skill, at least with great assiduity and perseverance. While the troops of the United States were on their march, a train of baggagewagons, which happened to be unprotected, was attacked and destroyed by a portion of the Mormon forces, and the provisions and stores with which the train was laden were wantonly burnt. In short, their present attitude is one of decided and unreserved enmity to the United States and to all their loyal citizens. Their determination to oppose the authority of the government by military force has not only been expressed in words, but manifested in overt acts of the most unequivocal character.
Fellow-citizens of Utah this is rebellion against the government to which you owe allegiance. It is levying war against the United States, and involves you in the guilt of treason. Persistence in it will bring you to condign punishment, to ruin, and to shame ; for it is mere madness to suppose that, with your limited resources, you can successfully resist the force of this great and powerful nation.
If you have calculated upon the forbearance of the United States--if you have permitted yourselves to suppose that this government will fail to put forth its strength and bring you to submission--you have fallen into a grave mistake. You have settled upon territory which lies geographically in the heart of the Union. The land you live upon was purchased by the United States and paid for out of their treasury ; the proprietary right and title to it is in them, and not in you. Utah is bounded on every side by States and Territories whose people are true to the Union. It is absurd to believe that they will or can permit you to erect in their very midst a government of your own, not only independent of the authority which they all acknowledge, but hostile to them and their interests.
Do not deceive yourselves nor try to mislead others by propagating the idea that this is a crusade against your religion. The constitution and laws of this country can take no notice of your creed, whether it be true or false. That is a question between your God and yourselves, in which I disclaim all right to interfere. If you obey the laws, keep the peace, and respect the just rights of others, you will be perfectly secure, and may live on in your present faith or change it for another at your pleasure. Every intelligent man among you knows very well that this government has never, directly or indirectly, sought to molest you in your worship, to control you in your ecclesiastical affairs, or even to influence you in your religious opinions.
This rebellion is not merely a violation of your legal duty; it is without just cause, without reason, without excuse. You never made a complaint that was not listened to with patience. You never exhibited a real grievance that was not redressed as promptly as it could be. The laws and regulations enacted for your government by Congress have been equal and just, and their enforcement was manifestly necessary for your own welfare and happiness. You have never asked their repeal. They are similar in every material respect to the laws which have been passed for the other Territories of the Union, and which everywhere else (with one partial exception) have been cheerfully obeyed. No people ever lived who were freer from unnecessary legal restraints than you. Human wisdom never devised a political system which bestowed more blessings or imposed lighter burdens than the government of the United States in its operation upon the Territories.
But being anxious to save the effusion of blood, and to avoid the indiscriminate punishment of a whole people for crimes of which it is not probable that all are equally guilty, I offer now a free and full pardon to all who will submit themselves to the authority of the federal government. If you refuse to accept it, let the consequences fall upon your own heads. But I conjure you to pause deliberately and reflect well before you reject this tender of peace and
good-will. Now, therefore, I, JAMES BUCHANAN, President of the United States, have

No. 52. Respecting an apprehended Invasion of Nicaragua. October 30,1858. BY JAMES BUCHANAN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA:
A PROCLAMATION.
Whe re as information has reached me from sources which I cannot disregard that certain persons, in violation of the neutrality laws of the United States, are making a third attempt to set on foot a military expedition within their territory against Nicaragua, a foreign State, with which they are at peace. In order to raise money for equipping and maintaining this expedition, persons connected therewith, as I have reason to believe, have issued and sold bonds and other contracts pledging the public lands of Nicaragua and the transit route through its territory as a security for their redemption and fulfilment.
The hostile design of this expedition is rendered manifest by the fact that these bonds and contracts can be of no possible value to their holders, unless the pres-

RULE V.

Restrictions relaxed. on

Regarding certain Commodities heretofore Contraband. The restrictions affecting trade in opium, cash, grain, pulse, sulphur,

brimstone, saltpetre, and spelter, are relaxed under the following condi-

tions :

Onium,

1. Opium will henceforth pay thirty taels per pecul import duty. The

importer will sell it only at the port. It will be carried into the interior

by Chinese only, and only as Chinese property; the foreign trader will

not be allowed to accompany it. The provision of the treaty of Tient-

sin, conferring privileges by virtue of the most favored clause, so far as

respects citizens of the United States going into the interior to trade or

paying transit duties, shall not extend to the article of opium, the transit

duties on which will be arranged as the Chinese Government see fit; nor

in future revisions of the tariff is the same rule of revision to be applied

to opium as to other goods.

Copper cash, 2. Copper cash. -- The export of cash to any foreign port is prohibit-

ed ; but it shall be lawful for citizens of the United States to ship it at

one of the open ports of China to another on compliance with the follow-

ing regulation: The shipper shall give notice of the amount of cash he

desires to ship, and the port of its destination, and shall bind himself,

either by a bond with two sufficient sureties, or by depositing such other

security as may be deemed by the customs satisfactory, to return, within

six months from the date of clearance, to the collector at the port of ship-

ment, the certificate issued by him, with an acknowledgment thereon of

the receipt of cash at the port of destination by the collector at that port,

who shall thereto affix his seal; or, failing the production of the certifi-

cate, to forfeit a sum equal in value to the cash shipped.

Cash will pay no duty inwards or outwards but a freight, or part-

freight of cash, though no other cargo be on board, will render the vessel

carrying it liable to tonnage dues.

Rice and other 3. The export of rice and all other grains whatsoever, native or for-

grains,

eign, no matter where grown or whence imported, to any foreign port, is

prohibited; but these commodities may be carried by citizens of the

United States from one of the open ports of China to another, under the

same conditions in respect to security as cash, on payment at the port of

shipment of the duty specified in the tariff.

No import duty shall be levyable upon rice or grain, but a freight or

part freight of rice or grain, though no other cargo be on board, will ren-

der the vessel importing it liable to tonnage dues.

Pulse and bean cake,

4. Pulse. -- The export of pulse and bean cake from Tang-Chau and Nin-Chwang under the American flag is prohibited. From any of the

other open ports they may be shipped, on payment of the tariff duty,

either to other ports of China or to foreign countries.

Saltpetre, sul- 5. Saltpetre, sulphur, brimstone, and spelter, being deemed by the

nhur. &c.

Chinese to be munitions of war, shall not be imported by citizens of the

United States save at the requisition of the Chinese government, or for

sale to Chinese duly authorized to purchase them. No permit to land

them shall be issued until the customs have proof that the necessary au-

thority has been given to the purchaser. It shall not be lawful for citi-

zens of the United States to carry these commodities up the Yang-tsz-

Kiang, or into any port other than those open on the sea-board, nor to

accompany them into the interior on behalf of Chinese. They must be

sold at the ports only, and, except at the ports, they will be regarded as

Chinese property.

1079

RULE vi.

Liability of Vessels Entering Port.

For the prevention of misunderstanding, it is agreed that American vessels must be reported to the Consul within twenty-four hours, counting from the time the vessel comes within the limits of the port, and that the same rule be applied to the forty-eight hours allowed by article 19 of the treaty to remain in port without payment of tonnage dues.
The limits of the ports shall be defined by the customs, with all consideration for the convenience of trade, compatible with due protection of the revenue; also, the limits of the anchorages within which lading and discharging are permitted by the customs, and the same shall be notified
to the Consuls for oublic information.

Liabilities of vessels entering port.
Limits of ports.

RULE VII.

Transit Dues.

It is agreed that the amount of transit dues legally levyable upon merchandise imported or exported shall be one half the tariff duties, except in the case of the duty free goods liable to a transit duty of two and a half per cent, ad valorem, as provided in No. 2 of these Rules.
Merchandise shall be cleared of its transit dues under the following
regulations: In the case of imports. Notice being given at the port of entry from
which the imports are to be forwarded inland of the nature and quantity of the goods, the ship from which they have been landed, and the place inland to which they are bound, with all other necessary particulars, the collector of customs shall, on due inspection made, and on receipt of the transit duty due, issue a transit duty certificate. This must be produced at every barrier station, and visaed. No further duty will be levyable upon imports so certificated, no matter how distant the place of their destination.
In the case of exports. Produce purchased by a citizen of the United States in the interior will be inspected and taken account of at the first barrier it passes on its way to the port of shipment. A memorandum, showing the amount of the produce, and the port at which it is to be shipped, will be deposited there by the person in charge of the produce. He will then receive a certificate, which must be exhibited and viseed at every barrier on his way to the port of shipment. On the arrival of the produce at the barrier nearest the port notice must be given to the customs at the port, and the transit dues due thereon being paid it will be passed. On exportation the produce will pay the tariff duty.
Any attempt to pass goods inwards or outwards, otherwise than in compliance with the rule here laid down, will render them liable to confiscation. Unauthorized sale in transitu of goods that have been entered as above for a port will render them liable to confiscation. Any attempt to pass goods in excess of the quantity specified in the certificate will
render all the goods of the same denomination named in the certificate liable to confiscation. Permission to export produce which cannot be proved to have paid its transit dues will be refused by the customs until
the transit dues shall have been paid.

Transit dues. Amount. Imports. Exports. Penalty for violation of these rules.

For this most desirable object, the President of the United States of America has conferred full powers on John W. Dana, a citizen of the said States, and their Minister Resident to the said Republic ; and the President of the Republic of Bolivia on the citizen Lucas Mendosa de la Tapia, Secretary of State in the Department of Exterior Relations and Public Instruction, who, after having exchanged their said full powers in due and proper form, have agreed to the following articles :

Kights of most favored nation.

Explanations.

EXPLANATION.
As in said article it is stipulated that any special favor in navigation and trade granted by one of the contracting parties to any other nation, extends and is common to the other party forthwith, it is declared that, in what pertains to the navigation of rivers, this treaty shall only apply to concessions which the Government may authorize for navigating fluvial streams which do not present obstructions ; that is to say, those whose navigation may be naturally plain and current without there having been need to obtain it by the employment of labor and capital; that by consequence there remains reserved the right of the Bolivian Government to grant privileges to any association or company, as well foreign as national, which should undertake the navigation of those rivers from which, in order to succeed, there are difficulties to overcome, such as the clearing out of rapids, &c., &c.

ESPLICACION.
Como en dicho articulo se estipula que cualquier favor particular en navegacion i comercio concedido por una de las partes contratantes a cualquiera otra nacion, se estienda i haga comun A la otra parte inmediatamente -- se declara que, en lo tocante a la navegacion de los rios, esta convencion solo serfi aplicable a las concesiones que el' Gobierno de Bolivia otorgare para navegar los cursos fluviales que no presentasen obstaculos, es decir, de aquellos cuya navegacion estuviese naturalmente allanada i corriente sift, que hubiera sido preciso procurarla empleando trabajo i capitales ; que por consiguiente queda a salvo el derecho del Gobierno de Bolivia para conceder privilejios a cualquiera Sociedad 6 Compania tanto estranjera #)mo naciOnal que emprendiese la navegacion en aquellos rios donde para conseguirla hai que superar dificultades, tales como el allanamiento de cachuelas, &c.

between tbeir respective territories and citizens. The citizens of either republic may frequent with their vessels all the coasts, ports, and places of the other, where foreign commerce is permitted, and reside in all parts of the territory of either, and occupy dwellings and warehouses ; and everything belonging thereto shall be respected, and shall not be subjected to any arbitrary visits or search. The said citizens shall have full liberty to trade in all parts of the territory of either, according to the rules established by the respective regulations of commerce, in all kinds of goods, merchandise, manufactures, and produce, not prohibited to all, and to open retail stores and shops, under the same municipal and police regulations as native citizens ; and they shall not in this respect be liable to any other or higher taxes on imposts than those which are or may be paid by native citizens. No examination or inspection of their
books, papers, or accounts, shall be made without the legal order of a competent tribunal or judge.
The provisions of this treaty are not to be understood as applying to the navigation and coasting trade between one port and another, situated in the territory of either of the contracting parties -- the regulation of such navigation and trade being reserved respectively by the parties according to their own separate laws. Vessels of either country shall, however, be permitted to discharge part of their cargoes at one port, open to foreign commerce, in the territories of either of the high contracting parties, paying only the custom-house duties upon that portion of the cargo which may be discharged, and to proceed with the remainder of their cargo to any other port or ports of the same territory, open to foreign commerce, without paying other or higher tonnage duties or port charges in such cases than would be paid by national vessels in like circumstances; and they shall be permitted to load in like manner at different ports in the same voyage outwards.

that the owners may dispose of them as they see proper. No vessel of either of the two nations shall be detained on the high seas on account of having on board articles of contraband, whenever the master, captain, or supercargo of said vessel will deliver up the articles of contraband to the captor, unless the quantity of such articles be so great, or of so large a bulk that they cannot be received on board the capturing ship without great inconvenience ; but in this, as well as in all other cases of just detention, the vessel detained shall be sent to the nearest convenient and safe port for trial and judgment according to law.

Los articulos de contrabando ya

And whereas it frequently happens that vessels sail for a port or places belonging to an enemy without knowing that the same is besieged, blockaded, or invested, it is agreed that every vessel so circumstanced may be turned away from
such port or place, but shall not be detained ; nor shall any part of her cargo, if not contraband, be confiscated, unless, after warning of such blockade or investment from any officer commanding a vessel of the blockading forces, they shall again attempt to enter; but she shall be permitted to go to any other port or place she shall think proper. Nor
shall any vessel of either that may have entered into such port before the same was actually besieged, blockaded, or invested by the other, be restrained from quitting such place with her cargo ; nor, if found therein after the reduction and surrender, shall such vessel or her cargo be liable to confiscation, but they shall be restored to the owners thereof.
