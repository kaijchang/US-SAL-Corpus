The next officer in rank shall be promoted to the place of the retired officer, according to the established rules of the service. And the same rule of promotion shall be applied successively to the vacancies consequent upon the retirement of an officer. Sec . 23. And be it further enacted, That whenever any officer of the navy, on being ordered to perform the duties appropriate to his commission, shall report himself unable to comply with such order, or whenever, in the judgment of the President of the United States, an officer of the navy shall be in any way incapacitated from performing the duties of his >ffice, the President, at his discretion, shall direct the Secretary of the Navy to refer the case of such officer to a board of not more than nine, and not less than five, commissioned officers, two-fifths of whom shall be members of the medical bureau of the navy ; the board, except those taken from the medical bureau, to be composed, if possible, (as far as may be,) of his seniors in rank. The determination of the board in each case shall, with a record of its proceedings, be transmitted to the Secretary of the Navy, to be laid before the President for his approval or disapproval, and orders in the case. The board, whenever it finds an officer incapacitated for active service, will report whether, in its judgment, the incapacity result from long and faithful service, from wounds or injury received in the line of duty, from sickness or exposure therein, or from any other incident of service ; if so, and the President approve of such judgment, the disabled officer shall thereupon be placed upon the list of retired officers, according to the provisions of this act. But if such disability or incompetency proceeded from other causes, and the President concur in opinion with the board, the officer may be retired upon furlough pay, or he shall be wholly retired from the service, with one year's pay, at the discretion of the President; and in this last case his name shall be wholly omitted from the navy register. The members of the board shall, in every case, be sworn to an honest and impartial discharge of their duties, and no officer of the navy shall be retired, either partially or wholly, from, the service without having had a fair and full hearing before the board, if he shall demand it. Sec . 24. And be it further enacted, That the retired officers shall be entitled to wear the uniform of their respective grades, shall continue to be borne upon the navy register, shall be subject to the rules and articles governing the navy, and to trial by general court-martial. Sec . 25. And be it further enacted, That retired officers of the army, navy, and marine corps may be assigned to such duties as the President may deem them capable of performing, and such as the exigencies of the public service may require.

Preamble.

Special Treaty concerning the Abolition of the Stade or Brunshausen Dues.

The United States of America and his Majesty the King of Hanover, equally animated by the desire to increase and facilitate the relations of commerce and navigation between the two countries, have resolved to conclude a special treaty, to the end to free the navigation of the Elbe from the tolls known under the designation of the Stade or Brunshausen dues, and have for that purpose conferred full powers: the President of the United States of America upon Mr. Norman B.

Art ic le I. His Majesty the King of Hanover assumes towards the United States of America, who accept the same, the obligation --
1. To abolish completely and forever the toll hitherto levied on the cargoes of American vessels ascending the Elbe, and passing the mouth of the river called Schwinge, designated under the name of the Stade or Brunshausen dues ;
2. To levy no toll of any kind, of whatever nature it may be, upon the hulls or cargoes of American vessels ascending or descending the Elbe, in place of those dues, the abolition of which is agreed upon in the preceding paragraph ;
3. Nor to subject hereafter, under any pretext whatever, American vessels ascending or descending the Elbe to any measure of control regarding the dues that are hereby abolished.
Art ic le II. His Majesty the King of Hanover obligates himself moreover to the United States of America --
1. To provide as hitherto, and to the extent of the existing obligations, for the maintenance of the works that are necessary to the free navigation of the Elbe;

THOS. S. GLADDING, Secretary L. P. § W. R. R. Co.

Whereas, by the treaty of Sarcoxieville, amended by the United States

Senate, and finally ratified by the President of the United States on the

22d day of August, 1860, a principal object of both parties was the con-

struction of a certain contemplated railroad therein named; and to that

end the Leavenworth, Pawnee, and Western Railroad Company were to

pay into the United States Treasury, in gold or silver coin, a sum of

money, afterwards ascertained to be $286,742^^, as the appraised value

of certain lands in Kansas belonging to the Delaware tribe of Indians;

which sum of money, after expending a sufficient part of it to enable the

Indians to commence agricultural pursuits under favorable circumstances,

was to be, by the President for said Indians, invested in safe and profit-

able stocks : And whereas the said railroad company is not able to pay

said sum of money within time, according to said treaty; and whereas

the President is of opinion that it is not for the interest of either party

that said object of the treaty shall fail, but not knowing what would be

the desire of said Indians on this point, nor knowing whether any part

of said sum would be needed to enable the Indians to commence agricul-

tural pursuits under favorable circumstances, but supposing it probable

that no part of it would be so needed, as said Indians now have over fifty

thousand dollars lying idle in the United States Treasury: Therefore --

It is directed by the President that said Railroad Company may exe-

cute their bonds, with interest-warrants or coupons attached, according to

the forms hereto annexed, the principal of which bonds shall amount to

the aggregate sum of $286,742^^, and deposit the same with Archibald

Williams, of Kansas, hereby appointed to receive and receipt for the

same, to be by him transmitted to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs for

the use of said Indians; and also shall, in due and proper form, execute a

mortgage upon one hundred thousand acres of the land contemplated in

and by said treaty to aid in the construction of said railroad, the said one

hundred thousand acres to be the lands designated in the letter of the

Commissioner of Indian Affairs to the Secretary of the Interior, dated

May 29, 1861 ; said mortgage to be conditioned for the full payment of

said bonds, both as to interest and principal, and that on any failure to

pay either when due all right and interest of said Railroad Company in

and to said mortgaged land, and also to all such of said land not mort-

gaged as shall not at that time be earned and patented according to said

treaty, shall be forfeited, and said land again become the absolute prop-

erty of the United States in trust for said Indians ; and said mortgaged

lands to be in no event patented to said

until said bonds, principal

Railroad company to execute bonds and mortgage.

and interest, shall be fully paid. And upon said bonds being so made and deposited, and said mortgage being so executed and duly recorded in Leavenworth county, Kansas, all matters, so far as not necessarily varied by this arrangement, shall proceed in conformity to said treaty, as if the money had been paid by said Railroad Company and had been invested by the President in said railroad bonds : Provided always, that this arrangement shall be of no effect until Archibald Williams, Judge of the United States Court for the District of Kansas, shall have endorsed a certificate upon this paper that he has carefully examined the same, and also the bonds and mortgage offered in compliance with its provisions, and has found that bonds and mortgage do in fact comply with and fulfil said provisions ; .and also that he has had before him the chiefs and headmen named in said treaty, as John Connor, Sar-cox-ie, Ne-con-he-con, and Rock-a-to-wha, and has fully explained to them the nature and effect of this departure from the terms of said treaty, and that they freely assented to the same.

Preamble. Militia called ut.
Persons in combination to disperse.
Extraordinary session of Congress convened.

Wher eas the laws of the United States have been, for some time past, and now are opposed, and the execution thereof obstructed, in the States of South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas, by combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings, or by the powers vested in the marshals by law :
Now, therefore, I, ABRAHAM LINCOLN, President of the United States, in virtue of the power in me vested by (he Constitution and the laws, have thought fit to call forth, and hereby do call forth, the militia of the several States of the Union, to the aggregate number of seventy-five thousand, in order to suppress said combinations, and to cause the laws to be duly executed.
The details for this object will be immediately communicated to- the State authorities through the War Department.
I appeal to all loyal citizens to favor, facilitate, and aid this effort to maintain the honor, the integrity, and the existence of our National Union, and the perpetuity of popular government; and to redress wrongs already long enough endured.
I deem it proper to say that the first service assigned to the forces hereby called forth will probably be to repossess the forts, places, and property which have been seized from the Union ; and in every event, the utmost care will be observed, consistently with the objects aforesaid, to avoid any devastation, any destruction of, or interference with, property, or any disturbance of peaceful citizens in any part of the country.
And I hereby command the persons composing the combinations aforesaid to disperse, and retire peaceably to their respective abodes within twenty days from this date.
Deeming that the present condition of public affairs presents an extraordinary occasion, I do hereby, in virtue of the power in me vested by the Constitution, convene both Houses of Congress. Senators and Representatives are therefore summoned to assemble at their respective chambers, at twelve o'clock, noon, on Thursday, the fourth day of July next, then and there to consider and determine such measures as, in their wisdom, the public safety and interest may seem to demand.
In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.

to commit assaults on the lives, vessels, and property of good citizens of the country lawfully engaged in commerce on the high seas, and in waters of the United States:
And whereas an Executive Proclamation has been already issued, requiring the persons engaged in these disorderly proceedings to desist therefrom, calling out a militia force for the purpose of repressing the same, and convening Congress in extraordinary session to deliberate and determine thereon:
Now, therefore, I, ABRAHAM LINCOLN, President of the United States, with a view to the same purposes before mentioned, and to the protection of the public peace, and the lives and property of quiet and orderly citizens pursuing their lawful occupations, until Congress shall have assembled and deliberated on the said unlawful proceedings, or until the same shall have ceased, have further
deemed it advisable to set on foot a blockade of the ports within the States aforesaid, in pursuance of the, laws of the United States and of the law of nations in such case provided. For this purpose a competent force will be posted so as to pre, vent entrance and exit of vessels from the ports aforesaid. If, therefore, with a view to violate such blockade, a vessel shall approach, or shall attempt to leave either of the said ports, she will be duly warned by the commander of one of the blot hading vessels, who will indorse on her register the fact and date of such warning, and if the same vessel shall again attempt to enter or leave the blockaded port, she will be captured and sent to the nearest convenient port, for such proceedings against her and her cargo as prize, as may be deemed advisable.
And I hereby proclaim and declare that if any person, under the pretended authority of the said States, or under any other pretence, shall molest a vessel of the United States, or the persons or cargo on board of her, such person will be held amenable to the laws of the United States for the prevention and punishment of piracy.

Whe re as existing exigencies demand immediate and adequate measures for the protection of the national Constitution and the preservation of the national Union by the suppression of the insurrectionary combinations now existing in several States for opposing the laws of the Union and obstructing the execution thereof, to which end a military force in addition to that called forth by my Proclamation of the fifteenth day of April in the present year, appears to be indispensably necessary:
Now, therefore, I, ABRAHAM LINCOLN, President of the United States, and Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy thereof, and of the Militia of the several States when called into actual service, do hereby call into the service of the United States forty-two thousand and thirty-four volunteers, to serve for the period of three years unless sooner discharged, and to be mustered into service as infantry and cavalry. The proportions of each arm and the details of enrollment and organization will be made known through the Department of War.
And I also direct that the regular army of the United States be increased by the addition of eight regiments of infantry, one regiment of cavalry, and one regiment of artillery, making altogether a maximum aggregate increase of twenty-two thousand seven hundred and fourteen, officers and enlisted men, the details of which increase will also be made known through the Department of War.
And I further direct the enlistment for not less than one or more than three years, of eighteen thousand seamen, in addition to the present force, for the naval service of the United States. The details of the enlistment and organization will be made known through the Department of the Navy.
The call for volunteers, hereby made, and the direction for the increase of the regular army, and for the enlistment of seamen hereby given, together with the plan of organization adopted for the volunteers and for the regular forces hereby authorized will be submitted to Congress as soon as assembled.
In the mean time I earnestly invoke the cooperation of all good citizens in the measures hereby adopted, for the effectual suppression of unlawful violence, for the impartial enforcement of constitutional laws, and for the speediest possible restoration of peace and order, and, with these, of happiness and prosperity throughout the country.
