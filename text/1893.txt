Sec . 3. That before said railway shall be constructed through any lands held by individual occupants according to the laws, customs, and usages of any of the Indian nations or tribes through which it may be constructed, full compensation shall be made to such occupants for all property to be taken or damage done by reason of the construction of such railway. In case of failure to make amicable settlement with any occupant, such compensation shall be determined by the appraisement of three disinterested referees to be appointed by the President of the United States, who, before entering upon the duties of their appointment, shall take and subscribe before competent authority an oath that they will faithfully and impartially discharge the duties of their appointment, which oath, duly certified, shall be returned with their award. In case the referees can not agree, then any two of them are authorized to make the award. Either party being dissatisfied with the finding of the referees shall have the right, within ninety days after the making of the award and notice of the same, to appeal by original petition to the courts, where the case shall be tried de novo. When proceedings have been commenced in court the railway company shall pay double the amount of the award into court to abide the judgement thereof, and then have the right to enter upon the property sought to be condemned, and proceed with the construction of the railroad. Each of said referees shall receive for his services the sum of four dollars per day for each day they are engaged in the trial of any case submitted to them under this act, with mileage at five cents per mile. Witnesses shall receive the usual fees allowed by the courts of said nations. Costs, including compensation of the referees, shall be made a part of the award and be paid by such railroad company.

In case of failure to make amicable settlement with any occupant, such compensation shall be determined by the appraisement of three disinterested referees, to be appointed, one (who shall act as chairman) by the President of the United States, one by the chief of the nation to which said occupant belongs, and one by said railroad company, who, before entering upon the duties of their appointments, shall take and subscribe, before a district judge, clerk of a district court, or United States Commissioner, an oath that they will faithfully and impartially discharge the duties of their appointments, which oath, duly certified, shall be returned with their award to and filed with the Secretary of the Interior within sixty days from the completion thereof; and a majority of said referees shall be competent to act in the case of the absence of a member, after due notice.

Sec . 10. That when any right of way is to be condemned under this act said court in special term shall cause a jury of seven judicious, disinterested men, not related to any person interested in the proceedings, and not in the service or employment of the District of Columbia or of the United States, to be summoned by the marshal, and shall administer to the jury an oath or affirmation that they will, without favor or partiality to anyone, to the best of their judgment, determine such questions as may be submitted to them by the court during the proceedings.

A PROCLAMATION.

Preamble. Vol. 22, p. 30. Pardon to polygamous Mormons abstaining from unlawful cohabitation since November 1, 1890.

Whereas, Congress, by a statute approved March 22, 1882, and by statutes in furtherance and amendment thereof, defined the crimes of bigamy, polygamy and unlawful cohabitation in the Territories and other places within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States and prescribed a penalty for such crimes; and
Whereas, ou or about the 6th day of October, 1890, the Church of the Latter Day Saints, commonly known as the Mormon Church, through its President, issued a manifesto proclaiming the purpose of said Church no longer to sanction the practice of polygamous marriages, and calling upon all members and adherents of said church to obey the laws of the United States in reference to said subject matter; and
Whereas, it is represented that since the date of said declaration the members and adherents of said Church have generally obeyed said laws and have abstained from plural marriages and polygamous cohabitation; and
Whereas, by a petition dated December 19,1891, the officials of said Church, pledging the membership thereof to a faithful obedience to the laws against plural marriage and unlawful cohabitation, have applied to me to grant amnesty for past offences against said laws, which request a very large number of influential non-Mormons, residing in the Territories, have also strongly urged; and
Whereas, the Utah Commission, in their report bearing date September 15, 1892, recommend that said petition be granted and said amnesty proclaimed, under proper conditions as to the future observance of the law, with a view to the encouragement of those now disposed to become law-abiding citizens; and
Whereas, during the past two years such amnesty has been granted to individual applicants in a very large number of cases, conditioned upon the faithful observance of the laws of the United States against unlawful cohabitation; and there are now pending many more such applications;
Now, therefore, I, Benj amin Harri son , President of the United States, by virtue of the powers in me vested, do hereby declare and grant a full amnesty and pardon to all persons liable to the penalties of said Act by reason of unlawful cohabitation under the color of polygamous or plural marriage, who have since November 1, 1899, abstained from such unlawful cohabitation; but upon the express condition that they shall in the future faithfully obey the laws of the United States hereinbefore named, and not otherwise. Those who shall fail to avail themselves of the clemency hereby offered will be vigorously prosecuted.
In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.

Whereas, the above order was issued in consequence of the imposition by the Government of the Dominion of Canada of a discriminating toll whereby unjust and unreasonable burdens were placed, in violation of article 27 of the Treaty of Washington, upon the carrying of passengers and cargoes through the Welland Canal in transit to ports of the United States, as is fully set forth in the said proclamation; and
Whereas, by an Order in Council dated February 13, 1893, the Governor General of the Dominion of Canada has directed that "for the season of 1893, the canal tolls for the passage of the following food products, wheat, Indian corn, peas, barley, rye, oats, flax seed and buckwheat, for passage eastward through the Welland Canal be 10 1cents per ton; and for passage westward through the St. Lawrence Canals only 10 cents per ton; payment of the said toll of 10 cents per ton for passage through the Welland Canal to entitle these products to free passage through the St. Lawrence Canals;" aud
Whereas, I have received satisfactory assurances that this order revokes during the season of 1893 the discriminating provisions above referred to and secures to citizens of the United States equality with British subjects as regards the use of said canals:--

"Arti cl e III.

" Every vessel or person offending against this prohibition in the

said waters of Behring Sea outside of the ordinary territorial limits of

the United States, may be seized and detainer! by the naval or other

duly commissioned officers of either of the High Contracting Parties,

but they shall be handed over as soon as practicable to the authorities

of the Nation to which they respectively belong, who alone shall have

jurisdiction to try the offence and impose the penalties for the same.

The witnesses and proof necessary to establish the offence shall also

be sent with them."

Now, therefore, I, Grover Cleveland, President of the United States,

hereby warn all persons against entering the waters of Behring Sea

within the dominion of the United States for the purpose of violating

the provisions of said section 1956, of the Revised Statutes, and of the

said articles of said Convention; and I hereby proclaim that all per-

sons found to be, or to have been engaged in any violation of the laws

of the United States, or of the provisions of said Convention, in said

waters, will be arrested, proceeded against, and punished as above pro-

vided.

Preamble. Vol. 26, p. 1103. Forest reservation, California. Boundaries.

Whereas, it is provided by section twenty-four of the Act of Congress, approved March third, eighteen hundred and ninety-one, entitled,. "An act to repeal timber-culture laws, and for other purposes," "That the President of the United States may, from time to time, set apart and reserve, in any State or Territory having public land bearing forests, in any part of the public lands wholly or in part covered with timber or undergrowth, whether of commercial value or not, as public reservations, and the President shall, by public proclamation, declare the establishment of such reservations and the limits thereof;"
And Whereas, the public lands in the State of California, within the limits hereinafter described, are in part covered with timber, and it appears that the public good would be promoted by setting apart and reserving said lands as a public reservation;
Now, Therefore, I, Benja min Harri son , President of the United States, by virtue of the power in me vested by section twenty-four of the aforesaid Act of Congress, do hereby make known and proclaim that there is hereby reserved from entry or settlement and set apart as a Public Reservation, all those certain tracts, pieces or parcels of land lying and being situate in the State of California, and within the boundaries particularly described as follows, to-wit:
Beginning at the north-west corner of Township three (3) North, Range five (5) West, San Bernardino Meridian, California; thence southerly along the surveyed and unsurveyed range line between Ranges five (5) and six (6) West, to the north-west corner of Section eighteen (18), Township one (1) North, Range five (5) West; thence easterly along the section line between Sections seven (7) and eighteen (18) to the western boundary of the "Rancho Muscupiabe"; thence easterly, following the western and northern boundary of said rancho, to the point where said boundary intersects the section line between Sections nineteen (19) and thirty (30), Township one (1) North, Range three (3) West; thence easterly along the section lines to the north-east corner of Section twenty-five (25), said township and range; thence southerly along the range line between Ranges two (2) and three (3) West, to the San Bernardino Base Line; thence easterly along said base line to the north-east corner of Section four (4), Township one (1) South, Range two (2) West, southerly along the unsurveyed and surveyed section lines to the north-east corner of Section sixteen (10), easterly along the section lines to the north-east corner of Section thirteen (13) and southerly to the south-east corner of Section thirteen (13), all of said township and range; thence easterly to a point for the center of Township one (1) South, Range one (1) West; thence southerly to a point for the southwest corner of Section thirty-four (34), in said township and range; thence easterly along the surveyed and unsurveyed township line between Townships one (1) and two (2) South, to the San Bernardino Meridian; thence southerly along said meridan to the north-east corner of Township three (3) South, Range one (1) West; thence easterly through the Maronge Indian Reservation to the south-east corner of Township two (2) South, Range three (3) East; thence northerly along the surveyed and unsurveyed range line to the north-east corner of said township; thence easterly to a point for the south-east corner of Township one (1) South, Range four (4) East; thence northerly along the surveyed and unsurveyed range line between Ranges four (4) and five (5) East, to the north-east corner of Section twenty-four (24), Township three (3) North, Range four (4) East; thence westerly along the surveyed and unsurveyed section lines to the south-west corner of Section eighteen (18), Township three (3) North, Range (3) East; thence

Excepting from the force and effect of this proclamation all lands which may have been, prior to the date hereof, embraced in any legal entry or covered by any lawful filing duly of record in the proper United States Land Office, or upon which any valid settlement has been made pursuant to law, and the statutory period within which to make entry or filing of record has not expired; and all mining claims duly located and held according to the laws of the United States and rules and regulations not in conflict therewith;
Provided that this exception shall not continue to apply to any particular tract of land unless the entryman, settler or claimant continues to comply with the law under which the entry, filing, settlement or location was made.
Warning is hereby expressly given to all persons not to enter or make settlement upon the tract of land reserved by this proclamation.
In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused ths seal of the United States to be affixed.

Preamble. Designating Thursday, November 30, as Thanksgiving Day.

While the American people should every day remember with praise and thanksgiving the divine goodness and mercy which have followed them since their beginning as a nation, it is fitting that one day in each year should be especially devoted to the contemplation of the blessings we have received from the hand of God, and to the grateful acknowledgment of His loving kindness.
Therefore, I, Grover Cleveland, President of the United States, do hereby designate and set apart Thursday, the thirtieth day of the present month of November, as a day of Thanksgiving and praise to be kept and observed by all the people of our land. On that day let us forego our ordinary work and employments, and assemble in our usual places of worship where we may recall all that God has done for us, and where from grateful hearts our united tribute of praise and song may reach the Throne of Grace. Let the re union of kindred and the social meeting of friends lend cheer and enjoyment to the day, and let generous gifts of charity for the relief of the poor and needy prove the sincerity of our thanksgiving.

Preamble. Designating Thursday, November 30, as Thanksgiving Day.

While the American people should every day remember with praise and thanksgiving the divine goodness and mercy which have followed them since their beginning as a nation, it is fitting that one day in each year should be especially devoted to the contemplation of the blessings we have received from the hand of God, and to the grateful acknowledgment of His loving kindness.
Therefore, I, Grover Cleveland, President of the United States, do hereby designate and set apart Thursday, the thirtieth day of the present month of November, as a day of Thanksgiving and praise to be kept and observed by all the people of our land. On that day let us forego our ordinary work and employments, and assemble in our usual places of worship where we may recall all that God has done for us, and where from grateful hearts our united tribute of praise and song may reach the Throne of Grace. Let the re union of kindred and the social meeting of friends lend cheer and enjoyment to the day, and let generous gifts of charity for the relief of the poor and needy prove the sincerity of our thanksgiving.

Witness my hand and the seal of the United States, which I have caused to be hereto affixed.

Copyright benefits extended to subjects of Portugal.

Whereas it is provided by section 13 of the act of Congress of March 3, 1891, entitled " An Act to amend title sixty, chapter three, of the Revised Statutes of the United States, relating to copyrights", that said act " shall only apply to a citizen or subject of a foreign state or nation

when such foreign state or nation permits to citizens of the United States of America the benefit of copyright on substantially the same basis as its own citizens; or when such foreign state or nation is a party

to an international agreement which provides for reciprocity in the granting of copyright, by the terms of which agreement tbe United States of America may, at its pleasure, become a party to such agreement";
And whereas it is also provided by said section that "the existence of either of the conditions aforesaid shall be determined by the Presi-

dent of the United States by proclamation made from time to time as

the purposes of this act may require";

And whereas satisfactory official assurances have been given that in

Portugal the law permits to citizens of the United States the benefit of

copyright on substantially the same basis as to the subjects of Portugal:

Now, therefore, I, Grover Cleveland, President of the United States

of America, do declare and proclaim that the first of the conditions

specified in section 13 of the act of March 3, 1891, now exists and is

fulfilled in respect to the subjects of Portugal.

In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the

seal of the United States to be affixed.

2. Each entry shall be in a compact body, according to the rectangular subdivisions of the public surveys, and in a square form, as nearly as reasonably practicable, consistently with such surveys, and no person shall be permitted to enter more than one quarter section in quantity of said lands. (See section 13, act of March 2,1889,25 Stat., 1005).
3. Parties who own and reside upon land (not acquired by them under the homestead law), not amounting in quantity to a quarter section, may, if otherwise qualified, enter other land lying contiguous to their own to an amount which shall not, with the land already owned by them, exceed in the aggregate 160 acres. (See section 2289, U. S. R. S.).
4. Any party, who has made a homestead entry prior to March second, eighteen hundred and eighty-nine, for less than one quarter section of land and who still owns and occupies the land so entered, may, if otherwise qualified, enter an additional tract of land lying contiguous to the land embraced in the original entry, which shall not, with the land first entered, exceed in the aggregate one hundred and sixty acres, but such additional entry will not be permitted, or if permitted will be canceled, if the original entry should fail, for any reason prior to patent, or should appear to be illegal or fraudulent. The final proof of residence and cultivation made on the original entry, together with the payment of the prescribed price for the land, will be sufficient to entitle the party to a final certificate for the land so entered without further proof. (See section 5 of the act of March 2,1889,25 Stat., 854).
5. Parties who have complied with the conditions of the law with regard to a homestead entry for less than one hundred and sixty acres of land made prior to March second, eighteen hundred and eighty-nine, and have had the final papers issued therefor, may, if otherwise qualified, make an additional entry, by legal subdivisions, of so much land as, added to the quantity previously so entered, shall not exceed one hundred and sixty acres.

(See sections 2304, 2307, and 2309 U. S. R. S.).
7. Every person entitled under the preceding paragraph to enter a homestead, who, or whose deceased husband or father in case of the widow or minor children, may have, prior to June twenty-second, eighteen hundred and seventy-four, entered, under the homestead laws, a quantity of land less than one hundred and sixty acres, may, if otherwise qualified, enter so much land as, when added to the quantity previously entered, shall not exceed one hundred and sixty acres, but the party must make affidavit that the entry is made for actual settlement and cultivation, and the proof of such settlement and cultivation, prescribed by existing homestead laws and regulations thereunder, will be required to be produced before the issue of final certificate. (See

section 2306 U. S. R. S., and section 18 of the act of May 2, 1890, 26 Stat., 90).
8. Parties may initiate claims under the homestead law either by settlement on the land or by entry at the district office; in the former case, the party will have three months after settlement within which to file his application lor the tract at the district office; in the latter case, the party will have six months after entry at that office, within which to establish residence and begin improvements upon the land. (See sections 2290 and 2297, U. S. R. S.; and section 3, of the act of May 14, 1880, 21 Stat., 140).
9. The homestead affidavits required to be filed with the application must be executed before the register or receiver of the proper district land office (see section 2290, U. S. R. S.), or before any other officer who may be found duly qualified at the time to administer such oaths according to the provisions of the act of Congress of May 26, 1890, 26 Stat., 121.
10.Parties applying to make homestead entry will be required to tender with the application the legal fee and commissions which are as follows: for an entry of over eighty acres a fee of ten dollars, and for an entry of eighty acres or less a fee of five dollars, and, in both cases, in addition, commissions, of two per cent upon the Government price of the land, computed at the rate of $1.25 per acre, the ordinary minimum price of public lands under the general provisions of section 2357, U. S. R. S. (See sections 2238 and 2290 U. S. R. S.)
11.Homestead applicants appearing in great number at the local office to make entry at the time of opening will be required to form in line in order that their applications may be presented and acted upon in regular order.
12.Soldiers' declaratory statements can only be made by the parties entitled or by their agents in person, and will not be received if sent by mail. A party acting as agent and appearing in line, as contemplated under the eleventh paragraph, will be allowed to make one entry or filing in his individual character, if he so desires, and to file one declaratory statement in his representative character as agent, if such he shall be, and thereupon he will be required to step out of line, giving place to the next person in order, and, if he desires to make any other filings, to take his place at the end of the line and await his proper turn before doing so, and thus to proceed in order until all the filings desired by him shall be made.
13.Section two thousand three hundred and one of the Revised Statutes of the United States providing for commutation of homestead entries is not applicable to said lands. (See section 18 of the act of May 2, 1890, 26 Stat., 90).
14.Proof of five years' residence, cultivation, and improvement, and the payment prescribed by the statute, as hereinbefore mentioned must be made, before a party will be entitled to a patent under the homestead law, and such proof is required to be made within seven years from the date of the entry. Commissions equal to two per cent, upon the Government price for the land, computed at $1.25 per acre under sections 2357 U. S. R. S., must also be tendered with the final proof. Interest at four per cent, per annum on the purchase price of the land must be paid from the date of the entry to date of final payment of purchase money. (See sections 2238 and 2291 U. S. R. S.,; and sections 10 and 13 of the act of March 3, 1893, 27 Stats. 640).
15.The parties named in paragraph six of these regulations are entitled to have the term of service in the Army or Navy, under which the claim is made, not exceeding four years, deducted from the period of five years' residence or cultivation required as stated in the preceding paragraph, or if the party was discharged from service on account of wounds or disabilities incurred in the line of duty, the whole term of enlistment not exceeding four years, may be deducted.

title will vest in them, respectively. (See section 2291 U. S. R. S.). 17. Where both parents die, leaving infant children, the homestead
may be sold for cash for the benefit of such children, and the purchaser will receive title from the United States. (See section 2292, U. S. R. S.).
18. In case of the death of a person after having entered a homestead, the failure of the widow, children, or devisee of the deceased to fulfill the demands of the letter of the law as to residence on the lands, will not necessarily subject the entry to forfeiture on the ground of abandonment. If the land is cultivated in good faith the law will be considered as having been substantially complied with.
19. Town site claims may be initiated upon said lands, under the statutes, by two methods, which are separate and distinct in character-- the regulations under the first method are hereinafter set forth in para-

graphs twenty, twenty-one and twenty-two, and under the second method in paragraphs twenty-three to twenty-eight, inclusive. Provision is further made for town-site entries in cases where lands entered

Filing plat.

under the homestead law are required for town-site purposes as set forth in paragraph thirty.
20. Parties having founded or who desire to found a city or town on the public lands, must file with the recorder of the county in which land is situate a plat thereof, describing the exterior boundaries of the land according to the lines of public surveys. Such plat must state the name of the city or town, exhibit the streets, squares, blocks, lots and alleys, and specify the size of the same, with measurements and area of each municipal subdivision, the lots in which shall not exceed 4,200 square feet, with a statement of the extent and general character of the improvements. The plat and statement must be verified by the oath of the party acting for and in behalf of the occupants and inhabitants of the town or city. Within one month after filing the plat with the recorder of the county a verified copy of said plat and statement must be sent to the General Land Office, accompanied by the testimony of two witnesses that such town or city has been

established in good faith, and a similar map and statement must be filed with the Register and receiver of the proper district office. Thereafter the President may cause the lots embraced within the limits of such city or town to be offered at public sale to the highest bidder

subject to a minimum of ten dollars for each lot; and such lots as may not be disposed of at public sale shall thereafter be liable to private entry at such minimum, or at such reasonable increase or diminution thereafter as the Secretary of the Interior may order from time to time, after at least three months' notice, in view of the increase or decrease in the value of the municipal property. Any actual settler upon any lot and upon any additional lot upon which he may have substantial improvements, shall be entitled to prove up and purchase the same as a pre-emption, at such minimum, at any time before the day fixed for the public sale. (See section 2382 U. S. R. S.) Sale of lots on fail- 21. In case the parties interested shall fail or refuse, within twelve ure to file plat. months after founding a city or town, to file in the General Land Office a transcript map, with the statement and testimony, as required in paragraph twenty, the Secretary of the Interior may cause a survey and plat to be made of said city or town, and thereafter the lots will be sold at an increase of fifty per cent, on the minimum price of $10 per lot. (See section 2384 U. S. R. S.).

22. When lots vary in size from the limitation of 4200 square feet, and the lots, buildings, and improvements cover an area greater than

640 acres, such variance as to size of lots or excess in area will prove no bar to entry, but the price of the lots may be increased to such rea-

sonaoie amount as the Secretary of the Interior may by rule establish.
(See section 2385 U. S. R. S.). 23. Under the second method lands actually settled upon and
occupied as a townsite, and therefore not subject to entry under the homestead laws, may be entered as a townsite, at the proper district land office. (See section 2387 U. S. R. S.).
24. If the town is incorporated, the entry may be made by the corporate authorities thereof through the mayor or other principal officer duly authorized so to do. If the town is not incorporated, the entry may be made by the judge of the county court for the county in which said town is situated. In either case the entry must be made in trust for the use and benefit of the occupants thereof, according to their respective interests. The execution of such trust as to the disposal of lots and the proceeds of sales is to be conducted under regulations prescribed by the territorial laws. Acts of trustees not in accordance with such regulations are void. (See sections 2387 and 2391U. S. R. S.).
25. The officer authorized to enter a town-site may make entry at once, or he may initiate an entry by filing a declaratory statement of the purpose of the inhabitants to make a town-site entry of the land described. The entry or declaratory statement shall include only such land as is actually occupied by the town, and the title to which is in the United States, and its exterior limits must conform to the legal subdivisions of the public lands. (See sections 2388 and 2389 U. S. R. S.)
26. The amount of land that may be entered under this method is proportionate to the number of inhabitants. One hundred and less than two hundred inhabitants may enter not to exceed 320 acres; two hundred and less than one thousand inhabitants may enter not to exceed 640 acres; and where the inhabitants number one thousand and over, an amount not to exceed 1280 acres may be entered; and for each additional one thousand inhabitants, not to exceed five thousand in all, a further amount of 320 acres may be allowed. When the number of inhabitants of a town is less than one hundred, the town-site shall be restricted to the land actually occupied for town purposes by legal subdivisions. (See section 2389 U. S. R. S.)
27. Where an entry is made of less than the maximum quantity of land allowed for town-site purposes, additional entries may be made of contiguous tracts occupied for town purposes, which, when added to the previous entry or entries, will not exceed 2,560 acres; but no additional entry can be allowed which will make the total area exceed the area to which the town may be entitled by virtue of its population at date of additional entry. (See sec. 4 of the act of March 3,1877,19 Stat., 392.)
28. The land must be paid for at the Government price per acre, and proof must be furnished relating--1st. To municipal occupation of the land; 2d, Number of inhabitants; 3d, Extent and value of town improvements; 4th, Date when land was first used for town-site purposes; 5th, Official character and authority of officer making entry; 6th, If an incorporated town, proof of incorporation, which should be a certified copy of the act of incorporation; and 7th, That a majority of the occupants or owners of the lots within the town desire that such action be taken. Thirty days' publication of notice of intention to make proof must be made and proof of publication furnished. (See section 2387 U. S. R. S.)
29. All surveys for town-sites on said lands shall contain reservations for parks (of substantially equal area if more than one park) and for schools and other public purposes embracing in the aggregate not less than ten nor more than twenty acres, and patents for such reservations, to be maintained for such purposes, will be issued to the towns respectively when organized as municipalities. (See section 22, act of May 2, 1890, 26 Stat., 92.)
30. In case any of said lands which may be entered under the homestead laws by a person who is entitled to perfect his title thereto under such laws, are required for town-site purposes, the entryman may

The party must file, in the district office with his application, a plat of the proposed town-site, and evidence of his qualifications to perfect title under the homestead law, and of his compliance with all the requirements of the law and the instructions thereunder, and must deposit with the Secretary of the Interior the sum of ten dollars per acre for all the lands embraced in such town-site, except the lands to be donated and maintained for public purposes as mentioned in the preceding paragraph. (See section 22, act of May 2, 1890, 26 Stat., 92.)
Notice, moreover, is hereby given that it is by law enacted that no person shall be permitted to occupy or enter upon any of the lauds herein referred to, except in the manner prescribed by this proclamation; and any person otherwise occupying or entering upon any of said lands shall forfeit all right to acquire any of said lands, and that the officers of the United States will be required to enforce this provision.
