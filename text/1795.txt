ported from districts into which the same are imported, and great loss and inconvenience are experienced from such limitation, and further provision, in respect to goods, wares or merchandise entitled to drawback, is deemed necessary:
Sec . 1. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That after the last day of March next, any goods, wares and merchandise imported into the United States, may be exported from any of the ports at which ships and vessels from the Cape of Good Hope, or from any place beyond the same, are admitted to make entry, and entitled to the same drawback of the duties, as goods, wares and merchandise exported from the districts into which they are imported, are now entitled to: Provided nevertheless, That such goods, wares and merchandise shall not be entitled to such drawback, unless they shall be accompanied by a certificate from the collector of the district into which they were imported, specifying the marks, numbers and descriptions of the casks or packages, with the names of the master and vessel in which, the time when, and the place, from whence they were imported; and where the articles pay duties by weight or measure, the quantity in each; and in all cases, the amount of the duties paid or secured thereon.
Sec . 2. And be it further enacted, That in order to entitle any person to such certificate, he or they shall make out an entry of all such goods, wares and merchandise, specifying the marks, numbers and descriptions of the casks or packages and their contents, the names of the master and vessel in which, the time when, and the place from which they were imported; the names of the master and vessel in which they are intended to be laden, and the district in the United States to which they are destined; and shall moreover make oath or affirmation to the truth of such entry; which requisites being complied with, and the collector satisfied with the truth thereof, he shall grant such certificate, and such goods, wares and merchandise shall be entered with the collector of the district, into which they shall be brought from the place of their importation, previous to the landing or unlading thereof.
Sec . 3. And be it further enacted, That after the last day of March next, it shall be lawful for the importer or exporter of any liquors in casks, coffee in casks or other packages, or any unrefined sugars, to fill up the casks or packages, out of other casks or packages included in the original importation, or into new casks or packages, in case the original cask or package shall be so injured, as to be rendered unfit for exportation, and under the inspection of the inspector of the port, from which such liquors, coffee or unrefined sugars are intended to be exported.
Sec . 4.

And such certificate shall entitle the possessor thereof, to receive from the collector of the district, with whom the duties on the said goods, wares and merchandise were paid or secured, a debenture or debentures for the drawback expressed in the said certificates, payable at the same time, and in like manner, as is herein directed for debentures on goods, wares and merchandise exported from the place of their first importation: Provided nevertheless, That the collector aforesaid may refuse to grant such debenture or debentures, in case it shall appear to him, that any error has arisen, or any fraud has been committed; and in case of such refusal, if the debenture or debentures claimed shall exceed one hundred dollars, it shall be his duty to represent the case to the Comptroller of the Treasury, who shall determine, whether such debenture or debentures shall be granted or not: And provided always, That in no case of an exportation by the original importer, shall a drawback be paid, until the duties on the importation thereof shall have been
first received. Sec . 6. And be it further enacted, That before the receipt of any
such debenture, in case of exportation from the district of original importation, and in case of exportation from any other district, before the receipt of any such certificate, the person applying for the same shall give bond with one or more sureties, to the satisfaction of the collector who is to grant the debenture, or the certificate, as the case may be, in a sum equal to double the amount of the sum, for which such debenture or certificate is granted, conditioned to produce to such collector, like proof and certificates of the delivery of such goods, wares or merchandise, at some place without the United States, as are now required by law for obtaining the drawback on exportation, within one year, in case such goods have been shipped to any part of Europe or America, and within two years, if to any part of Asia or Africa : Provided nevertheless, That when it shall be made appear to the satisfaction of the collector, to whom such certificates are directed to be returned, that such certificates could not be obtained, the exporter or exporters shall be permitted to offer such other testimony, as to the landing or loss of the goods, wares and merchandise, as he may have; which proof shall be referred to the Comptroller of the Treasury, who shall have power and authority to admit the same, if he shall deem it satisfactory, and to direct the collector to cancel the bond accordingly.
Sec . 7. And be it further enacted, That so much of the act, intituled "An act to provide more effectually for the collection of the duties imposed by law on goods, wares and merchandise imported into the United States, and on the tonnage of ships or vessels," as extends the credits on bonds given for duties on account of the drawback on goods exported, shall, after the said last day of March next, be repealed : Provided, That nothing herein contained shall be construed to extend to any allowance made upon goods, wares and merchandise imported before the said last day of March next.

And the said Indian tribes will also allow to the people of the United States the free use of the harbours and mouths of rivers along the lakes adjoining the Indian lands, for sheltering vessells and boats, and liberty to land their cargoes where necessary for their safety.

ARTICLE IV.

In consideration of the peace now established and of the cessions and relinquishments of lands made in the preceding article by the said tribes of Indians, and to manifest the liberality of the United States, as the great means of rendering this peace strong and perpetual; the United States relinquish their claims to all other Indian lands northward of the river Ohio, eastward of the Mississippi, and westward and southward of the Great Lakes and the waters uniting them, according to the boundary line agreed on by the United States and the king of Great-Britain, in the treaty of peace made between them in the year 1783. But from this relinquishment by the United States, the following tracts of land, are explicitly excepted. 1st. The tract of one hundred and fifty thousand acres near the rapids of the river Ohio, which has been assigned to General Clark, for the use of himself and his warriors. 2d. The post of St. Vincennes on the river Wabash, and the lands adjacent, of which the Indian title has been extinguished. 3d. The lands at all other places in possession of the French people and other white settlers among them, of which the Indian title has been extinguished as mentioned in the 3d article; and 4th. The post of fort Massac towards the mouth of the Ohio. To which several parcels of land so excepted, the said tribes relinquish all the title and claim which they or any of them may have.
And for the same considerations and with the same views as above mentioned, the United States now deliver to the said Indian tribes a quantity of goods to the value of twenty thousand dollars, the receipt
whereof they do hereby acknowledge; and henceforward every year forever the United States will deliver at some convenient place northward of the river Ohio, like usefull goods, suited to the circumstances
of the Indians, of the value of nine thousand five hundred dollars; reckoning that value at the first cost of the goods in the city or place in the United States, where they shall be procured. The tribes to which those goods are to be annually delivered, and the proportions in which they are to be delivered, are the following.
1st. To the Wyandots, the amount of one thousand dollars. 2d. To the Delawares, the amount of one thousand dollars. 3d. To the Shawanese, the amount of one thousand dollars. 4th. To the Miamis, the amount of one thousand dollars. 5th. To the Ottawas, the amount of one thousand dollars. 6th. To the Chippewas, the amount of one thousand dollars. 7th. To the Putawatimes, the amount of one thousand dollars. 8th. And to the Kickapoo, Weea, Eel-river, Piankashaw and Kaskaskias tribes, the amount of five hundred dollars each.
Provided, That if either of the said tribes shall hereafter at an annual delivery of their share of the goods aforesaid, desire that a part of their annuity should be furnished in domestic animals, implements of husbandry, and other utensils convenient for them, and in compensation to usefull artificers who may reside with or near them, and be employed
for their benefit, the same shall at the subsequent annual deliveries be furnished accordingly.

TREATY WITH THE WYANDOTS, ETC. 1795.

Indians have right to hunt o lands relinquished by U.S. &c.

ARTICLE V.
To prevent any misunderstanding about the Indian lands relinquished by the United States in the fourth article, it is now explicitly declared, that the meaning of that relinquishment is this: The Indian tribes who have a right to those lands, are quietly to enjoy them, hunting, planting, and dwelling thereon so long as they please, without any molestation from the United States; but when those tribes, or any of them, shall be disposed to sell their lands, or any part of them, they are to be sold only to the United States; and untill such sale, the United States will protect all the said Indian tribes in the quiet enjoyment of their lands against all citizens of the United States, and against all other white persons who intrude upon the same. And the said Indian tribes again acknowledge themselves to be under the protection of the said United States and no other power whatever.

Indians may expel settlers from their lands.

ARTICLE VI.
If any citizen of the United States, or any other white person or persons, shall presume to settle upon the lands now relinquished by the United States, such citizen or other person shall be out of the protection of the United States; and the Indian tribe, on whose land the settlement shall be made, may drive off the settler, or punish him in such manner as they shall think fit; and because such settlements made without the consent of the United States, will be injurious to them as well as to the Indians, the United States shall be at liberty to break them up, and remove and punish the settlers as they shall think proper, and so effect that protection of the Indian lands herein before stipulated.

Indians may hunt on lands ceded to U. S,
Trade to be opened with the Indians.

ARTICLE VII.
The said tribes of Indians, parties to this treaty, shall be at liberty to hunt within the territory and lands which they have now ceded to the United States, without hindrance or molestation, so long as they demean themselves peaceably, and offer no injury to the people of the United States.
ARTICLE VIII.
Trade shall be opened with the said Indian tribes; and they do hereby respectively engage to afford protection to such persons, with their property, as shall be duly licensed to reside among them for the purpose of trade, and to their agents and servants; but no person shall be permitted to reside at any of their towns or hunting camps as a trader, who is not furnished with a license for that purpose, under the hand and seal of the superintendent of the department north-west of the Ohio, or such other person as the President of the United States shall authorise to grant such licences; to the end, that the said Indians may not be imposed on in their trade. And if any licensed trader shall abuse his privilege by unfair dealing, upon complaint and proof thereof, his licence shall be taken from him, and he shall be further punished according to the laws of the United States. And if any person shall intrude himself as a trader, without such license, the said Indians shall take and bring him before the superintendent or his deputy, to be dealt with according to law. And to prevent impositions by forged licences, the said Indians shall at least once a year give information to the superintendent or his
deputies, of the names of the traders residing among them.

Retaliation restrained.

ARTICLE IX.
Lest the firm peace and friendship now established should be interrupted by the misconduct of individuals, the United States, and the said Indian tribes agree, that for injuries done by individuals on either side,

TREATY WITH THE WYANDOTS, ETC. 1795.

53

no private revenge or retaliation shall take place; but instead thereof, complaint shall be made by the party injured, to the other: By the said Indian tribes, or any of them, to the President of the United States, or the superintendant by him appointed; and by the superintendant or other person appointed by the President, to the principal chiefs of the said Indian tribes, or of the tribe to which the offender belongs; and such prudent measures shall then be pursued as shall be necessary to preserve the said peace and friendship unbroken, until the Legislature (or Great Council) of the United States, shall make other equitable provision in the case, to the satisfaction of both parties. Should any Indian tribes meditate a war against the United States or either of them, and the same shall come to the knowledge of the before-mentioned tribes, or either of them, they do hereby engage to give immediate notice thereof to the general or officer commanding the troops of the United States, at the nearest post. And should any tribe, with hostile intentions against the United States, or either of them, attempt to pass through their country, they will endeavour to prevent the same, and in like manner give information of such attempt, to the general or officer commanding, as soon as possible, that all causes of mistrust and suspicion may be avoided between them and the United States. In like manner the United States shall give notice to the said Indian tribes of any harm that may be meditated against them, or either of them, that shall come to their knowledge; and do all in their power to hinder and prevent the same, that the friendship between them may be uninterrupted.
ARTICLE X.
All other treaties heretofore made between the United States and the said Indian tribes, or any of them, since the treaty of 1783, between the United States and Great Britain, that come within the purview of this treaty, shall henceforth cease and become void.

Indians to give notice of designs against U.S.
Former treaties void.

In Testimony whereof, the said Anthony Wayne, and the Sachems and War-Chiefs of the before-mentioned Nations and Tribes of Indians, have hereunto set their Hands, and affixed their Seals. Done at Greeneville, in the Territory of the United States, northwest of the river Ohio, on the third Day of August, one thousand seven hundred and ninety-five.

TREATY OF FRIENDSHIP, LIMITS AND NAVIGATION,

Between the United States of America, and the King of Spain, (a)

Oct. 27, 1795. Peace established.

His Catholic Majesty and the United States of America, desiring to consolidate, on a permanent basis, the friendship and good correspondence, which happily prevails between the two parties, have determined to establish, by a convention, several points, the settlement whereof will be productive of general advantage and reciprocal utility to both
nations. With this intention, his Catholic Majesty has appointed the most
excellent Lord, don Manuel de Godoy, and Alvarez de Faria, Rios, Sanchez, Zarzosa, Prince de la Paz, duke de la Alcudia, lord of the Soto de Roma, and of the state of Albala, Grandee of Spain of the first class, perpetual regidor of the city of Santiago, knight of the illustrious order of the Golden Fleece, and Great Cross of the Royal and distinguished Spanish order of Charles the III. commander of Valencia, del Ventoso, Rivera, and Acenchal in that of Santiago; Knight and Great Cross of the religious order of St. John; Counsellor of state; first Secretary of state and despacho; Secretary to the Queen; Superintendant General of the posts and highways; Protector of the royal Academy of the noble arts, and of the royal societies of natural history, botany, chemistry, and astronomy; Gentleman of the King's chamber in employment; Captain General of his armies; Inspector and Major of the royal corps of body guards, &c. &c. &c. and the President of the United States, with the advice and consent of their Senate, has appointed Thomas Pinckney, a citizen of the United States, and their Envoy Extraordinary to his Catholic Majesty. And the said Plenipotentiaries have agreed upon and concluded the following articles:

ARTICLE I.

There shall be a firm and inviolable peace and sincere friendship between his Catholic Majesty, his successors and subjects, and the United States, and their citizens, without exception of persons or

places.

ARTICLE II.

To prevent all disputes on the subject of the boundaries which separate the territories of the two high contracting parties, it is hereby

(a) The treaties with Spain have been :

A Convention of Indemnification between the United States and Spain. August 11, 1802; post, 198.

jesty, negotiated February 22, 1819. Ratified by the President and Senate on the 19th February, 1821,

Decisions of the Courts of the United States in cases which have arisen under the treaty with Spain

Under the Spanish treaty of 1795, stipulating that free ships shall make free goods, the want of such a

sea-letter or passport, or such certificates as are described in the seventeenth article, is not a substantive

ground of condemnation. It only authorizes capture and sending in for adjudication, and the proprietary

interest in the ship may be proved by other equivalent testimony. But if, upon the original evidence,

the cause appears extremely doubtful and suspicious, and farther proof is necessary, the grant or denial

of it rests on the same general rules which govern the discretion of prize courts in other cases. The

dominions. Ibid.

The Spanish character of the ship being ascertained, the proprietary interest of the cargo cannot be

inquired into ; unless so far as to ascertain that it does not belong to citizens of the United States, whose

property engaged in trade with the enemy is not protected by the treaty. Ibid.

The seventeenth article of the Spanish treaty of 1795, so far as it purports to give any effect to pass-

ports, is imperfect and inoperative, in consequence of the omission to annex the form of passport to the

treaty. The Amiable Isabella, 6 Wheat. 1; 5 Cond. Rep. 1.

By the Spanish treaty of 1795, free ships make free goods; but the form of the passport, by which

the freedom of the ship was to have been conclusively established, never having been duly annexed to

the treaty, the proprietary interest of the ship is to be proved according to the ordinary rules of the prize

court; and if thus shown to be Spanish, will protect the cargo on board, to whomsoever the latter may

belong. Ibid.

TREATY WITH SPAIN. 1795.

Southern boundary line established.
Commissioners to run the boundary line.
Mississippi to be the western boundary, and the navigation thereof secured.

declared and agreed as follows, to wit. The southern boundary of the United States, which divides their territory from the Spanish colonies of East and West Florida, shall be designated by a line beginning on the river Missisippi, at the northernmost part of the thirty-first degree of latitude north of the equator, which from thence shall be drawn due east to the middle of the river Apalachicola, or Catahouche, thence along the middle thereof to its junction with the Flint: thence straight to the head of St. Mary's river, and thence down the middle thereof to the Atlantic ocean. And it is agreed, that if there should be any troops, garrisons, or settlements of either party, in the territory of the other, according to the above-mentioned boundaries, they shall be withdrawn from the said territory within the term of six months after the ratification of this treaty, or sooner if it be possible; and that they shall be permitted to take with them all the goods and effects which they possess.
ARTICLE III.
In order to carry the preceding article into effect, one commissioner and one surveyor shall be appointed by each of the contracting parties, who shall meet at the Natchez, on the left side of the river Missisippi, before the expiration of six months from the ratification of this convention, and they shall proceed to run and mark this boundary according to the stipulations of the said article. They shall make plats and keep journals of their proceedings, which shall be considered as part of this convention, and shall have the same force as if they were inserted therein. And if on any account it should be found necessary that the said commissioners and surveyors should be accompanied by guards, they shall be furnished in equal proportions by the commanding officer of his Majesty's troops in the two Floridas, and the commanding officer of the troops of the United States in their southwestern territory, who shall act by common consent, and amicably, as well with respect to this point as to the furnishing of provisions and instruments, and making every other arrangement which may be necessary or useful for the execution of this article. ARTICLE IV.
It is likewise agreed that the western boundary of the United States which separates them from the Spanish colony of Louissiana, is in the middle of the channel or bed of the river Missisippi, from the northern boundary of the said states to the completion of the thirty-first degree of latitude north of the equator. And his Catholic Majesty has likewise agreed that the navigation of the said river, in its whole breadth from its source to the ocean, shall be free only to bis subjects and the citizens of the United States, unless he should extend this privilege to the subjects of other powers by special convention.

How each nation shall conduct with Indians in their respective territories.

ARTICLE V. The two high contracting parties shall, by all the means in their power, maintain peace and harmony among the several Indian nations who inhabit the country adjacent to the lines and rivers, which, by the preceding articles, form the boundaries of the two Floridas. And the better to obtain this effect, both parties oblige themselves expressly to restrain by force all hostilities on the part of the Indian nations living within their boundary : so that Spain will not suffer her Indians to attack the citizens of the United States, nor the Indians inhabiting their territory; nor will the United States permit these last-mentioned Indians to commence hostilities against the subjects of his Catholic Majesty or his Indians, in any manner whatever. And whereas several treaties of friendship exist between the two contracting parties and the said nations of Indians, it is hereby agreed that

M. Catolica ha convenido igualmente en que la navegacion de dicho Rio en toda su extension desde su ovilla hasta el oceano, sera libre solo a. sus subditos y a los ciudadanos de los Estados Unidos, a menos que por algun tratado particular haga extensiva esta libertad a subditos de sotras potencias.

M. Catolica 6 a sus Indios de manera alguna. Existiendo varies tratados de amistad entre las expresadas naciones y las dos potencias, se ha convenido en no hacer en lo venidero alianza
