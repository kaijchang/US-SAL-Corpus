ADVERTISEMENT

In publishing the following Laws, the same plan has been adopted that was prescribed in the joint resolution of Congress of March 3, 1845, authorizing a subscription to the edition of all the Laws of the United States just published by us. As we procured a careful collation with the records at Washington, by an experienced reader, and have scrupulously followed the original, we feel justified in saying that the public can safely rely on this publication. Any seeming errors, therefore, must be attributed to the Rolls, and not to us. Where any thing absolutely necessary to the sense is omitted in the Rolls, our plan is to insert it in the text, enclosed in brackets.

States, a greater number of passengers than in proportion of one to every
two tons of such vessel, not- including children under the age of one year in the computation, and computing two children over one and under eight
years of age as one passenger. That the spaces appropriated for the use of such passengers, and which shall not be occupied by stores or other
goods, not the personal baggage of such passengers, shall be in the following proportions, viz: On the main and poop decks or platforms,
and in the deck houses, if there be any, one passenger for each sixteen clear superficial feet of deck, if the height or distance between the decks

United States, shall, for each passenger taken on board beyond the limit

aforesaid, or the space aforesaid, be fined in the sum of fifty dollars, and

may also be .imprisoned, at the discretion of the judge before whom the

penalty shall be recovered, not exceeding six months; but should it be

necessary, for the safety or convenience of the vessel, that any portion of

her cargo, or any other' articles or article, should be placed on, or stored

in, any of the decks, cabins, or other places appropriated to the use of

Lockers or in- passengers, the same may be placed in lockers or enclosures prepared for closures allowed. the purpose, on an exterior surface impervious to the wave, capable of

being cleansed in like manner as the decks or platforms of the vessel.

In no case, however, shall the places thus provided be deemed to be a

part of the space allowable for the use of passengers, but the same shall

be deducted therefrom, and in all cases where prepared or used, the

upper surface of said lockers on enclosed spaces, shall be deemed and

taken to be the deck or platform from which measurement shall be made

the spaces appropriated to passengers, and separate therefrom by an ap-

propriate partition, and furnished as its purposes require, may be pre-

pared, and, when used, may be included in the space allowable for pas-

sengers, but the same shall not occupy more than one hundred superficial

Space in certain feet of deck or platform : Provided, That on board two-deck ships, where two-deck vessels. the height between the decks is seven and one half feet or more, fourteen

clear superficial feet of deck shall be the proportion required for each passenger.

Berths.

more than two tiers of berths, and the interval, between the lowest part thereof and the deck or platform beneath, shall not be less than nine

inches, and the berths shall be well constructed, parallel with the sides of

the vessel, and separated from each other by partitions, as berths ordi-

narily are separated, and shall be at least six feet in length, and at least

two feet in width, and each berth shall be occupied by no more than one

passenger; but double berths of twice the above width may be con-

forward portion of the apartment or apartments, and one of them shall have an exhausting cap to carry off the foul air, and the other a receiving cap to carry down the fresh air; which said ventilators shall have a
capacity proportioned to the size of the apartment or apartments to be purified, namely: if the apartment or apartments will lawfully authorize the reception of two hundred such passengers, the capacity of such venti-
lators shall each be equal to a tube of twelve inches diameter in the clear, and in proportion for larger or smaller apartments; and all said ventila-
tors shall rise at least four feet six inches above the upper deck of any such vessel, and be of the most approved form and construction; but if it shall appear, from the report, to be made and approved, as hereinafter provided, that such vessel is equally well ventilated by any other means, such other means of ventilation shall be deemed and held to be a com-

leaving the last port whence such vessel shall sail, well secured under deck, for each passenger, at least twenty pounds of good navy bread, fifteen
pounds of rice, fifteen pounds of oatmeal, ten pounds of wheat flour, fifteen pounds of peas and beans, twenty pounds of potatoes, one pint of vinegar, sixty gallons of fresh water, ten pounds of salted pork, and ten pounds of salt beef, free of bone, all to be of good quality ; but at places where either rice, oatmeal, wheat flour, or peas and beans cannot be procured, of good quality and on reasonable terms, the quantity of either or any of the other last named articles may be increased and substituted therefor; and, in
case potatoes cannot be procured on reasonable terms, one pound of either
of said articles may be substituted in lieu of five pounds of potatoes; and the captains of such vessels shall deliver to each passenger at least one tenth part of the aforesaid provisions weekly, commencing on the day of sailing, and at least three quarts of water daily; and if the passengers on board of any such vessel in which the provisions and water herein
required shall not have been provided as aforesaid, shall, at any time, be
put on short allowance during any voyage, the master or owner of any
such vessel shall pay to each and every passenger who shall have been put on short allowance, the sum of three dollars for each and every day
they may have been put on short allowance, to be recovered in the cir-
cuit or district court of the United States ; and it shall be the duty of the captain or master of every such ship or vessel to cause the food and pro-
visions of all the passengers to be well and properly cooked daily, and to be served out and distributed to them at regular and stated hours, by
messes, or in such other manner as shall be deemed best and most con-

so employed, is hereby authorized to maintain good discipline and such

habits of cleanliness among such passengers as will tend to the preserva-

tion and promotion of health; and to that end he shall cause such regu-

lations as he may adopt for this purpose to be posted up, before sailing,

on board such vessel, in a place accessible to such passengers,' and shall

keep the same so posted up during the voyage; and it is hereby made

the duty of said captain to cause the apartments occupied by such pas-

sengers to be kept at all times in a clean, healthy state; and the owners

of every such vessel so employed, are required to construct the decks and

all parts of said apartment so that it can be thoroughly cleansed; and

they shall also provide a safe, convenient privy or water-closet for the

exclusive use of every one hundred such passengers. And when the

weather is such that said passengers cannot be mustered on deck with

their bedding, it shall be the duty of the captain of every such vessel to

cause the deck, occupied by such passengers, to be cleansed with chloride

of lime, or some other equally efficient disinfecting agent, and also at

such other times as said captain may deem necessary.

Sec . 8. And be it further enacted, That the master and owner or

owners of any such vessel so employed, which shall not be provided with

the house or houses over the passage-ways, as prescribed in the third

section of this chapter, or with ventilators, as prescribed in the fourth

section of this chapter, or with the cambooses or cooking ranges, with the

houses over them, as prescribed in the fifth section of this chapter, shall

severally forfeit and pay to the United States the sum of two hundred

dollars for each and every violation of, or neglect to conform to, the pro-

visions of each of said sections, and fifty dollars for each and every

neglect or violation of any of the provisions of the seventh section of this

chapter, to be recovered by suit in any circuit or district court of the

United States within the jurisdiction of which the said vessel may arrive,

jurisdiction of such courts, wherever the owner or owners, or captain of

such vessel may be found.

Sec . 9. And be it further enacted, That the collector of the customs

at any port of the United States, at which any vessel so employed shall

arrive, or from which any such vessel shall be about to depart, shall ap-

point and direct one or more of the inspectors of the customs for such

port, to examine such vessel, and report in writing to such collector,

whether the requirements of law have been complied with in respect to

such vessel; and if such report shall state such compliance, and shall be

approved by such collector, it shall be deemed and held as prima facie

evidence thereof.

Jan. 18,1855. BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

A PROCLAMATION.

Title.

Wher eas a convention between the United States of America and

the Kingdom of Hanover was concluded and signed by their respective

plenipotentiaries, in London, on the eighteenth day of January, eighteen

hundred and fifty-five; which convention, being in the English and

German languages, is, word for word, as follows: --

Preamble as to Convention for the mutual extradi-

extradition of tion of fugitives from justice, in

criminals.

certain cases, concluded between

the government of the United

States on the one part, and the

kingdom of Hanover on the othei'

part.

Vertrag zwischen den Vereinigten
Staaten einerseits und dem Kbnigreich Hannover andererseits wegen der in gewissen Fallen zu gewahrenden gegenseitigen Aus-
lieferung der vor der Justiz fliichtigen Verbrecher.

Neither country to deliver up its own subjects or citizens.

The United States of America and his Majesty the King of Hanover, actuated by an equal desire to
further the administration of justice, and to prevent the commission of' crime in their respective countries, taking into consideration that the increased means of communication between Europe and America facilitate the escape of offenders, and that,
consequently, provision ought to be
made in order that the ends of justice shall not be defeated, have deter-
mined to conclude an arrangement destined to regulate the course to be observed, in all cases, with refer-
ence to the extradition of such individuals as, having committed any
of the offences hereafter enumerated in one country, shall have taken
refuge within the territories of the other. The constitution and laws
of Hanover, however, not allowing the Hanoverian government to surrender their own subjects for trial
before a foreign court of justice, a strict reciprocity requires that the government of the United States
shall be held equally free from any obligation to surrender citizens of
the United States.

Die Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika und Seine Majestat der Kbnig von Hannover, von dem gleichen Wunsche beseelt, in den beiderseitigen Staaten die Verwaltung der
Rechtspflege und die Verhiitung von Verbrechen zu befbrdern, in Erwagung dass die verbesserten
Verkehrsmittel zwischen Europa und Amerika das Entkommen von Verbrechern erleichtern, und dass
es daher einer gemeinschaftlichen Vorsorge bedarf, damit nicht die
Zwecke der Gerechtigkeit vereitelt werden, dann in Berucksichtigung der Verfassung und Ge-
setzgebung Hannovers, welche es
der Hannoverschen Regierung nicht gestatten, ihre eignen Unterthanen
zur Aburtheilung vor fremden Ge-
richtshbfen auszuliefern, sowie in Berucksichtigung des Grundsatzes genauer Reciprocitat, nach welchem auch die Regierung der Vereinigten
Staaten eine Verbindlichkeit zur Auslieferung von Biirgern der Ver-
einigten Staaten, gegeniiber der Hannoverschen Regierung, nicht
eingehen soil, haben sich entschlossen, eine Uebereinkunft abzuschliessen, welche in alien Fallen zur Richtschnur des Verfahrens hinsichtlich der Auslieferung solcher
Personen dienen soli, welche in dem einen Lande gewisse hiernach
namentlich aufgezahlte Verbrechen
veriibt, und sich sodann in das
Gebiet des andern Staates gefliichtet
haben.

Reclamation of deserters from vessels.

Consuls-general, consuls, and viceconsuls may, in so far as the extradition of deserters from merchant vessels or ships-of-wai' shall have been stipulated by treaty, request the assistance of the local authorities for the arrest, detention, and imprisonment of deserters from vessels of the United States. To this end they shall apply to the competent functionaries, and claim said deserters, in writing, proving by the register of the vessel, the list of the crew, or by any other authentic document, that the persons claimed belonged to the crew.

The reclamation being thus supported, the local functionaries shall exercise what authority they possess, in order to cause the deserters to be delivered up.

These deserters, being arrested, shall be placed at the disposal of said consuls, and may be confined in the public prisons at the request, and at the expense of those who claim them, in order that they may
be taken to the vessels to which they belong, or to other vessels of
the same nation. But if they are not sent back within four months from the day of their arrest, they
shall be set at liberty, and shall
not again be arrested for the same cause.

It is understood, however, that if the deserter be found to have committed any crime, offence, or contravention, his extradition may be delayed until the court having cog-
nizance of the matter shall have pronounced its sentence, and the same has been carried into execution.

Artik el X. 
De Consuls Generaal, Consuls en Vice-Consuls, kunnen, voor zoover de uitlevering van deserteurs van koopvaardij of vorlogschepen bij tractaat is bedongen, de hulp der plaatselijke overheid inroepen tot het aanhouden, gevangen nemen en in verzekerde bewaring houden van deserteurs van schepen der Vereenigde Staten ; zij wenden zich te
dien einde tot de bevoegde ambtenaren en eischen de gezegde deserteurs schriftelijk op, mits uit de scheepsregisters, monsterrollen of ieder ander authentiek stuk, bewijzende, dat de opgeeischte personen behoord hebben tot de manschap.
Wanneer de opeisching op deze wijze is gestaafd, is deplaatselijke overheid gehouden, gebruik te maken van al de middelen in hare magt, ten einde de uitlevering der deserteurs geschieSe.
Na hunne aanhouding worden deze deserteurs gesteld ter beschikking van de gezegde Consuls, en kunnen op aanvrage en op kosten van degenen die hen opeischen, worden opgesloten in de openbare gevangenissen, ten einde te worden gezonden naar de schepen, waartoe zij behooren, of naar andere schepen van dezelfde natie. Indien zij echter binnen vier maanden na den dag hunner aanhouding niet terug gezonden zijn, worden zij in vrijheid gesteld, en kunnen zij om dezelfde reden niet wederom in hechtenis worden genomen.
Het staat echter vast dat, indien de deserteur bevonden werd eenige misdaad, wanbedrijf of overtreding te hebben gepleegd, zijne uitlevering kan worden uitgesteld tot dat de betrokken regtbank uitspraak hebbe gedaan en deze ten uitvoer
gelegd zij.

The consuls-general, consuls, and vice-consuls have, in that capacity, in so far as the laws of the United States of America allow it, the right to be named arbiters in the differences which may arise between the masters and the crew's of the vessels belonging to the United States, and this without the interference of the local authorities, unless the conduct of the crew or of the captain should have been such as to disturb the order and tranquillity of the country, or that the consuls-general, consuls, or vice-consuls, should request the assistance of the said authorities, in order to carry out their decisions or to maintain their authority.
It is understood, however, that this decision or special arbitrament is not to deprive, on their return, the parties in litigation of the right of appeal to the judiciary authorities of their own country.

De Consuls Generaal, Consuls en Arbitration by Vice-Consuls hebben als zoodanig, consuls. voor zoover de wetgeving der Ver-

Where as there is reason to believe that a military expedition is about to be fitted out in the United States, for the purpose of invading the Mexican Republic, with which this country is at peace; and whereas there is a reason to

apprehend that a portion of the people of this country, regardless of their duties as good citizens are concerned in, or may be seduced to take part in the

same. And whereas such enterprises tend to degrade the character of the United States, in the opinion of the civilized world, and are expressly prohibited by law:
Now, therefore, I have issued this my Proclamation, warning all person? who shall connect themselves with any such enterprise, in violation of the laws and national obligations of the United States, that they will thereby subject themselves to the heavy penalties denounced against such offences; that if they should be captured within the jurisdiction of the Mexican authorities, they must expect to be tried and punished according to the laws of Mexico, and will have no right to claim the interposition of this government, in their behalf.
I therefore exhort all well-disposed citizens who have at heart the reputation of their country, and are animated With a just regal'd for its laws, its peace, and its welfare, to discountenance and by all lawful means prevent any such enterprise ; and I call upon every officer of this Government, civil or military, to be vigilant in arresting for trial and punishment every such offender.

Officers, to prevent it and arrest offenders.

Whe rea s information has been received that sundry persons, citizens of the United States, and others residing therein, are engaged in organizing and fitting out a military expedition for the invasion of the island of Cuba;
And whereas the said undertaking is contrary to the spirit and express stipulations of treaties between the United States and Spain, derogatory to the character of this nation, and in violation of the obvious duties and obligations of faithful and patriotic citizens;

press act of Congress; Now, therefore, in virtue of the authority vested by the Constitution in the
President of the United States, I do issue this proclamation to warn all persons that the General Government claims it as a right and duty to interpose itself for the honor of its flag, the rights of its citizens, the national security, and the preservation of the public tranquillity, from whatever quarter menaced; and it will not fail to prosecute with due energy all those who, unmindful of their own and their country's fame, presume thus to disregard the laws of the land and our
treaty obligations. I earnestly exhort all good citizens to discountenance and prevent any move-

each by article 1 of a convention between the United States and Great Britain, signed at London on the 20th day of October, 1818; and being
also desirous to regulate the commerce and navigation between their respective territories and people, and more especially between her Majesty's possessions in North America and the United States, in such manner as to render the same reciprocally beneficial and satisfactory, have, respectively, named plenipotentiaries to confer and agree thereupon--that is to say, the President of the United States of America, William L. Marcy, Secretary of State of the United States, and her Majesty the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, James, Earl of Elgin
and Kincardine, Lord Bruce and Elgin, a peer of the United Kingdom, Knight of the most ancient and most noble Ordei' of the Thistle, and governor-general in and over all her Britannic Majesty's provinces on the continent of North America, and in and over the island of Prince Edward--who, after having communicated to each other their respective

articles: -- Artic le 1. It is agreed by the high contracting parties that, in addi-
tion to the liberty secured to the United States fishermen by the abovementioned convention of October 20, 1818, of taking, curing, and drying

stricted to any distance from the shore, with permission to land upon the coasts and shores of those colonies and the islands thereof, and also upon the Magdalen Islands, for the purpose of drying their nets and curing their fish : provided that, in so doing, they do not interfere with the rights

Hereafter, whenever citizens of the United States come to Lew Chew,

they shall be treated with great courtesy and friendship. Whatever

articles these people ask for, whether from the officers or people, which

the country can furnish, shall be sold to them; nor shall the authorities

interpose any prohibitory regulations to the people selling, and whatever

either party may wish to buy shall be exchanged at reasonable prices.

Whenever ships of the United States shall come into any harbor in

Lew Chew they shall be supplied with wood and water at reasonable

prices; but if they wish to get other articles, they shall be purchasable

only at Napa.

islands under the jurisdiction of the royal government of Lew Chew, the

local authorities shall dispatch persons to assist in saving life and prop-

erty, and preserve what can be brought ashore till the ships of that

nation shall come to take away all that may have been saved; and the

expenses incurred in rescuing these unfortunate persons shall be refunded by the nation they belong to.

Whenever persons from ships of the United States come ashore in

Lew Chew, they shall be at liberty to ramble where they please without hindrance or having officials sent to follow them, or to spy what they do;

but if they violently go into houses, or trifle with women, or force people

to sell them things, or do other such like illegal acts, they shall be arrested

by the local officers, but not maltreated, and shall be reported to the cap-

tain of the ship to which they belong for punishment by him.

At Tumai is a burial-ground for the citizens of the United States, where their graves and tombs shall not be molested.

The government of Lew Chew shall appoint skillful pilots, who shall

coming towards Napa, they shall go out in good boats beyond the reefs to

conduct her in to a secure anchorage, for which service the captain shall

pay the pilot five dollars, and the same for going out of the harbor beyond

the reefs. Whenever ships anchor at Napa, the officers shall furnish them with

over twenty-one years of age, eighty acres of land for his or their sepa-

rate use ; and he may, at his discretion, as fast as the occupants become

capable of transacting their own affairs, issue patents therefor to such

occupants, with such restrictions of the power of alienation as he may see

fit to impose. And he may also, at his discretion, make rules and regula-

abandonment by them. And he may also assign other lands in exchange for

mineral lands, if any such are found in the tracts herein set apart. And

Whe reas a treaty was made and concluded at Nebraska City, in the Territory of Nebraska, on the ninth day of December, one thousand eight hundred and fifty-four, between the United States of America and the
chiefs and headmen of the confederate tribes of the Ottoe and Missouria Indians, which treaty is in the words following, to wit: --
Article of agreement and convention made and concluded at Nebraska City, in the Territory of Nebraska, on the ninth day of December, one thousand eight hundred and fifty-four, between the United States of America, by George Hepner, United States Indian agent, duly authorized thereto, and the chiefs and headmen of the confederate tribes of the Ottoe and Missouria Indians, to be taken and considered as a supplement to the treaty made between the United States and said confederate tribes, on the fifteenth day of March, one thousand eight hundred and fifty-four.
Whereas, by the first article of the treaty in the caption mentioned, it
is stipulated that the confederate tribes of Ottoe and Missouria Indians cede to the United States all their country west of the Missouri River, excepting a strip of land on the waters of the Big Blue River, ten miles in width, and bounded as follows: commencing at a point in the middle of the main branch of the Big Blue River, in a west or southwest direction from old Fort Kearney, at a place called by the Indians the " Islands ; " thence west to the western boundary of the country hereby ceded ; thence in a northerly course with said western boundary ten miles ; thence east to a point due north of the starting-point, and ten miles therefrom; thence to the place of beginning.
And whereas, upon exploration of said reservation by the said confederate tribes, it was found that they had been mistaken as to the location thereof, much the larger portion, or nearly the entirety of it, being to the west of the Big Blue River, and without sufficiency of timber, and they being dissatisfied therewith, and the United States being desirous of re-
moving all cause of complaint, this article is entered into. Artic le . It is agreed and stipulated, between the United States and
the said confederate tribes of Ottoe and Missouria Indians, that the initial point of their reservation, in lieu of that stated in the treaty, in the caption hereof mentioned, shall be a point five miles due east thereof, thence west twenty-five miles, thence north ten miles, thence east to a point due
north of the starting-point, and ten miles therefrom, thence to the place of beginning; and the country embraced within said boundaries shall be
taken and considered as the reservation and home of said confederate tribes, in lieu of that provided for them and described in the first article of said treaty

CONVENTION WITH HANOVER. Jan . 18, 1855.

Jan. 18,1855. BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

A PROCLAMATION.

Title.

Wher eas a convention between the United States of America and

the Kingdom of Hanover was concluded and signed by their respective

plenipotentiaries, in London, on the eighteenth day of January, eighteen

hundred and fifty-five; which convention, being in the English and

German languages, is, word for word, as follows: --

Preamble as to Convention for the mutual extradi-

extradition of tion of fugitives from justice, in

criminals.

certain cases, concluded between

the government of the United

States on the one part, and the

kingdom of Hanover on the othei'

part.

Vertrag zwischen den Vereinigten
Staaten einerseits und dem Kbnigreich Hannover andererseits wegen der in gewissen Fallen zu gewahrenden gegenseitigen Aus-
lieferung der vor der Justiz fliichtigen Verbrecher.

Neither country to deliver up its own subjects or citizens.

The United States of America and his Majesty the King of Hanover, actuated by an equal desire to
further the administration of justice, and to prevent the commission of' crime in their respective countries, taking into consideration that the increased means of communication between Europe and America facilitate the escape of offenders, and that,
consequently, provision ought to be
made in order that the ends of justice shall not be defeated, have deter-
mined to conclude an arrangement destined to regulate the course to be observed, in all cases, with refer-
ence to the extradition of such individuals as, having committed any
of the offences hereafter enumerated in one country, shall have taken
refuge within the territories of the other. The constitution and laws
of Hanover, however, not allowing the Hanoverian government to surrender their own subjects for trial
before a foreign court of justice, a strict reciprocity requires that the government of the United States
shall be held equally free from any obligation to surrender citizens of
the United States.

Die Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika und Seine Majestat der Kbnig von Hannover, von dem gleichen Wunsche beseelt, in den beiderseitigen Staaten die Verwaltung der
Rechtspflege und die Verhiitung von Verbrechen zu befbrdern, in Erwagung dass die verbesserten
Verkehrsmittel zwischen Europa und Amerika das Entkommen von Verbrechern erleichtern, und dass
es daher einer gemeinschaftlichen Vorsorge bedarf, damit nicht die
Zwecke der Gerechtigkeit vereitelt werden, dann in Berucksichtigung der Verfassung und Ge-
setzgebung Hannovers, welche es
der Hannoverschen Regierung nicht gestatten, ihre eignen Unterthanen
zur Aburtheilung vor fremden Ge-
richtshbfen auszuliefern, sowie in Berucksichtigung des Grundsatzes genauer Reciprocitat, nach welchem auch die Regierung der Vereinigten
Staaten eine Verbindlichkeit zur Auslieferung von Biirgern der Ver-
einigten Staaten, gegeniiber der Hannoverschen Regierung, nicht
eingehen soil, haben sich entschlossen, eine Uebereinkunft abzuschliessen, welche in alien Fallen zur Richtschnur des Verfahrens hinsichtlich der Auslieferung solcher
Personen dienen soli, welche in dem einen Lande gewisse hiernach
namentlich aufgezahlte Verbrechen
veriibt, und sich sodann in das

Reclamation of deserters from vessels.

Consuls-general, consuls, and viceconsuls may, in so far as the extradition of deserters from merchant vessels or ships-of-wai' shall have been stipulated by treaty, request the assistance of the local authorities for the arrest, detention, and imprisonment of deserters from vessels of the United States. To this end they shall apply to the competent functionaries, and claim said deserters, in writing, proving by the register of the vessel, the list of the crew, or by any other authentic document, that the persons claimed belonged to the crew.

The reclamation being thus supported, the local functionaries shall exercise what authority they possess, in order to cause the deserters to be delivered up.

These deserters, being arrested, shall be placed at the disposal of said consuls, and may be confined in the public prisons at the request, and at the expense of those who claim them, in order that they may
be taken to the vessels to which they belong, or to other vessels of
the same nation. But if they are not sent back within four months from the day of their arrest, they
shall be set at liberty, and shall
not again be arrested for the same cause.

It is understood, however, that if the deserter be found to have committed any crime, offence, or contravention, his extradition may be delayed until the court having cog-
nizance of the matter shall have pronounced its sentence, and the same has been carried into execution.

It is understood, however, that this decision or special arbitrament is not to deprive, on their return, the parties in litigation of the right of appeal to the judiciary authorities of their own country.

1. Respecting an apprehended Invasion of Mexico.

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,

A PROCLAMATION.

Where as there is reason to believe that a military expedition is about to be fitted out in the United States, for the purpose of invading the Mexican Republic, with which this country is at peace; and whereas there is a reason to

apprehend that a portion of the people of this country, regardless of their duties as good citizens are concerned in, or may be seduced to take part in the

same. And whereas such enterprises tend to degrade the character of the United States, in the opinion of the civilized world, and are expressly prohibited by law:
Now, therefore, I have issued this my Proclamation, warning all person? who shall connect themselves with any such enterprise, in violation of the laws and national obligations of the United States, that they will thereby subject themselves to the heavy penalties denounced against such offences; that if they should be captured within the jurisdiction of the Mexican authorities, they must expect to be tried and punished according to the laws of Mexico, and will have no right to claim the interposition of this government, in their behalf.
I therefore exhort all well-disposed citizens who have at heart the reputation of their country, and are animated With a just regal'd for its laws, its peace, and its welfare, to discountenance and by all lawful means prevent any such enterprise ; and I call upon every officer of this Government, civil or military, to be vigilant in arresting for trial and punishment every such offender.

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,

A PROCLAMATION.

Preamble as to expedition fitting out against Cuba.
Warning to all engaged in such expedition.
Officers, to prevent it and arrest offenders.

Whe rea s information has been received that sundry persons, citizens of the United States, and others residing therein, are engaged in organizing and fitting out a military expedition for the invasion of the island of Cuba;
And whereas the said undertaking is contrary to the spirit and express stipulations of treaties between the United States and Spain, derogatory to the character of this nation, and in violation of the obvious duties and obligations of faithful and patriotic citizens;
And whereas it is the duty of the constituted authorities of the United States to hold and maintain the control of the great question of peace or war, and not suffer the same to be lawlessly complicated, under any pretence whatever;
And whereas, to that end, all private enterprizes of a hostile character within the United States, against any foreign power with which the United States are at peace, are forbidden, and declared to be a high misdemeanor by an ex-
press act of Congress; Now, therefore, in virtue of the authority vested by the Constitution in the
President of the United States, I do issue this proclamation to warn all persons that the General Government claims it as a right and duty to interpose itself for the honor of its flag, the rights of its citizens, the national security, and the preservation of the public tranquillity, from whatever quarter menaced; and it will not fail to prosecute with due energy all those who, unmindful of their own and their country's fame, presume thus to disregard the laws of the land and our
treaty obligations. I earnestly exhort all good citizens to discountenance and prevent any move-
ment in conflict with law and national faith; especially charging the several district-attorneys, collectors, and other officers of the United States, civil or military, having lawful power in the premises, to exert the same for the purpose of maintaining the authority and preserving the peace of the United States.
