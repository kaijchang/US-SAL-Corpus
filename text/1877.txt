CHAP. 104.--An act to provide for compensation to the owners of certain lands ceded by the United States to Great Britain in and by the treaty of Washington of July 9, 1842

March 3, 1877.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, Whereas the United States in and by the treaty of Washington of July ninth eighteen hundred and forty two by adopting a conventional line, "from the monument at the source of the river Saint Croix, running north, following the exploring
line run and marked by the surveyors of the two governments in the years eighteen hundred and seventeen and eighteen hundred and eighteen" instead of a true line did cede to the British crown a strip of land commencing at an angle at said monument and increasing to nearly one mile in width at the river Saint John, certain portions of which, amounting to ten thousand seven hundred and eighteen acres and one hundred and thirty seven square rods, had been granted to citizens of the United States by the States of Maine and Massachusetts while the same were in the lines of the United States, and for which the United States received compensation in equivalents and concessions from the British Crown and whereas the United States have made compensation to the States of Maine and Massachusetts for so much of said territory as was owned by them, respectively, and all citizens owning lands on the rest of said exploring-line, which vested in British subjects by operation of the treaty aforesaid under the act of July twelfth eighteen hundred and sixty two,
and other acts, and have hitherto failed to make compensation to those citizens owning lands upon the strip and tract east of said exploring line, which passed either to British subjects or the British Crown by virtue of said exploring-line being adopted as the treaty line between the two countries at that point, whereby said citizens became entitled to compensation for said lands so appropriated to public use:
To the end, therefore, that compensation may now be made by the United States to the parties entitled thereto,
Be it enacted, by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the Secretary of the Treasury be, and hereby is; authorized and directed to pay to the parties entitled thereto compensation for said land taken from the State of Maine by said conventional line, and included in the province of New Brunswick, not exceeding ten thousand seven hundred and eighteen acres and one hundred and thirty-seven square rods appropriated by the United States as aforesaid, its value in money at the date of said appropriation, and also for all timber cut therefrom by British subjects
during the suspension of jurisdiction by the respective governments preceding said treaty: Provided, That the whole amount of compensation so made for said land and timber shall not exceed an average compensation of three dollars per acre, and that the same shall be distributed and applied in proportion to the relative value of said lands when

Sec . 3. That one-half of the tax levied by this act upon real and personal property shall become due and payable on the first day of November, eighteen hundred and seventy-seven, and the other one-half of such tax shall become due and payable on the first day of May, eighteen hundred and seventy-eight; and in every case where the tax levied by this act shall be paid in installments as herein authorized, each of said payments shall be deemed to have been made on the several funds and for the different purposes indicated in the second section of this act; and an equal pro-rata proportion of the payments so made shall be carried to the credit of the respective funds.
Sec . 4.

of said tax-collector; and that if the taxes due together with the penalties and costs that may have accrued thereon, shall not be paid prior to the day named for sale, the property will be sold by the said collector at public auction at office of said collector in the city of Washington, on the second Tuesday of August following, and each day thereafter until all is sold, at a fixed hour, between the hours of ten o'clock in the forenoon, and four o'clock in the afternoon of said days to the highest bidder or bidders.

No sale shall be made, unless by express order of the court, for an amount less than the aggregate of said taxes penalties, costs, and interest. Any surplus received from said sale over said aggregate and the costs of the court, including the commission of the trustee, shall be paid to the person in equity entitled to receive it; and, on confirmation of the sale, the court

A PROCLAMATION.

From year to year we have been accustomed to pause in our daily pursuits, and set apart a time to offer our thanks to Almighty God for

the special blessings He has vouchsafed to us, with our prayers for a continuance thereof.

We have at this time equal reason to be thankful for His continued pro-

tection,andfor themany material blessings whichHisbountyhas bestowed. In addition to these favors accorded to us as individuals, we have es-
pecial occasion to express our hearty thanks to Almighty God that by His providence and guidance our Government, established a century ago, has been enabled to fulfil the purpose of its founders in offering an asylum to the people of every race, securing civil and religious liberty

to all within its borders, and meting out to every individual alike justice and equality before the law.

It is moreover especially our duty to offer our humble prayers to the Father of all mercies for a continuance of His Divine favor to us as a nation and as individuals.

By reason of all these considerations, I, Ulys ses S. Gran t , President of the United States, do recommend to the people of the United States to devote the 30th day of November next, to the expression of their thanks and prayers to Almighty God, and, laying aside their daily avocations and all secular occupations, to assemble in their respective places of worship, and observe such day as a day of Thanksgiving and rest.
In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.

Done at the city of Washington this twenty-sixth day of October, in

the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and seventy[sea l .J six, and of the Independence of the United States of America

A PROCLAMATION.
The completed circle of summer and winter, seed-time and harvest, has brought us to the accustomed season at which a religious people celebrates with praise and thanksgiving the enduring mercy of Almighty God. This devout and public confession of the constant dependence of man upon the Divine favor for all the good gifts of life and health, and peace and happiness, so early in our history made the habit of our people, finds in the survey of the past year new grounds for its joyful and grateful manifestation.
In all the blessings which depend upon benignant seasons this has indeed been a memorable year. Over the wide territory of our country, with all its diversity of soil and climate and products, the earth has yielded a bountiful return to the labor of the husbandman. The health of the people has been blighted by no prevalent or wide-spread diseases. No great disasters of shipwreck upon our coasts, or to our commerce on the seas, have brought loss and hardship to merchants or mariners, and clouded the happiness of the community with sympathetic sorrow.
In all that concerns our strength and peace and greatness as a nation ;

No. 4.

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

July 23,1877.

A PROCLAMATION.

Whereas it is provided in the Constitution of the United States that the United States shall protect every State in this Union, on application

of the Legislature, or of the Executive, (when the Legislature cannot be convened,) against domestic violence;
And whereas the Governor of the State of Pennsylvania has represented that domestic violence exists in said State which the authorities

of said State are unable to suppress ; And whereas the laws of the United States require that in all cases
of insurrection in any State or of obstruction to the laws thereof, whenever

in the judgment of the President it becomes necessary to use the military forces to suppress such insurrection or obstruction to the laws, he shall forthwith by proclamation command such insurgents to disperse, and retire peaceably to their respective abodes within a limited time:

Now, therefore, I, Ruther ford B. Hayes , President of the United States, do hereby admonish all good citizens of the United States, and all persons within the territory and jurisdiction of the United States, against aiding, countenancing, abetting, or taking part in such unlawful proceedings; and I do hereby warn all persons engaged in or connected

with said domestic violence and obstruction of the laws to disperse and retire peaceably to their respective abodes on or before twelve o'clock noon of the twenty-fourth day of July instant.
In testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the

seal of the United States to be affixed. Done at the city of Washington this twenty-third day of July, in the

year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and seventy[seal .] seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America

the one hundred and second.

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
A PROCLAMATION.
The completed circle of summer and winter, seed-time and harvest, has brought us to the accustomed season at which a religious people celebrates with praise and thanksgiving the enduring mercy of Almighty God. This devout and public confession of the constant dependence of man upon the Divine favor for all the good gifts of life and health, and peace and happiness, so early in our history made the habit of our people, finds in the survey of the past year new grounds for its joyful and grateful manifestation.
In all the blessings which depend upon benignant seasons this has indeed been a memorable year. Over the wide territory of our country, with all its diversity of soil and climate and products, the earth has yielded a bountiful return to the labor of the husbandman. The health of the people has been blighted by no prevalent or wide-spread diseases. No great disasters of shipwreck upon our coasts, or to our commerce on the seas, have brought loss and hardship to merchants or mariners, and clouded the happiness of the community with sympathetic sorrow.
In all that concerns our strength and peace and greatness as a nation ;

PROCLAMATIONS.

Appointing Thursday, November 29, 1877, Thanksgiving Day.

in all that touches the permanence and security of our government, and

the beneficent institutions on which it rests ; in all that affects the character and dispositions of our people, and tests our capacity to enjoy and uphold the equal and free condition of society, now permanent and

universal throughout the land, the experience of the last year is conspicuously marked by the protecting providence of God, and is full of

promise and hope for the coming generations. Under a sense of these infinite obligations to the great Euler of times
and seasons and events, let us humbly ascribe it to our own faults and frailties if, in any degree, that perfect concord and happiness, peace and justice, which such great mercies should diffuse through the hearts and lives of our people, do not altogether and always and everywhere prevail. Let us with one spirit and with one voice lift up praise and thanksgiving to God for his manifold goodness to our land, his manifest care for our nation.

Now, therefore, I, Ruther ford B. Hayes , President of the United States, do appoint Thursday, the twenty-ninth day of November next, as a Day of National Thanksgiving and Prayer; and I earnestly recom-

mend that, withdrawing themselves from secular cares and labors, the people of the United States do meet together on that day in their respective places of worship, there to give thanks and praise to Almighty God for his mercies, and to devoutly beseech their continuance.
In witness whereof 1 have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.

Done at the city of Washington this twenty-ninth day of October, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and seventy-

Whereas it is provided in the laws of the United States that whenever, by reason of unlawful obstructions, combinations or assemblages of persons, or rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States, it shall become impracticable, in the judgment of the President, to enforce by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings the laws of the United States within any State or Territory, it shall be lawful for the President to call forth the militia of any or all the States, and to employ such parts of the land and naval forces of the United States as he may deem necessary to enforce the faithful execution of the laws of the United States, or to suppress such rebellion, in whatever State or Territory thereof the laws of the United States may be forcibly opposed or the execution thereof forcibly obstructed;
And whereas it has been made to appear to me that by reason of unlawful combinations and assemblages of persons in arms, it has become impracticable to enforce, by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings, the laws of the United States within the Territory of New Mexico, and especially within Lincoln County therein; and that the laws of the United States have been therein forcibly opposed and the execution thereof forcibly resisted;
