Preamble.
Grant of land to H. Perrine.
When to be located, &c.
Proviso. When a patent shall issue.
How and when it shall be forfeited to the U. S.

Whereas in obedience to the Treasury circular of the sixth of September, eighteen hundred and twenty-seven, Doctor Henry Perrine, late American Consul at Campeachy, has distinguished himself by his persevering exertions to introduce tropical plants into the United States: and whereas he has demonstrated the existence of a tropical climate in southern Florida, and has shown the consequent certainty of the immediate domestication of tropical plants in tropical Florida, and the great probability of their gradual acclimation throughout all our southern and southwestern States, especially of such profitable plants as propagate themselves on the poorest soils; and whereas, if the enterprise should be successful, it will render valuable our hitherto worthless soils, by covering them with a dense population of small cultivators and family manufacturers, and will thus promote the peace, prosperity, and permanency of the Union : Therefore,
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That a township of land is hereby granted to Doctor Henry Perrine and his associates, in the southern extremity of the peninsula of East Florida, to be located in one body of six miles square, upon any portion of the public lands below twenty-six degrees north latitude.
Sec . 2. And be it further enacted, That the said tract of land shall be located within two years from this date, by said Henry Perrine, and shall be surveyed under his direction, by the surveyor of Florida, Provided, That it shall not embrace any land having sufficient quantities of naval timber to be reserved to the United States, nor any sites for maritime ports or cities.
Sec . 3. And be it further enacted, That whenever any section of land in said tract, shall be really occupied by a bona fide settler, actually engaged in the propagation or cultivation of valuable tropical plants, and upon proof thereof being made to the Commissioner of the General Land Office, a patent shall issue to the said Henry Perrine and his associates.
Sec . 4. And be itfurther enacted, That every section of land in the tract aforesaid, which shall not be occupied by an actual settler, positively engaged in the propagation or cultivation of useful tropical plants within eight years from the location of said tract, or when the adjacent territory shall be surveyed and offered for sale, shall be forfeited to the United States.

Preamble.
Grant of land to H. Perrine.
When to be located, &c.
Proviso. When a patent shall issue.
How and when it shall be forfeited to the U. S.

Whereas in obedience to the Treasury circular of the sixth of September, eighteen hundred and twenty-seven, Doctor Henry Perrine, late American Consul at Campeachy, has distinguished himself by his persevering exertions to introduce tropical plants into the United States: and whereas he has demonstrated the existence of a tropical climate in southern Florida, and has shown the consequent certainty of the immediate domestication of tropical plants in tropical Florida, and the great probability of their gradual acclimation throughout all our southern and southwestern States, especially of such profitable plants as propagate themselves on the poorest soils; and whereas, if the enterprise should be successful, it will render valuable our hitherto worthless soils, by covering them with a dense population of small cultivators and family manufacturers, and will thus promote the peace, prosperity, and permanency of the Union : Therefore,
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That a township of land is hereby granted to Doctor Henry Perrine and his associates, in the southern extremity of the peninsula of East Florida, to be located in one body of six miles square, upon any portion of the public lands below twenty-six degrees north latitude.
Sec . 2. And be it further enacted, That the said tract of land shall be located within two years from this date, by said Henry Perrine, and shall be surveyed under his direction, by the surveyor of Florida, Provided, That it shall not embrace any land having sufficient quantities of naval timber to be reserved to the United States, nor any sites for maritime ports or cities.
Sec . 3. And be it further enacted, That whenever any section of land in said tract, shall be really occupied by a bona fide settler, actually engaged in the propagation or cultivation of valuable tropical plants, and upon proof thereof being made to the Commissioner of the General Land Office, a patent shall issue to the said Henry Perrine and his associates.
Sec . 4. And be itfurther enacted, That every section of land in the tract aforesaid, which shall not be occupied by an actual settler, positively engaged in the propagation or cultivation of useful tropical plants within eight years from the location of said tract, or when the adjacent territory shall be surveyed and offered for sale, shall be forfeited to the United States.

Concluded at the city of Saganaw in Michigan, on the twenty-
third day of January eighteen hundred and thirty-eight, between the United States of America, by the undersigned commissioner, and the several bands of the Chippewa nation comprehended within the district of Saganaw.

Jan. 23, 1838.
Proclamation, July 2, 1838.

Where as the chiefs of said bands have represented, that combina-
tions of purchasers may be formed, at the sale of their lands for the pur-
pose of keeping down the price thereof, both at the public and private sales, whereby the proceeds would be greatly diminished; and whereas,
such a procedure would defeat some of the primary objects of the cession of the lands to the United States, and thereby originate difficulties to their early removal and expatriation to the country west of the Mississippi ; and whereas, full authority has been given to the undersigned, respectively, on the part of the United States, and the said bands, to conclude and settle every question connected with the sale and cession aforesaid ; Now therefore, to the end, that justice may completely ensue, the objects of both the contracting parties be attained, and peace and friendship be preserved with said tribes, it is mutually agreed as follows:

Arti cle 1st. The lands ceded by the treaty of the 14th of January
1837, shall be offered for sale, by proclamation of the President, and the sale shall be conducted in the same manner, as the laws require other lands to be sold. But it is provided, That all lands brought into market, under the authority of said treaty, shall be put up for sale by
the register and receiver of the respective land office, at five dollars per
acre, which is hereby declared to be the minimum price thereof; and if this price is not bid the sales shall be stopped: nor shall any such
lands be disposed of, either at public or private sales, for a sum less
than five dollars per acre, for, and during the term of two years from
the commencement of the sale. Should any portion of said lands remain unsold at the expiration of this time, the minimum price shall be diminished to two dollars and fifty cents per acre, at which price they shall be subject to entry until the whole quantity is sold : Provided, That if any part of said lands remain unsold at the expiration of five years from the date of the ratification of this treaty, such lands shall
fall under the provision of third article of this treaty.

Art icl e 2nd. The survey and proclamation of sale shall apply, as well to the reserves on the river Angrais, and at Rifle river, of which said Indians are to have the usufruct and occupancy for five years, as to the other lands ceded: but the sales shall be made subject to the incumbrance of such right of occupancy by the Indians, nor shall any lands thus sold be entered upon, until the full end and term of said five years, without the consent of said Indians, publickly obtained, at the office of the proper superintendent, agent or sub-agent, of such tribe or band; which consent shall be expressed by the certificate of such officer, delivered to the purchaser. And to enable such officer to act understandingly, in the discharge of this duty, a plat of the survey of such reservations, shall be furnished for the use of his office.

Arti cle 3rd. To provide against the contingency of any of said lands

remaining unsold, and to remove any objections to emigrating, on the

AS AMENDED BY THE SENATE AND ASSENTED TO BY THE SEVERAL
TRIBES, 1838.
Treaty with the New York Indians, as amended by the Senate of the United States, June 11th, 1838.

ARTICLES OF A TREATY

Jan. 15, 1838. Proclamation, April 4, 1840.

Made and concluded at Buffalo Creek in the State of New York,
the fifteenth day of January in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and thirty-eight, by Ransom H. Gillet, a commissioner on the part of the United States, and the chiefs,
head men and warriors of the several tribes of New York Indians assembled in council ivitnesseth :

Preamble. Ante, p. 342.

Wherea s , The six nations of New York Indians not long after the close of the war of the Revolution, became convinced from the rapid increase of the white settlements around, that the time was not far distant when their true interest must lead them to seek a new home, among their red brethren in the West: And whereas this subject was agitated in a general council of the Six nations as early as 1810, and resulted in sending a memorial to the President of the United States, inquiring whether the Government would consent to their leaving their habitations and their removing into the neighborhood of their western brethren, and if they could procure a home there, by gift or purchase, whether the Government would acknowledge their title to the lands so obtained in the same manner it had acknowledged it in those from whom they might receive it; and further, whether the existing treaties would, in such a case remain in full force, and their annuities be paid as heretofore : And whereas, with the approbation of the President of the United States, purchases were made by the New York Indians from the Menomonie and Winnebago Indians of certain lands at Green Bay in the Territory of Wisconsin, which after much difficulty and contention with those Indians concerning the extent of that purchase, the whole subject was finally settled by a treaty between the United States and th§ Menomonie Indians, concluded in February, 1831, to which the New York Indians gave their assent on the seventeenth day of October 1832 : And whereas, by the provisions of that treaty, five hundred thousand acres of land are secured to the New York Indians of the Six Nations and the St. Regis tribe, as a future home, on condition that they all remove to the same, within three years, or such reasonable time as the President should prescribe: And whereas, the President is satisfied that various considerations have prevented those still residing in New York from removing to Green Bay, and among other reasons, that many who were in favour of emigration, preferred to remove at once to the Indian territory, which they were fully persuaded was the only permanent and peaceable home for all the Indians. And they therefore applied to the President to take their Green Bay lands, and provide them a new home among their brethren in the Indian territory. And
(550)

whereas, the President being anxious to promote the peace, prosperity and happiness of his red children, and being determined to carry out the humane policy of the Government in removing the Indians from the east to the west of the Mississippi, within the Indian territory, by bringing them to see and feel, by his justice and liberality, that it is their true policy and for their interest to do so without delay.
Therefore, taking into consideration the foregoing premises, the following articles of a treaty are entered into between the United States of America and the several tribes of the New York Indians, the names of whose chiefs, head men and warriors are hereto subscribed, and those who may hereafter give their assent to this treaty in writing, within such time as the President shall appoint.

any article of commerce lawfully imported on account of, or in reference to the character of the vessel, whether it be of the one party or the other, in which such article was imported, it being the true intent and meaning of the contracting parties, that no distinction or difference whatever shall be made in this respect.

Favors granted by either party to other nations, to become common.

ART. IX.
If either party shall hereafter grant to any other nation any particular favor in commerce or navigation, it shall immediately become common to the other party, freely where it is freely granted to such other nation, or on yielding the same or an equivalent compensation when the grant is conditional.

Vessels, &c. to be on the same footing as those of the most favored nations.

ART. X.
Vessels of either of the high contracting parties arriving on the coasts of the other, but without the intention to enter a port, or having entered not wishing to discharge the whole, or any part of their cargoes, shall enjoy in this respect the same privileges, and be treated in the same manner as the vessels of the most favored nations.

Assistance in case of shipwreck, &c.

ART. XI. When any vessel belonging to either of the contracting parties, or to their citizens, or subjects shall be wrecked, foundered, or otherwise suffer damage on the coasts, or within the dominions of the other, there shall be given to such vessel and all persons on board every aid and protection, in like manner as is usual and customary to vessels of the nation where such shipwreck or damage happens, and such shipwrecked vessel, its merchandise, and other effects, or their proceeds, if the same shall have been sold, shall be restored to their owners, or to those entitled to receive them, upon the payment of such costs of salvage as would have been paid by national vessels in the same circumstances.

Vessels forced into port, &c., exempt from port charges, provided, &c.

ART. XII.
Sardinian merchant vessels being forced from stress of weather or other unavoidable causes to enter a port of the United States of America, and reciprocally, merchant vessels of the said States, entering the ports of his Sardinian Majesty from similar causes, shall be exempt from port charges and all other duties levied to the profit of the Government, in case the causes which have rendered such entry necessary are real and evident, provided such vessel does not engage in any commercial operation while in port, such as loading and unloading merchandize, it being understood nevertheless that the unloading, and reloading rendered necessary for the repair of the said vessel shall not be considered an act of commerce affording ground for the payment of duties, and provided also that the said vessel shall not prolong her stay in port beyond the time necessary for the repair of her damages.

Vessels attempting to enter a blockaded port, &c.

ART. XIII. Considering the remoteness of the respective countries of the two high contracting parties, and the uncertainty resulting therefrom with respect to the various events which may take place, it is agreed that a merchant vessel, belonging to either of them which may be bound to a port supposed, at the time of its departure to be blockaded, shall not however be captured, or condemned for having attempted a first time to enter said port, unless it can be proved that said vessel could, and ought to have learned during its voyage, that the blockade of the place in

n'ait lieu a cet egard.

ART. IX.

Si par la suite 1'une des parties contractantes accordait quelque faveur Speciale a d'autres nations en fait de commerce ou de navigation, cette faveur deviendra immediatement commune a. 1'autre partie qui en jouira sans charge d'aucune espece, si elle a ete accordee gratuitement a 1'autre nation, ou en accordant la meme compensation ou une autre equivalente, si la concession a ete conditionelle.

ART. X.

Les batimens de 1'tfne des deux parties contractantes abordant a quelque cote de la dependance de 1'autre, mais n'ayant pas 1'intention d'entrer au port, ou y etant entres ne voulant pas y decharger tout ou une partie de leur cargaison, jouiront des memes privileges et seront traites a cet egard de la meme maniere que les batimens des nations les plus

favorisees.

ART. XI.

S'il arrivait qu'un vaisseau appartenant a 1'une des deux parties contractantes ou bien a ses citoyens ou sujets, fit naufrage, sombrat, ou souffrit quelqu'autre dommage sur les cotes ou dans les Etats soumis a 1'autre partie, il sera accorde a ces navires et a toutes les personnes qui seront a bord le meme secours et la meme protection dont jouissent ordinairement les batimens de la nation ou le naufrage a eu lieu; et ces vaisseaux naufrages les marchandises ou autres effets qu'ils contiendront, ou leur produit, si ces objets avaient ete deja vendus, seront restitues a leurs proprietaires ou a leurs ayant droit, en payant un droit de sauvetage egal a celui qui serait paye dans le meme cas, par un vaisseau

national.

ART. XII.

Tout batiment de commerce Sarde entrant en relache forcee dans un port des Etats Unis d'Amerique; et reciproquement tout batiment de commerce des dits Etats entrant en relache forcee dans un port de sa Majeste le Roi de Sardaigne, y sera exempt de tout droit de port et de navigation, pergu ou a percevoir au profit de 1'Etat, si les causes qui ont necessite la relache sont reelles et evidentes, pourvu qu'ils ne se livrent dans le port de relache a aucune operation de commerce en chargeant ou dechargeant des marchandises; bien entendu toutefois que les dechargemens et rechargemens motives par 1'obligation de reparer le batiment ne seront point consideres comme operations de commerce donnant ouverture au payement des droits, et pourvu que le batiment ne prolonge pas son sejour dans le port au dela du terns necessaire d'apres les causes qui auront donne lieu a la relache.

ART. XIII. Vu 1'eloignement des pays respectifs des deux hautes parties contractantes et 1'incertitude qui en resulte sur les divers evenemens qui peuvent avoir lieu; il est convenu qu'un batiment marchand appartenant a 1'une d'elles qui se trouverait destine pour un port suppose bloque au moment du depart de ce batiment, ne sera cependant pas capture ou condamne pour avoir essaye une premiere fois d'entrer dans le dit port a moins qu'il ne puisse etre prouve que le dit batiment avait pu et dfi apprendre en route que 1'etat du blocus de la place en question du-

ART. XIV. · All articles of commerce the growth or manufacture of the United States of America, and the products of their fisheries, with the exception of salt, gunpowder and tobacco manufactured for use, shall be permitted to pass in transitu from the free port of Genoa through the territories of his Sardinian Majesty to any point of the inland frontier of the said territories, and vice versa, all articles of commerce coming from any one point of the Sardinian inland frontier destined for the United States, shall be permitted to pass the territories of his Sardinian Majesty to the free port of Genoa without being liable to the payment of any duty whatever levied in the name or to the profit of the Government, the local authorities or of any private establishment whatsoever, other than such as are required to meet the expenses of the necessary precautionary measures against smuggling, which precautionary measures to be observed in regard to transit to the frontier shall be the same whether the said articles of commerce are imported by the vessels of the one or of the other of the high contracting parties. But if peculiar circumstances or considerations should render the re-establishment of transit duties necessary on the said articles of commerce directed to any one point of the Sardinian frontier, the Sardinian Government, in reserving to itself the full right to establish such duty, engages to notify to the Government of the United States such determination six months before any such transit duty shall be exacted. It is also understood that all articles of commerce imported directly from the United States of America shall be taken and considered as the products of the said States, and shall be entitled equally and in like manner, with the exceptions above mentioned in the present article, to a free transit through the territories of his Sardinian Majesty.
ART. XV. The two high contracting parties reciprocally grant to each other the liberty of having each in the ports and other commercial places of the other, consuls, vice-consuls and commercial agents of their own appointment, who shall enjoy the same privileges, powers and exemptions as those of the most favoured nations. But if any of such consuls shall exercise commerce, they shall be subjected to the same laws and usages to which the private individuals of their nation, or subjects or citizens of the most favored nations are subject in the same places, in respect to their commercial transactions.

In case of citizens of one party being appointed consuls by the other.

ART. XVI.
It is especially understood that whenever either of the two contracting parties shall select for a consular agent to reside in any port or commercial place of the other party a subject or citizen of this last, such consul or agent shall continue to be regarded, notwithstanding his quality of a foreign consul, as a subject or citizen of the nation to which he belongs, and consequently shall be submitted to the laws and regulations to which natives are subjected in the place of his residence. This obligation however shall in no respect embarrass the exercise of his consular functions, or affect the inviolability of the consular archives.

The said consuls, vice-consuls and commercial agents are authorized to require the assistance of the local authorities for the search, arrest,

ART. XIV. Les articles de commerce, produits du sol ou des manufactures des Etats Unis d'Amerique, et des peches de ce pays, excepte le sel, la poudre a canon et le tabac fabrique, pourront librement passer du portfranc de Genes a travers le territoire de sa Majeste Sarde a un point quelconque de la frontiere interieure du dit territoire; et vice versa tous les articles de commerce venant par un point quelconque de la frontiere interieure Sarde, qui seront destines pour les Etats Unis, pourront traverser les Etats de sa Majeste le Roi de Sardaigne jusqu'au port-franc de Genes sans etre tenus de payer aucune espece de droit percus au nom ou au profit du Gouvernement, des autorites locales ou d'un etablissement particulier quelconque excepte ceux necessaires pour couvrir les frais qu'exigent les precautions et les mesures centre la fraude et la contrebande, et qui ne seraient pas egalement applicables au transit des memes articles importes par les batimens de 1'une ou 1'autres des hautes parties contractantes. Mais si par des circonstances et des motifs particuliers il etait juge convenable ou necessaire de retablir des droits de transit sur les articles susmentionnes diriges par un point de la frontiere Sarde, le Gouvernement de S. M. le Roi de Sardaigne s'en reserve le plein droit, s'engageant toutefois a notifier cette determination au Gouvernement des Etats Unis six mois avant son execution. Il est aussi convenu que tous les articles de commerce importes directernent des Etats Unis d'Amerique seront re^us et consideres comme des produits des dits Etats et en cette qualite, auront egalement droit au libre transit a travers les Etats de sa Majeste le Roi de Sardaigne, sauf les exceptions mentionnes dans le present article.

ART. XV. Les deux hautes parties contractantes s'accordent mutuellement le droit d'envoyer dans les ports et villes commercantes de leurs Etats respectifs des consuls, vice-consuls et agens commerciaux nommes par elles qui jouiront des memes privileges, pouvoirs et exemptions dont jouissent ceux des nations les plus favorisees; mais dans le cas ou quelques uns de ces consuls voudraient exercer le commerce, ils seront tenus de se soumettre aux memes loix et usages aux quels sont soumis dans le meme lieu par rapport a leurs transactions commerciales, les particuliers de leur nation, et les sujets des etats les plus favorises.
ART. XVI. Il est specialement entendu que lorsqu'une partie contractante choisira pour son agent consulaire pour resider dans un port ou une ville commercante de 1'autre partie un sujet ou citoyen de celle-ci, ce consul ou agent continuera a etre considere malgre sa qualite de consul etranger, comme sujet ou citoyen de la nation a laquelle il appartient et qu'il sera par consequent soumis aux loix et regiemens qui regissent les nationaux dans le lieu de sa residence, sans que cette obligation puisse cependant gener en rien 1'exercice de ses fonctions consulaires, ni porter atteinte a 1'inviolabilite des archives consulaires.

detention, and imprisonment of the deserters from the ships of war and merchant vessels of their country. For this purpose they shall apply to the competent tribunals, judges, and officers, and shall, in writing, demand said deserters, proving by the exhibition of the registers of the vessels, the rolls of the crews, or by other official documents that such individuals formed part of the crews; and this reclamation thus substantiated, the surrender shall not be refused. Such deserters when arrested shall be placed at the disposal of the said consuls, vice-consuls or commercial agents and may be confined in the public prisons at the request and cost of those who shall claim them in order to be detained until the time when they shall be restored to the vessels to which they belonged, or sent back to their own country by a vessel of the same nation or any other vessel whatsoever. But if not sent back within three months from the day of their arrest, they shall be set at liberty and shall not again be arrested for the same cause. If however the deserter should be found to have committed any crime or offence, his surrender may be delayed until the tribunal before which his case should be depending shall have pronounced its sentence and such sentence shall have been carried into execution.

Power to dispose of personal goods, &c.
In case of real estate, alien heirs allowed time to dispose of the same.

ART. XVIII.
The citizens and subjects of each of the contracting parties shall have power to dispose of their personal goods within the jurisdiction of the other, by testament, donation, or otherwise, and their representatives, being citizens or subjects of the other party, shall succeed to their said personal goods, whether by testament or ab intestato, and may take possession thereof either by themselves or by others acting for them and dispose of the same at will, paying such taxes and dues only as the inhabitants of the country wherein the said goods are, shall be subject to pay in like cases. And in case of the absence of the representatives such care shall be taken of the said goods as would be taken of the goods of a native of the same country in like case until the lawful owner may take measures for receiving them. And if a question should arise among several claimants as to which of them said goods belong, the same shall finally be decided by the laws and judges of the land wherein the said goods are. And where on the death of any person holding real estate within the territories of one of the contracting parties such real estate would by the laws of the land descend on a citizen or subject of the other party who by reason of alienage may be incapable of holding it, he shall be allowed a reasonable time to sell such real estate, and to withdraw and export the proceeds without molestation and without paying to the profit of the respective Governments any other dues, taxes or charges than those to which the inhabitants of the country wherein said real estate is situated shall be subject to pay in like cases.

Duration of the treaty.

ART. XIX.
The present treaty shall continue in force for ten years counting from the day of the exchange of the ratifications, and if, twelve months before the expiration of that period, neither of the high contracting parties shall have announced to the other by an official notification its intention to arrest the operation of the said treaty, it shall remain obligatory one year beyond that time, and so on, until the expiration of the twelve months which will follow a similar notification, whatever is the time at which it may take place.

Cette reclamation qinsi prouvee 1'extradition ne sera point refusee. Ces deserteurs lorsqu'ils auront ete arretes seront mis a la disposition des dits consuls, vice-consuls ou agens commerciaux et pourront etre enfermes dans les prisons publiques a la requisition et aux frais de ceux qui les reclament pour etre retenus jusqu'au moment ou ils pourront etre rendus aux batimens aux quels ils appartiennent, ou pour etre renvoyes dans leur pays sur des batimens nationaux ou autres. Mais s'ils ne sont pas renvoyes dans I'espace de trois mois, a compter du jour de leur arrestation, ils seront mis en liberte et ne pourront plus etre arretes pour la meme cause. Toutefois si le deserteur se trouvait avoir commis quelque crime ou delit, il pourra etre sursis a son extradition jusqu'a ce que le tribunal saisi de 1'affaire ait rendu sa sentence, et que celle-ci ait regu son execution.

ART. XVIII. Les sujets ou citoyens de chacune des parties contractantes pourront librement disposer par testament, donation, ou autrement, des biens personnels qu'ils possederont dans les etats de 1'autre, et leurs heritiers qui seront sujets ou citoyens de 1'autre nation pourront succeder a leurs biens personnels soit en vertu d'un testament soit ab intestato et en prendre possession, soit en personne soit par d'autres agissant en leur nom: ils pourront en outre en disposer a leur gre en ne payant a cet effet que les memes impositions, taxes ou droits aux quels sont assujettis dans des cas semblables les habitans du pays ou se trouvent les dits biens. En cas d'absence des heritiers, on donnera pour la conservation des dits biens les memes dispositions qu'on prendrait en pareil cas pour les proprietes des natifs du pays jusqu'a ce que le proprietaire ait fait les arrangemens necessaires pour recueillir 1'heritage. S'il s'elevait des contestations entre differens pretendans quant aux droits que chacun d'eux soutiendrait avoir sur la succession elles seront decidees en dernier ressort par les juges et selon les loix du pays ou ces biens seront situes. Et si par la mort d'une personne possedant des biens fonds sur le territoire d'une des deux parties contractantes, ces biens fonds venaient a passer par la derniere volonte de leur possesseur a un citoyen ou sujet de 1'autre partie qui par sa qualite d'etranger serait inhabile a les posseder, on lui accordera un delai convenable pour les vendre, pour en retirer et emporter le produit sans obstacles d'aucune sorte et sans qu'on lui impose au profit du Gduvernement respectif aucune taxe, imposition ou droit plus forts que ceux aux quels seraient soumis en pareils cas les habitans du pays ou ces biens sont situes.

ART. XIX. Le present traite sera en vigueur pendant dix annees a compter du jour de 1'echange des ratifications et si un an avant ce terme 1'une des parties contractantes n'avait pas annonce a 1'autre par une notification officielle, son intention d'en faire cesser 1'effet le dit traite restera obligatoire pendant douze mois au dela de ce terme et ainsi de suite jusqu'a 1'expiration des douze mois qui suivront une semblable declaration quelle que soit 1'epoque a laquelle elle aurait eu lieu.

Effect of this article.

Circumstances of a peculiar nature rendering it necessary for his Sardinian Majesty to continue for a time differential duties to the disadvantage of foreign flags, on grain, olive oil, and wine, imported directly from the Black Sea, the ports of the Adriatic, and those of the Mediterranean, as far as Cape Trafalgar, notwithstanding the general provisions of the articles No. 2, 3, and 4 of the present treaty, it is distinctly understood and agreed by the high contracting parties, that the United States shall have full and entire liberty to establish countervailing differential duties on the same articles imported from the same places to the disadvantage of the Sardinian flag, in case the existing or any other differential duties on the said articles, shall be continued in force, to the disadvantage of the flag of the United States of America by his Sardinian Majesty, beyond a period of four years, counting from the day of the exchange of the ratifications of the present treaty and separate article, but all countervailing differential duties on the said articles shall cease to be exacted from the time the United States Government shall have been informed officially of the discontinuance of differential duties on the part of his Sardinian Majesty.

of the States of New York and Vermont, exhorting their citizens to refrain from any unlawful acts within the territory of the United States ; and notwithstanding the presence of the civil officers of the United States, who, by my directions, have visited the scenes of commotion with a view of impressing the citizens with a proper sense of their duty, the excitement, instead of being appeased, is every day increasing in degree--that arms and munitions of war, and other supplies, have been procured by the insurgents in the United States--that a military force, consisting in part, at least, of citizens of the United States, had been actually organized, had congregated at Navy Island, and were still in arms under the command of a citizen of the United States, and that they were constantly receiving accessions and aid.
Now, therefore, to the end that the authority of the laws may be maintained, and the faith of treaties observed, I, MARTIN VAN BUREN, do most earnestly exhort all citizens of the United States who have thus violated their duties, to return peaceably to their respective homes ; and I hereby warn them, that any persons who shall compromit the neutrality of this government by interfering in an unlawful manner with the affairs of the neighboring British Provinces, will render themselves liable to arrest and punishment under the laws of the United States, which will be rigidly enforced ; and, also, that they will receive no aid or countenance from their government into whatever difficulties they may be thrown by the violation of the laws of their country, and the territory of a neighboring and friendly nation.

No. 33. Enjoining Neutrality as to Canada. BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Nov. 21, 1838.

A PROCLAMATION.

Whe re as there is too much reason to believe that citizens of the United States, in disregard of the solemn warning heretofore given to them by the proclamations issued by the Executive of the general government, and by some of the governors of the States, have combined to disturb the peace of the dominions of a neighboring and friendly nation, and whereas information has been given to me, derived from official and other sources, that many citizens in different parts of the United States are associated or associating for the same purpose: and whereas disturbances have actually broken out anew in different parts of the two Canadas: and whereas a hostile invasion has been made by citizens of the United States, in conjunction with Canadians and others, who, after forcibly seizing upon the property of their peaceful neighbor for the purpose of effecting their unlawful designs, are now in arms against the authorities of Canada, in perfect disregard of their obligations as American citizens, and of the obligations of the government of their country to foreign nations.
Now, therefore, I have thought it necessary and proper to issue this proclamation, calling upon every citizen of the United States neither to give countenance nor encouragement of any kind to those who have thus forfeited their claim to the protection of their country; upon those misguided or deluded persons who are engaged in them, to abandon projects dangerous to their own country, fatal to those, whom they profess a desire to relieve, impracticable of execution without foreign aid, which they cannot rationally expect to obtain, and giving rise to imputations (however unfounded) upon the honor and good faith of their own government; upon every officer, civil or military, and upon every citizen; by the veneration due by all freemen to the laws which they have assisted to enact for their own government; by his regard for the honor and reputation of his country; by his love of order and respect for the sacred code of laws by which national intercourse is regulated ; to use every effort in his power to arrest for trial and punishment every offender against the laws providing for the performance of our obligations to the other powers of the world. And I hereby warn all those who have engaged in these criminal enterprises, if persisted in,

Whe re as sundry important and weighty matters, principally growing out of the condition of the revenue and finances of the country, appear to me to call for the consideration of Congress at an earlier day than its next annual session, and thus form an extraordinary occasion, such as renders necessary, in my judgment, the convention of the two Houses as soon as may be practicable, I do therefore, by this my proclamation, convene the two Houses of Congress to meet in the Capitol at the city of Washington, on the last Monday, being the thirtyfirst day of May next. And I require the respective senators and representatives then and there to assemble, in order to receive such information respecting the state of the Union, as may be given to them, and to devise and adopt such measures as the good of the country may seem to them, in the exercise oi their wisdom and discretion, to require.

Discriminating tonnage duties levied by Greece on American vessels, abolished.
Tonnage duty on Greek vessels in U. S. ports shall cease to be levied.

And whereas satisfactory evidence has lately been received from His Majesty, the King of Greece, that the discriminating duties of tonnage levied by said nation on the ships or vessels of the United States, have been abolished:
Now, therefore, I, MARTIN VAN BUREN, President of the United States, do hereby declare and proclaim, that the tonnage duty on the vessels of the Kingdom of Greece shall, from this date, cease to be levied in the ports of the United States.

No. 31. Levying Tonnage Duty on Portuguese Vessels.

Oct. 11,1837. BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

A PROCLAMATION.

Preamble reciting that tonnage duty on vessels of Portugal is provisionally abolished, but the President authorized to levy said duty.
1832, ch. 104.
Vol. iv. p. 517.
Vessels of U. S. subjected to tonnage duty in ports of Portugal.
Tonnage duty henceforth to be levied on vessels of Portugal.

Whe re as , by an act of Congress of the United States of the twenty-fifth of

May, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-two, entitled " An act to exempt

the vessels of Portugal from the payment of duties of tonnage," it was enacted

as follows: " No duties upon tonnage shall be hereafter levied or collected of the

vessels of the kingdom of Portugal: Provided, always, That whenever the Pres-

ident of the United States shall be satisfied that the vessels of the United States

are subjected, in the ports of the kingdom of Portugal, to payment of any duties

of tonnage, he shall, by proclamation, declare the fact, and the duties now pay-

able by vessels of that kingdom, shall be levied and paid as if this act had not

been passed."

,

And whereas satisfactory evidence has been received by me, not only that

the vessels of the United States are subjected in the ports of the said kingdom

of Portugal to payment of duties of tonnage, but that a discrimination exists in

respect to those duties against the vessels of the United States.

Now, therefore, I, MARTIN VAN BUREN, President of the United States

of America, do hereby declare that fact, and proclaim, that the duties payable

by vessels of the said kingdom of Portugal, on the twenty-fifth day of May, one

thousand eight hundred and thirty-two, shall henceforth be levied and paid as if

the said act of the twenty-fifth of May, eighteen hundred and thirty-two, had not

been passed.

October, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-seven, and of the independence

of the United States the sixty-second.

No. 32. Enjoining Neutrality as to Canada.

Jan. 5,1838. BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

A PROCLAMATION.

Preamble as to Whe re as information having been received of a dangerous excitement on

citizens of U. S. the northern frontier of the United States, in consequence of the civil war begun

interfering in civil war in

in Canada, and instructions having been given to the United States officers on

Canada.

ing States to prevent any unlawful interference on the part of our citizens in the

contest unfortunately commenced in the British Provinces: additional information

has just been received, that, notwithstanding the proclamations of the governors

of the States of New York and Vermont, exhorting their citizens to refrain from any unlawful acts within the territory of the United States ; and notwithstanding the presence of the civil officers of the United States, who, by my directions, have visited the scenes of commotion with a view of impressing the citizens with a proper sense of their duty, the excitement, instead of being appeased, is every day increasing in degree--that arms and munitions of war, and other supplies, have been procured by the insurgents in the United States--that a military force, consisting in part, at least, of citizens of the United States, had been actually organized, had congregated at Navy Island, and were still in arms under the command of a citizen of the United States, and that they were constantly receiving accessions and aid.
Now, therefore, to the end that the authority of the laws may be maintained, and the faith of treaties observed, I, MARTIN VAN BUREN, do most earnestly exhort all citizens of the United States who have thus violated their duties, to return peaceably to their respective homes ; and I hereby warn them, that any persons who shall compromit the neutrality of this government by interfering in an unlawful manner with the affairs of the neighboring British Provinces, will render themselves liable to arrest and punishment under the laws of the United States, which will be rigidly enforced ; and, also, that they will receive no aid or countenance from their government into whatever difficulties they may be thrown by the violation of the laws of their country, and the territory of a neighboring and friendly nation.

Liable to arrest and punishment.

No. 33. Enjoining Neutrality as to Canada. BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Nov. 21, 1838.

A PROCLAMATION.

Whe re as there is too much reason to believe that citizens of the United States, in disregard of the solemn warning heretofore given to them by the proclamations issued by the Executive of the general government, and by some of the governors of the States, have combined to disturb the peace of the dominions of a neighboring and friendly nation, and whereas information has been given to me, derived from official and other sources, that many citizens in different parts of the United States are associated or associating for the same purpose: and whereas disturbances have actually broken out anew in different parts of the two Canadas: and whereas a hostile invasion has been made by citizens of the United States, in conjunction with Canadians and others, who, after forcibly seizing upon the property of their peaceful neighbor for the purpose of effecting their unlawful designs, are now in arms against the authorities of Canada, in perfect disregard of their obligations as American citizens, and of the obligations of the government of their country to foreign nations.
Now, therefore, I have thought it necessary and proper to issue this proclamation, calling upon every citizen of the United States neither to give countenance nor encouragement of any kind to those who have thus forfeited their claim to the protection of their country; upon those misguided or deluded persons who are engaged in them, to abandon projects dangerous to their own country, fatal to those, whom they profess a desire to relieve, impracticable of execution without foreign aid, which they cannot rationally expect to obtain, and giving rise to imputations (however unfounded) upon the honor and good faith of their own government; upon every officer, civil or military, and upon every citizen; by the veneration due by all freemen to the laws which they have assisted to enact for their own government; by his regard for the honor and reputation of his country; by his love of order and respect for the sacred code of laws by which national intercourse is regulated ; to use every effort in his power to arrest for trial and punishment every offender against the laws providing for the performance of our obligations to the other powers of the world. And I hereby warn all those who have engaged in these criminal enterprises, if persisted in,
