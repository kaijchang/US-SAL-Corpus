Incidental expenses of Congress.

Sect io n 1. Beit enacted by the Senate and House ofRepresentatives
of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That there be appropriated for the service of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety, to be paid out of the monies arising from the duties on imports and tonnage, the following sums, to wit: A sum not exceeding one hundred and forty-one thousand, four hundred and ninety-two dollars, and seventy-three cents, for defraying the expenses of the civil list, as estimated by the Secretary of the Treasury, in the statement annexed to his report made to the House of Representatives on the ninth day of January last, including therein the contingencies of the several executive offices which are hereby authorized and granted; and also, a sum not exceeding one hundred and fifty-five thousand, five hundred and thirty-seven dollars, and seventy-two cents, for defraying the expenses of the department of war; and the farther sum of ninety-six thousand, nine hundred and seventy-nine dollars, and seventy-two cents, for paying the pensions which may become due to the invalids, as estimated in the

(a) The power of naturalization is exclusively in Congress. Chirac v. Chirac, 2 Wheat. 259 ; 4 Cond. R A naturalized citizen, who in time of peace, returns to his native country for the purpose of trade, but
with the intention of returning again to his adopted country, continuing in the former, a year after the war between the two countries, for the purpose of winding up his business, engaging m no new commercial transactions with the enemy, and then returning to his adopted country, has gamed a domicil in his native country, and his goods are subject to condemnation. The Frances, 8 Cranch, 335; 3 Cond. Hep. 154.
The various acts on the subject of naturalization submit the decision upon the right of aliens to courts of record. They are to receive testimony ; to compare it with the law ; and to judge on both law and fact. If their judgment is entered on record in legal form, it closes all inquiry, and like other judgments, is complete evidence of its own validity. Spratt v. Spratt, 4 Peters, 393.

A certificate by a competent court, that an alien has taken the oath prescribed by the act respecting naturalization, raises the presumption that the court was satisfied as to the moral character of the alien, and of his attachment to the principles of the constitution of the United States. The oath when taken, confers the rights of a citizen. It is not necessary that there should be an order of court admitting him

Sixthly, That all persons indebted to this state, residing in the territory intended to be ceded by virtue of this act, shall be held and deemed liable to pay such debt or debts in the same manner, and under the same penalty or penalties as if this act had never been passed. Seventhly, That if the Congress of the United States do not accept the cession hereby intended to be made, in due form, and give official notice thereof to the executive of this state, within eighteen months from the passing of this act, then this act shall be of no force or effect whatsoever. Eighthly, That the laws in force and use in the State of North Carolina, at the time of passing this act, shall be, and continue in full force within the territory hereby ceded, until the same shall be repealed, or otherwise altered by the legislative authority of the said territory.

And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That the sovereignty and jurisdiction of this state, in and over the territory aforesaid, and all and every the inhabitants thereof, shall be and remain the same in all respects, until the Congress of the United States shall accept the cession to be made by virtue of this act, as if this act had never passed.

(a) Art. 4, sec. 1, Constitution of the United States.--The decisions of the courts of the United States upon this statute, and on the introduction in evidence of the " acts, records, and judicial proceedings of

theStat.es," have been :

.

Under the fourth article and 1st section of the constitution of the United States, and the act of 2bth May,

1790, if a judgment has the effect of record evidence in the courts of the State from which it is taken,

it has the same effect in the courts of every other State; and the plea of nil debet is not a good plea To

an action brought upon such judgment in a court of another State. Mills v. Duryee, 7 Cranch, 483 ; 2

Cond Rep. 578. See Leland v. Wilkinson, 6 Peters, 317. United States v. Johns, 4 Dall. 412. Fergu-

Cranch, 122; 3 Cond. Rep. 303.

,

Under the act of May 26, 1790, prescribing the mode in which the public records m each State shall

be authenticated, so as to take effect in every other State, copies of the legislative acts of the several

States, authenticated by having the seal of the State affixed thereto, are conclusive evidence of such acts

in every other State. No other formality is required, than the annexation of the seal, and in the absence

of all contrary proof, it must be presumed to have been done by an officer having the custody thereof,

and competent authority to do the act. United States v. Amedy, 11 Wheat. 392; 6 Cond. Rep. 362.

The record of a judgment in one State is conclusive in another, although it appears that the suit in

which it was rendered was commenced by an attachment of property, the defendant having afterwards

appeared and taken defence. Mayhew v. Thatcher, 6 Wheat. 129 ; 5 Cond. Rep. 34. In an action upon a judgment, in another State, the defendant cannot plead any fact in bar which
contradicts the record on which the suit is brought. Field v. Gibbs, Peters' C. C. R. Io5. See Green v. Sarmiento, Peters' C. C. R. 74. Blount v. Darrah, 4 Wash. C. C. R. 657. Turner v. Waddington, 3

Sec . 31. And be it further enacted, That the benefit of clergy shall not be used or allowed, upon conviction of any crime, for which, by any statute of the United States, the punishment is or shall be declared to

(a) Art. 4, sec. 1, Constitution of the United States.--The decisions of the courts of the United States upon this statute, and on the introduction in evidence of the " acts, records, and judicial proceedings of

theStat.es," have been :

.

Under the fourth article and 1st section of the constitution of the United States, and the act of 2bth May,

1790, if a judgment has the effect of record evidence in the courts of the State from which it is taken,

it has the same effect in the courts of every other State; and the plea of nil debet is not a good plea To

an action brought upon such judgment in a court of another State. Mills v. Duryee, 7 Cranch, 483 ; 2

Cond Rep. 578. See Leland v. Wilkinson, 6 Peters, 317. United States v. Johns, 4 Dall. 412. Fergu-

Cranch, 122; 3 Cond. Rep. 303.

,

Under the act of May 26, 1790, prescribing the mode in which the public records m each State shall

be authenticated, so as to take effect in every other State, copies of the legislative acts of the several

States, authenticated by having the seal of the State affixed thereto, are conclusive evidence of such acts

in every other State. No other formality is required, than the annexation of the seal, and in the absence

of all contrary proof, it must be presumed to have been done by an officer having the custody thereof,

and competent authority to do the act. United States v. Amedy, 11 Wheat. 392; 6 Cond. Rep. 362.

The record of a judgment in one State is conclusive in another, although it appears that the suit in

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That from and after the passing of this act, the author and authors of any map, chart, book or books already printed within these United States, being a citizen or citizens thereof, or resident within the same, his or their executors, administrators or assigns, who hath or have not transferred to any other person the copyright of such map, chart, book or books, share or shares thereof; and any other person or persons, being a citizen or citizens of these United States, or residents therein, his or their executors, administrators or assigns, who hath or have purchased or legally acquired the copyright of any such map, chart, book or books, in order to print, reprint, publish or vend the same, shall have the sole right and liberty of printing, reprinting, publishing and vending such map, chart, book or books, for the term of fourteen years from the recording the title thereof in the clerk's office, as is herein after directed : And that the author and authors of any map, chart, book or books already made and composed, and not printed or published, or that shall hereafter be made and composed, being a citizen or citizens of these United States, or resident therein, and his or their executors, administrators or assigns, shall have the sole right and liberty of printing, reprinting, publishing and vending such map, chart, book or books, for the like term of fourteen years from the time of recording the title thereof in the clerk's office as aforesaid. And if, at the expiration of the said term, the author or authors, or any of them, be living, and a citizen or citizens of these United States, or resident therein, the same exclusive right shall be continued to him or them, his or their executors, administrators or assigns, for the further term of fourteen years *. Provided, he or they shall cause the title thereof to be a second time recorded and published in the same manner as is herein after directed, and that within six months before the expiration of the first term of fourteen years aforesaid.
Sec . 2. And be it further enacted, That if any other person or persons, from and after the recording the title of any map, chart, book or books, and publishing the same as aforesaid, and within the times limited and granted by this act, shall print, reprint, publish, or import, or cause to be printed, reprinted, published, or imported from any foreign kingdom or state, any copy or copies of such map, chart, book or books, without the consent of the author or proprietor thereof, first had and obtained in writing, signed in the presence of two or more credible witnesses ; or knowing the same to be so printed, reprinted, or imported, shall publish, sell, or expose to sale, or cause to be published, sold, or

Congress, by the act of 1790, instead of sanctioning an existing, perpetual copyright in an author in his works, created the right, secured for a limited time by the provisions of the law. Wheaton et al. v. Peters et al., 8 Peters, 591.
The acts required by the laws of the United States to be done by an author to secure his copyright, are in the order in which they must naturally transpire. First, the title of the book must be deposited with the clerk, and the record he makes must be inserted on the first or second page; then public notice in the newspapers must be given; and within six months after the publication of the book, a copy must be deposited in the department of state. These are acts which the law requires to be done. Every requisite under both acts of Congress is essential to the title. Ibid.
In the 8th section of the 1st article of the constitution of the United States, it is declared that Congress shall have power " to promote the progress of the useful arts by securing for a limited time to authors and inventors, the exclusive right to their writings and inventions." The word " secure," as used in the constitution, could not mean the protection of an acknowledged legal right. It refers to inventors as well as authors, and it has never been pretended by any one, either in this country or in England, that an inventor has a perpetual right at common law, to sell the thing invented. Ibid.
Every requisite under both acts of Congress relative to copyrights, is essential to the title. Ibid.

offender or offenders shall forfeit all and every copy and copies of such

map, chart, book or books, and all and every sheet and sheets, being

part of the same, or either of them, to the author or proprietor of such

map, chart, book or books, who shall forthwith destroy the same: And

every such offender and offenders shall also forfeit and pay the sum of

fifty cents for every sheet which shall be found in his or their possession,

either printed or printing, published, imported or exposed to sale, con-

trary to the true intent and meaning of this act, the one moiety thereof

to the author or proprietor of such map, chart, book or books who shall

sue for the same, and the other moiety thereof to and for the use of the

United States, to be recovered by action of debt in any court of record

in the United States, wherein the same is cognizable. Provided always,

That such action be commenced within one year after the cause of ac-

Sec . 3. And be it further enacted, That no person shall be entitled

to the benefit of this act, in cases where any map, chart, book or books,

hath or have been already printed and published, unless he shall first

deposit, and in all other cases, unless he shall before publication deposit

a printed copy of the title of such map, chart, book or books, in the

clerk's office of the district court where the author or proprietor shall

reside: And the clerk of such court is hereby directed and required to

record the same forthwith, in a book to be kept by him for that purpose,

in the words following, (giving a copy thereof to the said author or pro-

published in one or more of the newspapers printed in the United States,

for the space of four weeks.

Sec . 4. And be it further enacted, That the author or proprietor of

any such map, chart, book or books, shall, within six months after the

publishing thereof, deliver, or cause to be delivered to the Secretary of

State a copy of the same, to be preserved in his office.

Sec . 5. And be it further enacted, That nothing in this act shall be

States, in foreign parts or places without the jurisdiction of the United

(a) Murder.--Congress have not in the 8th section of the act of April 30,1790, for the prevention of certain crimes against the United States, exercised the power, if any such is given by the constitution of the United States, of conferring jurisdiction on the courts of the United States of a murder committed on the waters of a State where the tide ebbs and flows. United States v. Bevans, 3 Wheat. 336 ; 4 Cond. Rep. 275.
The 3d article of the constitution of the United States, which declares that "the judicial power of the United States shall extend to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction," vests in the United States exclusive jurisdiction of all such cases; and a murder committed on the waters of a State where the tide ebbs and flows, is a case of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. Ibid.
The courts of the United States have jurisdiction of a murder committed on the high seas from a vessel belonging to the United States, by a foreigner being on board of such vessel, upon another foreigner being on board of another vessel. 5 Wheat. 184; 4 Cond. Rep. 623.
The courts of the United States have jurisdiction, under the act of April 30, 1790, of a murder committed on the high seas, although not committed on board of a vessel of the United States, as if she had no national character, but was held by pirates or persons not sailing under the flag of any foreign nation. The United States v. Holmes et al., 5 Wheat. 412 ; 4 Cond. Rep. 708. See also United States v. Magill, 1 Wash. C. C. R. 463. United States v. Drew, 5 Mason's C. C. R. 28. United States v.

Accessaries therein, how punished.
Concealing a pirate or property taken by a pirate.

laws of the United States be punishable with death; or if any captain or mariner of any ship or other vessel, shall piratically and feloniously run away with such ship or vessel, or any goods or merchandise to the value of fifty dollars, or yield up such ship or vessel voluntarily to any pirate; or if any seaman shall lay violent hands upon his commander, thereby to hinder and prevent his fighting in defence of his ship or goods committed to his trust, or shall make a revolt in the ship; every such offender shall be deemed, taken and adjudged to be a pirate and felon, and being thereof convicted, shall suffer death; and the trial of crimes committed on the high seas, or in any place out of the jurisdiction of any particular state, shall be in the district where the offender is apprehended, or into which he may first be brought.(a)
Sec . 9. And be it [further] enacted, That if any citizen shall commit any piracy or robbery aforesaid, or any act of hostility against the United States, or any citizen thereof, upon the high sea, under colour of any commission from any foreign prince, or state, or on pretence of authority from any person, such offender shall, notwithstanding the pretence of any such authority, be deemed, adjudged and taken to be a pirate, felon, and robber, and on being thereof convicted shall suffer death.
Sec . 10. And be it [further] enacted, That every person who shall, either upon the land or the seas, knowingly and wittingly aid and assist, procure, command, counsel or advise any person or persons, to do or commit any murder or robbery, or other piracy aforesaid, upon the seas, which shall affect the life of such person, and such person or persons shall thereupon do or commit any such piracy or robbery, then all and every such person so as aforesaid aiding, assisting, procuring, commanding, counselling or advising the same, either upon the land or the sea, shall be, and they are hereby declared, deemed and adjudged to be accessary to such piracies before the fact, and every such person being thereof convicted shall suffer death.
Sec . 11. And be it [further] enacted, That after any murder, felony, robbery, or other piracy whatsoever aforesaid, is or shall be committed by any pirate or robber, every person who knowing that such pirate or robber has done or committed any such piracy or robbery, shall on the land or at sea receive, entertain or conceal any such pirate or robber, or receive or take into his custody any ship, vessel, goods or chattels, which have been by any such pirate or robber piratically and feloniously taken, shall be, and are hereby declared, deemed and adjudged to be accessary to such piracy or robbery, after the fact; and on conviction thereof, shall be imprisoned not exceeding three years, and fined not exceeding five hundred dollars.

(a.) A robbery committed on the high seas, although such robbery, if committed on land, would not, by the laws of the United States, be punishable with death, is piracy, under the 8th section of the law of the United States ; and the Circuit Courts have jurisdiction thereof. United States v. Palmer, 3 Wheat. 610; 4 Cond. Rep. 352.
The crime of robbery as mentioned in the act, is the crime of robbery as recognized at common law. Ibid. See also United States v. Klintock, 5 Wheat. 144; 4 Cond. Rep. 614. The United States v. Smith, 5 Wheat. 153 ; 4 Cond. Rep. 619. United States v. Furlong et al., 5 Wheat. 184; 4 Cond. Rep. 623. United States v. Holmes, 5 Wheat. 412 ; 4 Cond. Rep. 708.
Pirates may be lawfully captured by the public or private ships of any nation, in peace or war, for they are hostes humani generis. The Marianna Flora, 11 Wheat. 1 ; 6 Cond. Rep. 201. See also The Josefa Segunda, 5 Wheat. 338; 4 Cond. Rep. 672. The Palmyra, 12 Wheat. 1; 6 Cond. Rep. 397. The Bello Corrunnes, 6 Wheat. 152; 5 Cond. Rep. 45.
To constitute the offence of piracy within the act of 1790, " by piratically and feloniously running away with a vessel," personal force and violence are not necessary. 1 Gallis' C. C. R. 247. See also The United States v. Ross, 1 Gallis' C. C. R. 624. United States v. Kessler, 1 Baldwin's C. C. R. 15. United States v. Gibert, 2 Sumner's C. C. R. 19.
In the act of April 30, 1790, the description of places contained in the Sth section, within which the offences therein enumerated must be committed, in order to give the courts of the United States jurisdiction over them, cannot be transferred to the 12th section, so as to give those courts jurisdiction over a manslaughter committed in a port of a foreign country, and not on the high seas. The Hoppet v. The United States, 7 Cranch, 389; 2 Cond. Rep. 542. See United States v. Wiltberger, 5 Wheat. 76;
4 Cond. Rep. 593.

(a) Although the crimes act of 1790, sec. 12, does not define the offence of endeavouring to make a revolt, it is competent for the court to give a judicial definition of it. United States v. Kelley, 11 Wheat. 417; 6 Cond. Rep. 370.
A revolt, is the usurpation of the authority and command of the ship, and an overthrow of that of the master, or commanding officer. Any conspiracy to accomplish such an object, or to resist a lawful command of the master for such purpose ; any endeavour to stir up others of the crew to such resistance, is an endeavour to make a revolt, within the meaning of the 12th section of the act of 1790.

Cha p. XXX.--An Act imposing duties on the tonnage of ships or vessels.

July 20, 1790.

Sect io n 1. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That upon all ships or vessels which after the first day of September next, shall be entered in the United States from any foreign port or place, there shall be paid the several and respective duties following, that is to say: On ships or vessels of the United States at the rate of six cents per ton : on ships or vessels built within the United States after the twentieth day of July last, but belonging wholly or in part to subjects of foreign powers, at the rate of thirty cents per ton: on other ships or vessels at the rate
of fifty cents per ton.(c) Sec . 2. And be it further enacted, That the aforesaid duty of six cents
per ton, shall be also paid upon every ship or vessel of the United States, which after the said first day of September next, shall be entered in a district in one state from a district in another state, other than an ad-

Tonnage duty on ships or vessels ofU. States,
on those of foreigners ;
on all others. On ships or
vessels of the U. States, trading between district and district.

(a) The act of Congress of July 20, 1790, for the government and regulation of seamen in the merchant service, has not changed the maritime law, except, perhaps, so far as respects medicines and medical advice, when there is a proper medicine chest, and medical directions on board the vessel. The charges for nursing and lodging are`not affected by the act. Harden v. Gordon et al., 2 Mason, 541.
The expense of curing a sick seaman, in the course of a voyage, is a charge on the ship by the mari-
time law. Ibid. The onus probandi in respect to the sufficiency of the medicine chest, lies on the owner, in an action
by the seamen for wages. Ibid. A stipulation that the seamen shall pay for medical advice and medicine, without any condition that
there shall be a suitable medicine chest, &c., is void as contrary to the act of Congress. Ibid. When a seaman at a foreign port, contracts an ordinary disease, without any fault of his own, and
remains on board a vessel which is properly provided with a medicine chest, the expense of a physician, if necessary for the safety of his life is to be deducted from his wages. Holmes v. Hutchinson, Gil-
pin's Rep. 448. (b) In reference to the claims of seamen for " short allowance," it was decided that the navy rations
furnish a rule by which the allowance to seamen shall be determined. That when the articles mentioned in the act of Congress can be procured, no substitute shall be allowed; but it is otherwise if they cannot be obtained. The ship Washington, 1 Adm. Decisions, 219.
The provisions of the act of Congress relative to short allowance, do not apply to seamen shipped while the ship is at a foreign port. Ibid.

Sect io n 1. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That from and after the first day of December next, every master or commander of any ship or vessel bound from a port in the United States to any foreign port, or of any ship or vessel of the burthen of fifty tons or upwards, bound from a port in one state to a port in any other than an adjoining state, shah, before he proceed on such voyage, make an agreement in writing or in print, with every seaman or mariner on board such ship or vessel (except such as shall be apprentice or servant to himself or owners) declaring the voyage or voyages, term or terms of time, for which such seaman or mariner shall be shipped.(a) And if any master or commander of such ship or vessel shall carry out any seaman or mariner (except apprentices or servants as aforesaid) without such contract or agreement being first made and signed by the seamen and mariners, such master or commander shall pay to every such seaman or mariner the highest price or wages which shall have been given at the port or place where such seaman or mariner shall have been shipped, for a similar voyage, within three months next before the time of such shipping: Provided such seaman or mariner shall perform such voyage: or if not, then for such time as he shall continue to do duty on board such ship or vessel; and shall moreover forfeit twenty dollars for every such seaman or mariner, one half to the use of the person prosecuting for the same, the other half to the use of the United States : and such seaman or mariner, not having signed such contract, shall not be bound by the regulations, nor subject to the penalties and forfeitures contained in this act.

And if any such seaman or mariner shall neglect to render himself on board the ship or vessel, for which he has shipped, at the time mentioned in such memorandum, and if the master, commander, or other officer of the ship or vessel, shall, on the day on which such neglect happened, make an entry in the log-book of such ship or vessel, of the name of such seaman or mariner, and shall in like manner note the time that he so neglected to render himself (after the time appointed); every such seaman or mariner shall forfeit for every hour which he shall so neglect to render himself, one day's pay, according to the rate of wages agreed upon, to be deducted out of his wages.(6) And if

The crew of a ship who have signed articles for the voyage under a particular master, without any clause providing for the change of master, are not discharged from the articles by the dismissal of the master by reason of sickness or any other reasonable cause, and the appointment of a new master. They are bound to obey the new master. The United States v. Ruggles, 5 Mason's C. C. R. 192.
If the shipping articles are to the final port of discharge, the voyage is not ended until the cargo is wholly unladen. The owner may order the vessel from port to port, until the whole cargo is discharged. The United States v. Barker, 5 Mason's C. C. R. 404.
In the shipping articles used in the United States, though wages are designated by the month, yet the contract is entire for the voyage. 1 Adm. Decisions, 142.
A seaman shipped for the voyage, without signing the articles, must be paid the highest rate of wages at the port within three months, and be subject to all the forfeitures imposed and fixed by the maritime law existing before the act of Congress. The Regulus, 1 Admiralty Decisions, 215.
The shipping articles must declare, explicitly, the ports at which the voyage is to commence and terminate. Magee v. The Moss, Gilpin's Rep. 219.
(b) To justify the forfeiture of a seaman's wages for absence, under the provisions of the act of 1790, the entry in the log-book is indispensable. Wood v. The Nimrod, Gilpin's Rep. 86, 212. Brower v. The Maiden, Gilpin's Rep. 296.

But if the complaint of the said crew shall appear upon the said report and judgment, to have been without foundation, then the said master, or the owner or consignee of such ship or vessel, shall deduct the amount thereof, and of reasonable damages for the detention (to be ascertained by the said judge or justice) out of the wages growing due to the complaining seamen or mariners. And if after such judgment, such ship or vessel is fit to proceed on her intended voyage, or after procuring such men, provisions, stores, repairs or alterations as may be directed, the said seamen or mariners, or either of them, shall refuse to proceed on the voyage, it shall and may be lawful for any justice of the peace to commit by warrant under his hand and

Sec . 7. Andbe it [further] enacted, That if any seaman or mariner, who shall have signed a contract to perform a voyage, shall, at any port or place, desert, or shall absent himself from such ship or vessel, without leave of the master, or officer commanding in the absence of the master, it shall be lawful for any justice of peace within the United States (upon the complaint of the master) to issue his warrant to apprehend such deserter, and bring him before such justice; and if it shall then appear by

apothecary, once at least in every year, and supplied with fresh medi-

July 20, 1790.

Sect io n 1. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That upon all ships or vessels which after the first day of September next, shall be entered in the United States from any foreign port or place, there shall be paid the several and respective duties following, that is to say: On ships or vessels of the United States at the rate of six cents per ton : on ships or vessels built within the United States after the twentieth day of July last, but belonging wholly or in part to subjects of foreign powers, at the rate of thirty cents per ton: on other ships or vessels at the rate
of fifty cents per ton.(c) Sec . 2. And be it further enacted, That the aforesaid duty of six cents
per ton, shall be also paid upon every ship or vessel of the United States, which after the said first day of September next, shall be entered in a district in one state from a district in another state, other than an ad-

Tonnage duty on ships or vessels ofU. States,
on those of foreigners ;
on all others. On ships or
vessels of the U. States, trading between district and district.

(a) The act of Congress of July 20, 1790, for the government and regulation of seamen in the merchant service, has not changed the maritime law, except, perhaps, so far as respects medicines and medical advice, when there is a proper medicine chest, and medical directions on board the vessel. The charges for nursing and lodging are`not affected by the act. Harden v. Gordon et al., 2 Mason, 541.
The expense of curing a sick seaman, in the course of a voyage, is a charge on the ship by the mari-
time law. Ibid. The onus probandi in respect to the sufficiency of the medicine chest, lies on the owner, in an action
by the seamen for wages. Ibid. A stipulation that the seamen shall pay for medical advice and medicine, without any condition that
there shall be a suitable medicine chest, &c., is void as contrary to the act of Congress. Ibid. When a seaman at a foreign port, contracts an ordinary disease, without any fault of his own, and
remains on board a vessel which is properly provided with a medicine chest, the expense of a physician, if necessary for the safety of his life is to be deducted from his wages. Holmes v. Hutchinson, Gil-
pin's Rep. 448. (b) In reference to the claims of seamen for " short allowance," it was decided that the navy rations
furnish a rule by which the allowance to seamen shall be determined. That when the articles mentioned in the act of Congress can be procured, no substitute shall be allowed; but it is otherwise if they cannot be obtained. The ship Washington, 1 Adm. Decisions, 219.
The provisions of the act of Congress relative to short allowance, do not apply to seamen shipped while the ship is at a foreign port. Ibid.
(c) See act of March 3, 1815, obsolete ; act of April 20, 1818, obsolete; act of March 3, 1819, obsolete.

And if any ship or vessel bound to a foreign port or place, shall depart on her voyage to such foreign port or place without such clearance, the said master or person having the said charge or command, shall forfeit and pay the sum of two hundred dollars for such offence.
Sec . 74. And be it further enacted, That after the first day of October next, the act, intituled "An act to regulate the collection of the duties imposed by law on the tonnage of ships or vessels, and on goods, wares and merchandises imported into the United States," and also all other acts or parts of acts coming within the purview of this act, shall be repealed, and thenceforth cease to operate, except as to the continuance of the officers appointed in pursuance of the said act; except also as to the recovery and receipt of such duties on goods, wares and merchandise, and on the tonnage of ships or vessels, as shall have accrued, and as to the payment of drawbacks and allowances in lieu thereof, upon the exportation of goods, wares or merchandise which shall have been imported, and as to the recovery and distribution of fines, penalties and forfeitures which shall have been incurred before or upon the said day, subject nevertheless to the alterations contained and expressed in
this present act. And whereas by the act, intituled "An act to regulate the collection
of the duties imposed by law on the tonnage of ships or vessels, and on goods, wares and merchandises imported into the United States," it was declared that the ruble of Russia should be rated at one hundred cents, and by the act, intituled "An act to explain and amend an act, intituled `An act for registering and clearing vessels, regulating the coasting trade, and for other purposes,' " that part of the said first mentioned act which so rated the ruble of Russia was repealed and made null and void. And whereas it is doubted whether the said repeal can operate with respect to duties incurred prior thereto, as was intended by Con-
gress : Sec . 75. Therefore be it enacted and declared, That the said repeal
shall be deemed to operate in respect to all duties which may have

Chap . XL.--An Act to enable the Officers and Soldiers of the Virginia Line on continental Establishment, to obtain Titles to certain Lands lying northwest of the River Ohio, between the Little Miami and Sciota.(a)
Secti on 1. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the act of Congress of the seventeenth of July, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-eight, relative to certain locations and surveys made by, or on account of the Virginia troops on continental establishment upon lands between the Little Miami and Sciota rivers, northwest of the Ohio, be, and the same is hereby repealed.(6)

(a) The acts relative to Virginia land warrants, and the regulations and locations thereof, have been : Act of August 10, 1790, chap. 40 ; act of June 9, 1794, chap. 62; act of May 13, 1800, chap. 59; act of April 26, 1802, chap. 30 ; act of March 2, 1807, chap. 21 ; act of March 16, 1810, chap. 23; act of June 26, 1812, chap. 109; act of November 3, 1814, chap. 2; act of February 22, 1815, chap. 48; act of April 11, 1818, chap. 43 ; act of February 9, 1821, chap. 10; act of May 20, 1826, chap. 138; act of April 23, 1830, chap. 73; act of May 30, 1830, chap. 215; act of July 13, 1832, cl ap. 205; act ofMarch 2, 1833 ; act of March 31, 1832, chap. 157 ; act of July 7, 1838, chap. 116.
(b) Under the reserve contained in the cession act of Virginia, and under the act of Congress of August 10, 1790, and of June 9, 1794, the whole country lying between the Sciota and Little Miami rivers, was subjected to the military warrants, to satisfy which the reserve was made. Doddridge v. Thompson, 9 Wheat. 469; 5 Cond. Rep. 645.
The reservation made by the law of Virginia of 1783, ceding to Congress the territory northwest of the river Ohio, is not a reservation of the whole tract of country between the rivers Sciota and Little Miami. It is a reservation of only so much as may be necessary to make up the deficiency of good lands set apart for the officers and soldiers of the Virginia line on the continental establishment, on the southeast side of the Ohio. The residue of the lands are ceded to the United States, as a common fund for those States who were, or might become members of the Union, to be disposed of for that purpose. Jackson v. Clarke et al., 1 Peters, 635.
Although the military rights constituted the primary claim upon the trust, that claim was according to the intention of the parties so to be satisfied as still to keep in view the interests of the Union, which were also a vital object of the trust. This was only to be effected by prescribing the time in which ths lands to be appropriated by those claimants, were to be separated from the general mass, so as to enable the government to apply the residue to the general purposes of the trust. Ibid.
If the right existed in Congress to prescribe a time within which military warrants should be located, the right to connect conditions to its extension, follows as a necessary consequence. Ibid.

by this act shall continue to be collected and paid, until the debts and purposes for which they are pledged and appropriated, shall be fully discharged: Provided, That nothing herein contained shall be construed to prevent the legislature of the United States from substituting other duties or taxes of equal value to any or all of the said duties and

[Repealed.]

Chap . XL.--An Act to enable the Officers and Soldiers of the Virginia Line on continental Establishment, to obtain Titles to certain Lands lying northwest of the River Ohio, between the Little Miami and Sciota.(a)
Secti on 1. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the act of Congress of the seventeenth of July, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-eight, relative to certain locations and surveys made by, or on account of the Virginia troops on continental establishment upon lands between the Little Miami and Sciota rivers, northwest of the Ohio, be, and the same is hereby repealed.(6)

(a) The acts relative to Virginia land warrants, and the regulations and locations thereof, have been : Act of August 10, 1790, chap. 40 ; act of June 9, 1794, chap. 62; act of May 13, 1800, chap. 59; act of April 26, 1802, chap. 30 ; act of March 2, 1807, chap. 21 ; act of March 16, 1810, chap. 23; act of June 26, 1812, chap. 109; act of November 3, 1814, chap. 2; act of February 22, 1815, chap. 48; act of April 11, 1818, chap. 43 ; act of February 9, 1821, chap. 10; act of May 20, 1826, chap. 138; act of April 23, 1830, chap. 73; act of May 30, 1830, chap. 215; act of July 13, 1832, cl ap. 205; act ofMarch 2, 1833 ; act of March 31, 1832, chap. 157 ; act of July 7, 1838, chap. 116.
(b) Under the reserve contained in the cession act of Virginia, and under the act of Congress of August 10, 1790, and of June 9, 1794, the whole country lying between the Sciota and Little Miami rivers, was subjected to the military warrants, to satisfy which the reserve was made. Doddridge v. Thompson, 9 Wheat. 469; 5 Cond. Rep. 645.
The reservation made by the law of Virginia of 1783, ceding to Congress the territory northwest of the river Ohio, is not a reservation of the whole tract of country between the rivers Sciota and Little Miami. It is a reservation of only so much as may be necessary to make up the deficiency of good lands set apart for the officers and soldiers of the Virginia line on the continental establishment, on the southeast side of the Ohio. The residue of the lands are ceded to the United States, as a common fund for those States who were, or might become members of the Union, to be disposed of for that purpose. Jackson v. Clarke et al., 1 Peters, 635.
Although the military rights constituted the primary claim upon the trust, that claim was according to the intention of the parties so to be satisfied as still to keep in view the interests of the Union, which were also a vital object of the trust. This was only to be effected by prescribing the time in which ths lands to be appropriated by those claimants, were to be separated from the general mass, so as to enable the government to apply the residue to the general purposes of the trust. Ibid.
If the right existed in Congress to prescribe a time within which military warrants should be located, the right to connect conditions to its extension, follows as a necessary consequence. Ibid.

And whereas the agents for such of the troops of the state of Virginia, who served on the continental establishment in the army of the United States, during the late war, have reported to the executive of the said state, that there is not a sufficiency of good land on the south-easterly side of the river Ohio, according to the act of cession from the said state to the United States, and within the limits assigned by the laws of the said state, to satisfy the said troops for the bounty lands due to them, in conformity to the said laws: to the intent therefore that the difference between what has already been located for the said troops, on the south-easterly side of the said river, and the aggregate of what is due to the whole of the said troops, may be located on the north-westerly side of the said river, and between the Sciota and Little Miami rivers, as
stipulated by the said state: Sec . 2. Be it further enacted, That the secretary of the depart-
ment of war shall make return to the executive of the state of Virginia of the names of such of the officers, non-commissioned officers and privates of the line of the said state, who served in the army of the United States, on the continental establishment, during the late war, and who, in conformity to the laws of the said state, are entitled to bounty lands; and shall also in such return state the aggregate amount in acres due to the said line by the laws aforesaid.
Sec . 3. And be it further enacted, That it shall and may be lawful for the said agents to locate to and for the use of the said troops, between the rivers Sciota and Little Miami, such a number of acres of good land as shall, together with the number already located between the said two rivers, and the number already located on the south-easterly side of the river Ohio, be equal to the aggregate amount, so to be returned as aforesaid by the secretary of the department of war.
Sec . 4. And be it further enacted, That the said agents, as soon as may be after the locations, surveys and allotments are made and completed, shall enter in regular order, in a book to be by them provided for that purpose, the bounds of each location and survey between the said two rivers, annexing the name of the officer, non-commissioned officer or private originally entitled to each; which entries being certified by the said agents or the majority of them, to be true entries, the book containing the same shall be filed in the office of the Secretary of
State. Sec . 5. And be it further enacted, That it shall be lawful for the
President of the United States to cause letters patent to be made out in such words and form as he shall devise and direct, granting to such person so originally entitled to bounty lands, to his use, and to the use of his heirs or assigns, or his or their legal representative or representatives, his, her or their heirs or assigns, the lands designated in the said entries: Provided always, That before the seal of the United States shall be affixed to such letters patent, the secretary of the department of war shall have indorsed thereon that the grantee therein named, was originally entitled to such bounty lands, and that he has examined the bounds thereof with the book of entries filed in the office of the Secretary of State, and finds the same truly inserted; and every such letters patent shah be countersigned by the Secretary of State, and a minute of the date thereof, and of the name of the grantee shall be entered of record in his office, in a book to be specially provided for the purpose.

Under the peculiar system of the Virginia land law, as it has been settled in Kentucky, and in the Virginia military district in Ohio, by usages adapted to the circumstances of the country, many principles have been established which are unknown to the common law. A long course of adjudication has fixed those principles, and they are to be considered as the settled rules by which those military titles are to be governed. Galt v. Galloway, 4 Peters, 334.

Sec . 3. Be it therefore further enacted, That a loan to the full amount of the said domestic debt be, and the same is hereby proposed; and that books for receiving subscriptions to the said loan be opened at the treasury of the United States, and by a commissioner to be appointed in each of the said states, on the first day of October next, to continue open until the last day of September following, inclusively; and that the sums which shall be subscribed thereto, be payable in certificates issued for the said debt, according to their specie value, and computing the interest upon such as bear interest to the last day of December next, inclusively; which said certificates shall be of these several descriptions, to wit:

the treasury, or of the said commissioners respectively, upon which the credit for the same shall exist at the time of transfer, by the proprietor or proprietors of such stock, his, her or their attorney: but it shall be lawful for the Secretary of the Treasury, by special warrant under his hand and the seal of the treasury, countersigned by the comptroller, and registered by the register, at the request of the respective proprietors, to authorize the transfer of such stock from the books of one commissioner to those of another commissioner, or to those of the treasury, and from those of the treasury to those of a commissioner.
Sec . 8. And be it further enacted, That the interest upon the said stock, as the same shall become due, shall be payable quarter yearly --that is to say : One fourth part thereof on the last day of March : one other fourth part thereof on the last day of June: one other fourth part thereof on the last day of September; and the remaining fourth part thereof on the last day of December in each year, beginning on the last day of March next ensuing; and payment shall be made wheresoever the credit for the said stock- shall exist at the time such interest shall become due--that is to say : At the treasury, if the credit for the same shall then exist on the books of the treasury, or at the office of the commissioner upon whose books such credit shall then exist. But if the interest for one quarter shall not be demanded before the expiration of a third quarter, the same shall be afterwards demandable only at the
treasury. And as it may happen that some of the creditors of the United States
may not think fit to become subscribers to the said Ioan: Sec . 9. Be it further enacted, That nothing in this act contained shall
be construed in any wise to alter, abridge or impair the rights of those creditors of the United States, who shall not subscribe to the said Ioan, or the contracts upon which their respective claims are founded; but the said contracts and rights shall remain in full force and virtue.
And that such creditors may not be excluded from a participation in the benefit hereby intended to the creditors of the United States in general, while the said proposed Ioan shall be depending, and until it shall appear from the event thereof what farther or other arrangements may be necessary respecting the said domestic debt:
Sec . 10. Be it therefore further enacted, That such of the creditors of the United States as may not subscribe to the said loan, shall nevertheless receive during the year one thousand seven hundred and ninetyone, a rate per centum on the respective amounts of their respective demands, including interest to the last day of December next, equal to the interest payable to subscribing creditors, to be paid at the same times, at the same places, and by the same persons as is herein before directed, concerning the interest on the stock which may be created in virtue of the said proposed loan. But as some of the certificates now in circulation have not heretofore been liquidated to specie value, as most of them are greatly subject to counterfeit, and counterfeits have actually taken place in numerous instances, and as embarrassment and imposition might, for these reasons, attend the payment of interest on those certificates in their present form, it shall therefore be necessary to entitle the said creditors to the benefit of the said payment, that those of them who do not possess certificates issued by the register of the treasury, for the registered debt, should produce previous to the first day of June next, their respective certificates, either at the treasury of the United States, or to some one of the commissioners to be appointed as aforesaid, to the end that the same may be cancelled, and other certificates issued in lieu thereof; which new certificates shall specify the specie amount of those in exchange for which they are given, and shall be otherwise of the like tenor with those heretofore issued by the said register of the treasury for the said registered debt, and shall be trans-

And whereas a provision for the debts of the respective states by the United States, would be greatly conducive to an orderly, economical and
effectual arrangement of the public finances : Sec . 13. Be it therefore further enacted, That a Ioan be proposed to

And that the sums which shall be subscribed to the said loan, shall be payable in the principal and interest of the certificates or notes, which prior to the first day of January last, were issued by the respective states, as acknowledgments or evidences of debts by them respectively owing, except certificates issued by the commissioners of army accounts in the state of North Carolina, in the year one thousand seven hundred and
eighty-six. Provided, That no greater sum shall be received in the certificates

amount of the sums which shall be subscribed to the said loan in the debt of any state, within the time limited for receiving subscriptions thereto, shall exceed the sum by this act allowed to be subscribed within such state, the certificates and credits granted to the respective subscribers, shall bear such proportion to the sums by them respectively subscribed, as the total amount of the said sums shall bear to the whole sum so allowed to be subscribed in the debt of such state within the same. And every subscriber to the said loan shall, at the time of subscribing, deposit with the commissioner the certificates or notes to be

person shall take the length and breadth as above directed, in respect to

a double decked ship or vessel, shall deduct from the said length three

whence they were imported, it shall be the duty of such collector to take

the said goods, wares and merchandise into his possession, and retain

the same, with reasonable care, at the risk and expense of the owner or

owners, consignee or consignees thereof, until their value at the time

and place of importation shall be ascertained by two reputable mer-

chants, to be chosen and appointed as in the case of damaged goods, or

goods not accompanied withan invoice; and until the duties arising

according to such valuation shall be first paid, or secured to be paid, as

required by this act in other cases of importation : Provided, That in

case of a prosecution for the forfeiture aforesaid, such appraisement

shall not be construed to exclude other proof upon the trial, of the actual

and real cost of the said goods at the said place of exportation.
