[No. 4.] --Joint Resolution concerning the Oregon Territory.

April 27, 1846.

Whe re as by the convention concluded the twentieth day of October, eighteen hundred and eighteen, between the United States of America and the King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, for the period of ten years, and afterwards indefinitely extended and continued in force by another convention of the same parties, concluded the sixth day of August, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and twenty-seven, it was agreed that any country that may be claimed by either party on the north-west coast of America, westward of the Stony or Rocky Mountains, now commonly called the Oregon Territory, should, together with its harbors, bays, and creeks, and the navigation of all rivers within the same, be " free and open " to the vessels, citizens, and subjects, of the two powers; but without prejudice to any claim which either of the parties might have to any part of said country ; and with this further provision, in the second article of the said convention of the sixth of August, eighteen hundred and twenty-seven, that either party might abrogate and annul said convention on giving due notice of twelve months to the other contracting party :
And whereas it has now become desirable that the respective claims of the United States and Great Britain should be definitely settled, and that said territory may no longer than need be remain subject to the evil consequences of the divided allegiance of its American and British population, and of the confusion and conflict of national jurisdictions, dangerous to the cherished peace and good understanding of the two countries :
With a view, therefore, that steps be taken for the abrogation of the said convention of the sixth of August, eighteen hundred and twentyty-seven, in the mode prescribed in its second article, and that the attention of the governments of both countries may be the more earnestly directed to the adoption of all proper measures for a speedy and amicable adjustment of the differences and disputes in regard to the said territory :

[No. 4.] --Joint Resolution concerning the Oregon Territory.

April 27, 1846.

Whe re as by the convention concluded the twentieth day of October, eighteen hundred and eighteen, between the United States of America and the King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, for the period of ten years, and afterwards indefinitely extended and continued in force by another convention of the same parties, concluded the sixth day of August, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and twenty-seven, it was agreed that any country that may be claimed by either party on the north-west coast of America, westward of the Stony or Rocky Mountains, now commonly called the Oregon Territory, should, together with its harbors, bays, and creeks, and the navigation of all rivers within the same, be " free and open " to the vessels, citizens, and subjects, of the two powers; but without prejudice to any claim which either of the parties might have to any part of said country ; and with this further provision, in the second article of the said convention of the sixth of August, eighteen hundred and twenty-seven, that either party might abrogate and annul said convention on giving due notice of twelve months to the other contracting party :
And whereas it has now become desirable that the respective claims of the United States and Great Britain should be definitely settled, and that said territory may no longer than need be remain subject to the evil consequences of the divided allegiance of its American and British population, and of the confusion and conflict of national jurisdictions, dangerous to the cherished peace and good understanding of the two countries :
With a view, therefore, that steps be taken for the abrogation of the said convention of the sixth of August, eighteen hundred and twentyty-seven, in the mode prescribed in its second article, and that the attention of the governments of both countries may be the more earnestly directed to the adoption of all proper measures for a speedy and amicable adjustment of the differences and disputes in regard to the said territory :
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the President of the

Where as serious difficulties have, for a considerable time past, existed between the different portions of the people constituting and recognized as the Cherokee nation of Indians, which it is desirable should be speedily settled, so that peace and harmony may be restored among them : and whereas certain claims exist on the part of the Cherokee nation, and portions of the Cherokee people, against the United States; therefore, with a view to the final and amicable settlement of the difficulties and claims before mentioned, it is mutually agreed by the several parties to this convention as follows, viz : --

Arti cle III.

Certain claims paid out of the $5,000,000 fund to be reimbursed by the U. S.
Ind. Treat., vol. 1, p. 485.

Whereas certain claims have been allowed by the several boards of commissioners heretofore appointed under the treaty of 1835, for rents, under the name of improvements and spoliations, and for property of which the Indians were dispossessed, provided for under the 16th
article of the treaty of 1835; and whereas the said claims have been paid out of the $5,000,000 fund; and whereas said claims were not justly chargeable to that fund, but were to be paid by the United States,
the said United States agree to reimburse the said fund the amount thus charged to said fund, and the same shall form a part of the aggregate amount to be distributed to the Cherokee people, as provided in
the 9th article of this treaty; and whereas a further amount has been allowed for reservations under the provisions of the 13th article of the treaty of 1835, by said commissioners, and has been paid out of the said fund, and which said sums were properly chargeable to, and should have been paid by, the United States, the said United States
further agree to reimburse the amounts thus paid for reservations to said fund; and whereas the expenses of making the treaty of New Echoto were also paid out of said fund, when they should have been borne by the United States, the United States agree to reimburse the same, and also to reimburse all other sums paid to any agent of the government, and improperly charged to said fund; and the same also shall form a part of the aggregate amount to be distributed to the Cherokee people, as provided in the 9th article of this treaty.

Provision for the equitable in terest of the Western Cherokees in lands

Arti cle IV.
And whereas it has been decided by the board of commissioners recently appointed by the President of the United States to examine and adjust the claims and difficulties existing against and between the Cherokee people and the United States, as well as between the Cher-

okees themselves, that under the provisions of the treaty of 1828, as well as in conformity with the general policy of the United States in relation to the Indian tribes, and the Cherokee nation in particular,
that that portion of the Cherokee people known as the " Old Settlers," or " Western Cherokees," had no exclusive title to the terri-
tory ceded in that treaty, but that the same was intended for the use of, and to be the home for, the whole nation, including as well that
portion then east as that portion then west of the Mississippi ; and whereas the said board of commissioners further decided that, inas-
much as the territory before mentioned became the common property of the w'hole Cherokee nation by the operation of the treaty of 1828, the Cherokees then west of the Mississippi, by the equitable operation of the same treaty, acquired a common interest in the lands occupied by the Cherokees east of the Mississippi River, as well as in those occupied by themselves west of that river, w'hich interest should have
been provided for in the treaty of 1835, but which was not, except in so far as they, as a constituent portion of the nation, retained, in proportion to their numbers, a common interest in the country west of
the Mississippi, and in the general funds of the nation; and therefore they have an equitable claim upon the United States for the value of that interest, whatever it may be. Now, in order to ascertain the
value of that interest, it is agreed that the following principle shall be adopted, viz.: all the investments and expenditures which are properly
chargeable upon the sums granted in the treaty of 1835, amounting in the whole to five millions six hundred thousand dollars, (which investments and expenditures are particularly enumerated in the 15th
article of the treaty of 1835,) to be first deducted from said aggregate sum, thus ascertaining the residuum or amount which would, under such marshalling of accounts, be left for per capita distribution among
the Cherokees emigrating under the treaty of 1835, excluding all extravagant and improper expenditures, and then allow to the Old Settlers (or Western Cherokees) a sum equal to one third part of said residuum, to be distributed per capita to each individual of said party of " Old Settlers," or " Western Cherokees." It is further agreed that, so far as the Western Cherokees are concerned, in estimating the expense of removal and subsistence of an Eastern Cherokee, to be charged to the aggregate fund of five million six hundred thousand dollars above mentioned, the sums for removal and subsistence stipu-
lated in the Sth article of the treaty of 1835, as commutation money in those cases in which the parties entitled to it removed themselves, shall be adopted. And as it affects the settlement with the Western
Cherokees, there shall be no deduction from the fund before mentioned in consideration of any payments which may hereafter be made out of said fund; and it is hereby further understood and agreed, that
the principle above defined shall embrace all those Cherokees west of the Mississippi, who emigrated prior to the treaty of 1835.
In the consideration of the foregoing stipulation on the part of the
United States, the " Western Cherokees, " or " Old Settlers, " hereby release and quit claim to the United States all right, title, interest, or
claim, they may have to a common property in the Cherokee lands east of the Mississippi River, and to exclusive ownership to the lands ceded to them by the treaty of 1833 west of the Mississippi, including the outlet west, consenting and agreeing that the said lands, together with the eight hundred thousand acres ceded to the Cherokees by the treaty of 1835, shall be and remain the common property of
the whole Cherokee people, themselves included.

It is mutually agreed that the per capita allowance to be given to the " Western Cherokees, " or " Old Settlers," upon the principle above stated, shall be held in trust by the government of the United States, and paid out to each individual belonging to that party or head of family, or his legal representatives, first deducting therefrom the
sum of fifty thousand dollars, to be paid to the delegation of that portion of the Cherokee people who are parties to the treaty, to defray the expenses of prosecuting their claims against the government of the United States, including the late Captain John Rogers. («) And it is further agreed, that the per capita allowance to be paid as aforesaid
shall not be assignable, but shall be paid directly to the persons entitled to it, or to his heirs or legal representatives, by the agent of the United States, authorized to make such payments.
And it is further agreed that a committee of five persons shall be
appointed by the President of the United States, from the party of " Old Settlers," whose duty it shall be, in conjunction with an agent of the United States, to ascertain what persons are entitled to the per

Indemnity for " Treaty Party."
Ind. Treat., vol. 1, p. 478.
Provision for heirs of Major Ridge, John Ridge, and Elias Boudinot.
Proviso.

And whereas many of that portion of the Cherokee people known and designated as the "Treaty Party," have suffered losses and incurred expenses in consequence of the treaty of 1835, therefore, to indemnify the Treaty Party, the United States agree to pay to the said Treaty Party the sum of one hundred and fifteen thousand dollars, of which the sum
of five thousand dollars shall be paid by the United States to the heirs or legal representative of Major Ridge, the sum of five thousand dollars to the heirs or legal representatives of John Ridge, and the sum of five thousand dollars to the heirs or legal representatives of Elias Bou-
dinot, and the balance, being the sum of one hundred thousand dollars, which shall be paid by the United States, in such amountsand to
such persons as may be certified by a committee to be appointed by the Treaty Party, and which committee shall consist of not exceeding five persons, and approved by an agent of the United States, to be enti-
tled to receive the same for losses and damages sustained by them, or by those of whom they are the heirs or legal representatives : Provided,
That, out of the said balance of one hundred thousand dollars, the present delegation of the Treaty Party may receive the sum of twentyfive thousand dollars, to be by them applied to the payment of claims and other expenses. And it is further provided that, if the said sum
of one hundred thousand dollars should not be sufficient to pay all the claims allowed for losses and damages, that then the same shall be paid to the said claimants pro rata, and which payments shall be in full of all claims and losses of the said Treaty Party.

Value of salines to be ascertained and paid to individuals
dispossessed of them.

Arti cle VII.
The value of all salines which were the private property of individuals of the Western Cherokees, and of which they were dispossessed, provided there be any such, shall be ascertained by the United States agent, and a commissioner to be appointed by the Cherokee authorities; and, should they be unable to agree, they shall select an umpire, whose decision shall be final; and the several amounts found due

brace all sums paid for improvements, ferries, spoliations, removal, and subsistence, and commutation therefor, debts and claims upon the Cherokee nation of Indians, for the additional quantity of land ceded to said nation ; and the several sums provided in the several articles of the treaty, to be invested as the general funds of the nation; and also
all sums which may be hereafter properly allowed and paid under the provisions of the treaty of 1835. The aggregate of which said several
sums shall be deducted from the sum of six millions six hundred and forty-seven thousand and sixty-seven dollars, and the balance thus found to be due shall be paid over, per capita, in equal amounts, to all
those individuals, heads of families, or their legal representatives, entitled to receive the same under the treaty of 1835, and the supplement of 1836, being all those Cherokees residing east at the date of said treaty and the supplement thereto.

Ind. Treat., vol. 1, p. 478.

Arti cle X.

It is expressly agreed that nothing in the foregoing treaty contained shall be so construed as in any manner to take away or abridge any rights or claims which the Cherokees now residing in States east of the Mississippi River had, or may have, under the treaty of 1835 and

and if by the Cherokees, then to say, whether the subsistence shall be charged at a greater rate than thirty-three, -ffy collars per head ; and also the question, whether the Cherokee nation shall be allowed interest on whatever sum may be found to be due the nation, and from what date and at what rate per annum.

Certain questions to be submitted to the Senate of U. S.

Ind. Treat, vol. 1, p. 478.

Arti cle XII. (a)
The Western Cherokees, called " Old Settlers," in assenting to the general provisions of this treaty, in behalf of their people, have expressed their fixed opinion that, in making a settlement with them upon the basis herein established, the expenses incurred for the removal and subsistence of Cherokees, after the twenty-third day of May, 1838, should not be charged upon the five millions of dollars allowed to the Cherokees for their lands under the treaty of 1835, or on the fund provided by the third article of the supplement thereto; and that no part of the spoliations, subsistence, or removal, provided for by the several articles of said treaty and the supplement thereto, should be charged against them in their settlement for their interest in the Cherokee country east and west of the Mississippi River. And the delegation of "Old Settlers," or " Western Cherokees," propose that the question shall be submitted with this treaty to the decision of the Senate of the United States, of what portion, if any, of the expenditures made for removal, subsistence, and spoliations, under the treaty of 1835, is properly and legally chargeable to the five million fund.

June 10, 1846.

The United States of America and his Majesty the King of Hanover, equally animated with a desire of placing the privileges of their navigation on a basis of the most extended liberality, and of affording otherwise every encouragement and facility for increasing the commercial intercourse between their respective States, have resolved to settle in a definitive manner the rules which shall be observed between the one and the other, by means of a treaty of navigation and commerce; for which purpose the President of the United States has conferred full powers on A. Dudley Mann, their special agent to his Majesty the King of Hanover, and his Majesty the King of Hanover has furnished
with the like full powers the Baron George Frederick de Falcke, of his privy council, Knight GrandCross of the Royal Guelphick Order ; who, after exchanging their full powers, found in good and due form, have concluded and signed,
subject to ratification, the following articles.

Die Vereinigten Staaten von America und seine Majestat der Kbnig von Hannover, von glei-

den beiderseitigen Staaten zu vermehren, haben beschlossen, die zwischen denselben zu beobachtenden Regeln durch einen Handels und Schifffahrts-Vertrag definitiv festzusetzen. Zu diessem Behufe haben seine Majestat der Kbnig von Hannover mit Voll-
