to the usage of the sea service. 2. The commanders of the ships of the United States, having on
board chaplains, are to take care, that divine service be performed twice a day, and a sermon preached on Sundays, unless bad weather, or other
extraordinary accidents prevent. 3. Any person who shall be guilty of profane swearing, or of drunk-
enness, if a seaman or marine, shall be put in irons until sober, and then flogged if the captain shall think proper--but if an officer, he shall forfeit two days pay, or incur such punishment as a court martial shall impose, and as the nature and degree of the offence shall deserve.

mander's absence (unless he be absent for a time by leave) shall not order any correction but confinement, and upon the captain's return on board, he shall then give an account of his reasons for so doing.
7. The captain is to cause the articles of war to be hung up in some public place of the ship, and read to the ship's company once a month.
8. Whenever a captain shall enter or enlist a seaman, he shall take care to enter on his books, the time and terms of his entering, in order
to his being justly paid. 9. The captain shall, before he sails, make return to the Secretary of
the Navy a complete list of all his officers and men, with the time and terms of their entering, and during his cruise or station, shall keep a true account of the desertion or death of any of them, and of the entering of others, and after the expiration of the time for which they were entered, and before any of them are paid off, he shall make return of a complete list of the same, including those who shall remain on

they served. 13.Any officer, seaman or other person, entitled to wages or prize
money, may have the same paid to his assignee, provided the assignment be attested by the captain and the purser; but the captain or commander of every vessel in the service of the United States, is to discourage his crew from selfing any part of their wages or prize money, and never to attest the letter of attorney until he is satisfied that the same is not granted in consideration of money given for the purchase
of wages, or shares of prize money. 14.When any officer or other person dies, the captain is forthwith to
have his name entered on the books of the ship, in order to the wages being forthwith paid to his executors or administrators.
15.A convenient place shall be set apart for the sick or hurt men, to which they are to be removed with their hammocks and bedding, when the surgeon shall advise the same to be necessary, and some of the crew shall be appointed to attend them, and keep the place clean;--cradles and buckets with covers, shah be made for their use, if necessary.

TREATY WITH PRUSSIA. 1799.
the rights, privileges and exemptions, in navigation and commerce, which the most favoured nation does or shall enjoy; submitting themselves nevertheless to the established laws and usages, to which are submitted the subjects of his Majesty the King of Prussia, and the subjects and citizens of the most favoured nations.
ARTICLE IV. More especially, each party shall have a right to carry their own produce, manufactures and merchandize, in their own or any other vessels, to any parts of the dominions of the other, where it shall be lawful for all the subjects and citizens of that other freely to purchase them, and thence to take the produce, manufactures and merchandize of the other, which all the said citizens or subjects shall in like manner be free to sell to them, paying in both cases, such duties, charges, and fees only, as are or shall be paid, by the most favored nation. Nevertheless, his Majesty the King of Prussia and the United States, respectively, reserve to themselves the right, where any nation restrains the transportation of merchandize to the vessells of the country of which it is the growth or manufacture, to establish against such nation retaliating regulations; and also the right to prohibit in their respective countries the importation and exportation of all merchandize whatsoever, when reasons of state shall require it. In this case the subjects or citizens of either of the contracting parties shall not import or export the merchandize prohibited by the other. But if one of the contracting parties permits any other nation to import or export the same merchandize, the citizens or subjects of the other shall immediately enjoy the same liberty.
ARTICLE V. The merchants, commanders of vessels, or other subjects or citizens of either party, shall not, within the ports or jurisdiction of the other, be forced to unload any sort of merchandise into any other vessel, nor to receive them into their own, nor to wait for their being loaded longer than they please.
ARTICLE VI. That the vessels of either party, loading within the ports or jurisdiction of the other, may not be uselessly harassed, or detained, it is agreed, that all examinations of goods, required by the laws, shall be made before they are laden on board the vessel, and that there shall be no examination after; nor shall the vessel be searched at any time, unless articles shall have been laden therein clandestinely and illegally, in which case the person by whose order they were carried on board, or who carried them without order, shall be liable to the laws of the land in which he is, but no other person shall be molested, nor shall any other goods, nor the vessel, be seized or detained for that cause.

Protection of property within the jurisdiction of each party.

ARTICLE VII. Each party shall endeavour by all the means in their power to protect and defend all vessels and other effects, belonging to the citizens or subjects of the other, which shall be within the extent of their jurisdiction by sea or by land; and shall use all their efforts to recover, and cause to be restored to the right owners, their vessels and effects, which shall be taken from them within the extent of their said jurisdiction

droits, privileges et exemptions dans la navigation et le commerce, dont jouit on jouira la nation la plus favorisee; se soumettant neanmoins aux loix et usages etablis, auxquels sont soumis les sujets de sa Majeste le Roi de Prusse et les sujets et citoyens des nations les plus favorisees.

ARTICLE IV.
En particulier chacune des deux nations aura le droit d'importer ses propres productions, manufactures, etmarchandises a bord de ses propres batimens, ou de tel autre, dans toutes les parties des domaines de 1'autre, ou il sera permis a tous les sujets et citoyens de 1'autre nation de les acheter librement, comme aussi d'y charger les productions, manufactures et marchandises de 1'autre, que tous les dits sujets ou citoyens auront la liberte de leur vendre, en payant dans 1'un et 1'autre cas tels impots, droits, et charges seulement, qui sont ou seront payes par la nation la plus favorisee. Cependant sa Majeste le Roi de Prusse et les Etats Unis de 1'Amerique se reservent le droit, au cas que quelque nation restreigne le transport des marchandises aux vaisseaux des pays dont elles sont la production, ou la manufacture, d'etablir envers cette nation des regiemens reciproques, se reservant de plus le droit de prohiber dans leurs pays respectifs 1'importation ou 1'exportation de toute marchandise quelconque, des que la raison d'etat 1'exige. En ce cas les sujets ou citoyens d'une des parties contractantes ne pourront importer ni exporter les marchandises prohibees par 1'autre. Mais si 1'une des parties contractantes permet a quelque autre nation d'importer ou d'exporter ces memes marchandises, les citoyens ou sujets de 1'autre partie contractante jouiront tout aussitot d'une liberte pareille.

ARTICLE V.

Les marchands, commandans de vaisseaux, et autre sujets ou citoyens de chacune des deux nations, ne seront pas forces dans les ports ou dans la jurisdiction de 1'autre, de decharger aucunes sortes de marchandises dans d'autres vaisseaux, ni de les recevoir a bord de leurs propres navires, ni d'attendre leur chargement, plus longtems qu'il ne leur

plaira.

ARTICLE VI.

Pour eviter que les vaisseaux de 1'une des deux parties contractantes ne soyent inutilement molestes, ou detenus, dans les ports ou sous la jurisdiction de 1'autre, il a ete convenu, que la visite des marchandises, ordonnee par les loix, se fera avant qu'elles ne soyent chargees sur le navire, et qu'ensuite elles ne seront plus assujetties a aucune visite. Et en general il ne se fera point de recherche a bord du vaisseau, a moins qu'on n'y ait charge clandestinement et illegalement des marchandises prohibees. Dans ce cas celui par 1'ordre duquel elles ont ete portees a bord, ou celui qui les y a portees sans ordres, sera soumis aux lois du pays ou il se trouve, sans que le reste de 1'equipage soit moleste, ni les autres marchandises ou le vaisseau saisis ou detenus par cette raison.
ARTICLE VII.

Chacune des deux parties contractantes tachera, par tous les moyens qui seront en son pouvoir, de proteger, et de defendre tous les vaisseaux, et autres effets appartenant aux citoyens ou sujets de 1'autre, et se trouvant dans 1'etendue de sa jurisdiction par mer ou par terre, et elle employera tous ses efforts pour recouvrer, et faire restituer aux proprietaries legitimes, les vaisseaux et effets, qui leur auront ete enleves dans 1'etendue de sa dite jurisdiction.

coast, belonging to the other, but not willing to enter into port, or who entering into port are not willing to unload their cargoes or break bulk, shall have liberty to depart, and to pursue their voyage, without molestation, and without being obliged to render account of their cargo, or to pay any duties, charges or fees whatsoever, except those established for vessels entered into port, and appropriated to the maintenance of the
port itself, or of other establishments for the safety and convenience of navigators, which duties, charges, and fees, shall be the same, and shall
be paid on the same footing, as in the case of subjects or citizens of the
country, where they are established.

Shipwrecks.
Alienation of personal estate. Real estate within the dominions of one party falling upon the subjects of the other.

ARTICLE IX.
When any vessel of either party shall be wrecked, foundered, or otherwise damaged, on the coasts or within the dominions of the other, their respective citizens or subjects shall receive, as well for themselves as for their vessels and effects, the same assistance, which would be due to the inhabitants of the country where the damage happens, and shall pay the same charges and dues only as the said inhabitants would be subject to pay in a like case; and if the operations of repair shall require that the whole or any part of the cargo be unladed, they shall pay no duties, charges or fees on the part, which they shall relade and carry away. The ancient and barbarous right to wrecks of the sea shall be entirely abolished with respect to the subjects or citizens of the two contracting parties.
ARTICLE X.
The citizens or subjects of each party shall have power to dispose of their personal goods within the jurisdiction of the other, by testament, donation, or otherwise, and their representatives, being subjects or citizens of the other party, shall succeed to their said personal goods, whether by testament, or ab intestato, and may take possession thereof, either by themselves, or by others acting for them, and dispose of the same at their will, paying such dues only as the inhabitants of the country, wherein the said goods are, shall be subject to pay in like cases. And in case of the absence of the representative, such care shall be taken of the said goods, as would be taken of the goods of a native in like case, untill the lawfull owner may take measures for receiving them. And if question should arise among several claimants, to which of them the said goods belong, the same shall be decided finally by the laws and judges of the land, wherein the said goods are. And where, on the death of any person, holding real estate, within the territories of the one party, such real estate would, by the laws of the land, descend on a citizen or subject of the other, were he not disqualified by alienage, such subject shall be allowed a reasonable time to sell the same, and to withdraw the proceeds, without molestation, and exempt from all rights of detraction on the part of the government of the respective States. But this article shall not derogate in any manner from the force of the laws already published, or hereafter to be published, by his Majesty the King of Prussia, to prevent the emigration of his subjects.

Freedom of conscience, worship, &c.

ARTICLE XI.
The most perfect freedom of conscience and of worship, is granted to the citizens or subjects of either party, within the jurisdiction of the other, and no person shall be molested in that respect, for any cause other than an insult on the religion of others. Moreover, when the subjects or citizens of the one party, shall die within the jurisdiction of the other, their bodies shall be buried in the usual burying grounds, or

tantes, arrivant sur une cote appartenant a 1'autre, mais n'ayant pas dessein d'entrer au port, on, qui, en y entrant, ne voudroient pas decharger leurs cargaisons, ou rompre leur charge, aurons la liberty de repartir, et de poursuivre leur route sans empechement, et sans etre obliges de rendre compte de leur cargaison, ni de payer aucuns impots, charges, ou droits quelconques, excepte ceux etablis sur les vaisseaux une fois entres dans le port, et destines a 1'entretien du port meme, ou a d'autres etablissemens, qui ont pour but la surety et la commodite des navigateurs; lesquels droits, charges et impots seront les memes, et se payeront sur le meme pied qu'ils sont acquites par les sujets ou citoyens
de 1'etat ou. ils sont etablis.
ARTICLE IX.
Au cas que quelque vaisseau appartenant a 1'une des deux parties contractantes auroit fait naufrage echoue ou souffert quelque autre dommage, sur les cotes ou sous la domination de 1'autre, les sujets ou citoyens respectifs recevront tant pour eux, que pour leurs vaisseaux et effets, la meme assistance, qui auroit ete fournie aux habitans du pays ou 1'accident arrive, et ils payeront seulement les memes charges et droits auxquels les dits habitans auroient ete assujettis en cas pareil. Et si la reparation du vaisseau exigeoit que la cargaison fut dechargee en tout ou en partie, ils ne payeront aucun impot, charge, ou droit, de ce qui sera rembarque et importe. L'ancien et barbare droit de naufrage sera entierement aboli a 1'egard des sujets ou citoyens des deux parties con-
tractantes.
ARTICLE X.
Les citoyens ou sujets de 1'une des parties contractantes auront, dans les etats de 1'autre, la liberte de disposer de leurs biens personnels, soit par testament, donation, ou autrement, et leurs heritiers, etant sujets ou citoyens de 1'autre partie contractante, succederont a leurs biens, soit en vertu d'un testament, ou ab intestat, et ils pourront en prendre possession, soit en personne, soit par d'autres agissant en leur place, et en disposer a leur volonte, en ne payant d'autres droits, que ceux auxquels les habitans du pays, ou la succession est devenu vacante, sont assujettis en pareille occurrence. Et en cas d'absence des heretiers, on prendra provisoirement des biens qui leur sont echus les memes soins, qu'on auroit pris en pareille occasion des biens des natifs du pays, jusqu'ace que le proprietaire legitime ait agree des arrangemens pour recueillir 1'heritage. S'il s'eleve des contestations entre differens pretendans ayant droit a la succession, elles seront decidees en dernier ressort selon les loix et par les juges du pays ou la succession est vacante. Et si par la morte de quelque personne, possedant des biens-fonds sur le territoire de 1'une des parties contractantes, ces biens-fonds venoient a passer, selon les loix du pays, a un citoyen ou sujet de 1'autre partie; celui-ci, si, par sa qualite d'etranger, il est inhabile de les posseder, obtiendra un delai convenable pour les vendre, et pour en retirer le provenu sans obstacle, et exempt de tout droit de retenue de la part du gouvernement des etats respectifs. Mais cet article ne derogera en aucune maniere a la force des lois qui ont deja ete publiees, ou qui le seront dans la suite par sa Majeste le Roi de Prusse pour prevenir 1'emigration de ses sujets.
ARTICLE XL
Il sera accorde la plus parfaite liberte de conscience et de culte aux citoyens et sujets de chaque partie contractante dans les etats de 1'autre, et personne ne sera moleste a. cet egard pour quelque cause que ce soit, si ce n'est pour insulte faite a la religion de 1'autre. De plus si des sujets et citoyens de 1'une des parties contractantes venoient a mourir dans la jurisdiction de 1'autre, leurs corps seront enterres dans les

TREATY WITH PRUSSIA. 1799.

other decent and suitable places, and shall be protected from violation or disturbance.

Relative to the principle of free ships making free goods.

ARTICLE XII. Experience having proved, that the principle adopted in the twelfth article of the treaty of 1785, according to which free ships make free goods, has not been sufficiently respected during the two last wars, and especially in that which still continues, the two contracting parties propose, after the return of a general peace, to agree either separately between themselves, or jointly with other powers alike interested, to concert with the great maritime powers of Europe, such arrangements and such permanent principles, as may serve to consolidate the liberty and the safety of the neutral navigation and commerce in future wars. And if in the interval, either of the contracting parties should be engaged in a war, to which the other should remain neutral, the ships of war and privateers of the belligerent power shall conduct themselves towards the merchant vessels of the neutral power, as favourably as the course of the war then existing may permit, observing the principles and rules of the law of nations, generally acknowleged.

Of contraband.

ARTICLE XIII. And in the same case of one of the contracting parties, being engaged in war, with any other power, to prevent all the difficulties and misunderstandings, that usually arise respecting merchandize of contraband, such as arms, ammunition and military stores of every kind, no such articles carried in the vessels, or by the subjects or citizens of either party, to the enemies of the other, shall be deemed contraband, so as to induce confiscation or condemnation and a loss of property to individuals. Nevertheless, it shall be lawful to stop such vessels and articles, and to detain them for such length of time, as the captors may think necessary to prevent the inconvenience or damage, that might ensue from their proceeding, paying however a reasonable compensation for the loss such arrest shall occasion to the proprietors; and it shall further be allowed to use in the service of the captors, the whole or any part of the military stores so detained, paying the owners the full value of the same, to be ascertained by the current price at the place of its destination. But in the case supposed of a vessel stopped for articles of contraband, if the master of the vessel stopped will deliver out the goods supposed to be of contraband nature, he shall be admitted to do it, and the vessel shall not in that case be carried into any port, nor further detained, but shall be allowed to proceed on her voyage.

All cannons, mortars, fire arms, pistols, bombs, grenades, bullets, balls, muskets, flints, matches, powder, salt-petre, sulphur, cuirasses, pikes, swords, belts, cartouch boxes, saddles and bridles, beyond the quantity necessary for the use of the ship, or beyond that which every man serving on board the vessel, or passenger, ought to have; and in general whatever is comprized under the denomination of arms and military stores, of what description soever, shall be deemed objects of contraband.

Documents to be carried by vessels in time of war.

ARTICLE XIV.
To ensure to the vessels of the two contracting parties the advantage of being readily and certainly known in time of war, it is agreed, that they shall be provided with the sea letters and documents hereafter specified:
1. A passport, expressing the name, the property and the burthen of

TREATY WITH PRUSSIA. 1799.

169

endroits ou 1'on a la coutume de faire les enterremens, ou dans tel autre lieu decent et convenable, et ils seront proteges contre toute violence et

trouble.

ARTICLE XII.

L'experience ayant demontre, que le principe adopte dans 1'Article douze du Traite de 1785, selon lequel les vaisseaux libres rendent aussi les marchandises libres, n'a pas ete suffisamment respecte dans les deux dernieres guerres, et nommement dans celle qui dure encore, les deux parties contractantes se reservent de s'entendre apres le retour de la paix generale, soit separement entr'elles, soit conjointement avec d'autres puissances co-interesses pour concerter avec les grandes puissances maritimes de 1'Europe, tels arrangenfens et tels principes permanens, qui puissent servir a consolider la liberte et la surete de la navigation et du commerce neutres dans les guerres futures.
Et si pendant cet intervalle, 1'une des parties contractantes se trouve engagee dans une guerre a laquelle 1'autre reste neutre, les vaisseaux de guerre et les armateurs de la puissance belligerante, se comporteront, a 1'egard de batimens marchands de la puissance neutre, aussi favourablement que la raison de guerre, pour lots existante pourra le permettre, en observant les principes et les regies du droit des gens generalement reconnus.

ARTICLE XIII.
Dans le cas ou 1'une des parties contractantes se trouveroit en guerre avec une autre puissance, il a ete convenu, que pour prevenir les difficultes, et les discussions, qui surviennent ordinairement par rapport aux marchandises de contrabande, telles que armes et munitions de toute espece, aucun de ces articles, charges a bord des vaisseaux des sujets ou citoyens de l'une des parties, et destines pour 1'ennemi de 1'autre, ne sera cense contrebande, au point d'impliquer confiscation ou condemnation, et d'entrainer la perte de la propriete des individus. Neanmoins il sera per mis d'arreter ces sortes de vaisseaux et effets, et de les retenir pendant tout le terns que le preneur croira necessaire, pour prevenir les inconveniens et les dommages qui pourroient en resulter autrement; mais dans ce cas on accordera une compensation raisonnable pour les pertes, qui auront ete occasionnees par la saisie. Et il sera permis en outre aux preneurs d'employer a leur service en tout ou en partie les munitions militaires detenues, en payant aux proprietaires la pleine valeur, a determiner sur le prix qui aura cours a 1'endroit de leur destination; mais si dans le cas enonce d'un vaisseau arrete pour des articles de contrebande, le maitre du navire consent a delivrer les marchandises suspectes, il aura la liberte de le faire, et le navire ne sera plus amene dans le port, ni detenu plus longtems, mais aura toute liberte de poursuivre sa route.
Seront censes objets de contrebande, les canons, mortiers, armes a feu, pistolets, bombes, grenades, boulets, bales, fusils, pierres a feu, meches, poudre, salpetre, souffre, cuirasses, piques, epees, ceinturons, poches a cartouches, selles et brides, au dela. de la quantite necessaire pour 1'usage du vaisseau, et au dela de celle que doit avoir chaque homme servant sur le vaisseau, ou passager, et en general tout ce qui est compris sous la denomination d'armes et de munitions de guerre, de quelque espece qu'elles puissent etre.

ARTICLE XIV.

Pour assurer aux vaisseaux des deux parties contractantes, 1'avantage d'etre promptement et surement reconnus en terns de guerre, on est convenu qu'ils devront etre munis des lettres de mer et documens

specifies ci-apres.

the vessel, as also the name and dwelling of the master, which passport shall be made out in good and due form, shall be renewed as often as the vessel shall return into port, and shall be exhibited whensoever
required, as well in the open sea as in port. But if the vessel be under convoy of one or more vessels of war, belonging to the neutral party, the simple declaration of the officer commanding the convoy, that the said vessel belongs to the party of which he is, shall be considered as
establishing the fact, and shall relieve both parties from the trouble of
further examination. 2. A charter-party; that is to say, the contract passed for the freight
of the whole vessel -- or, the bills of lading given for the cargo in
detail. 3. The list of the ship's company, containing an indication by name
and in detail of the persons composing the crew of the vessel. These documents shall always be authenticated according to the forms estab-
lished at the place, from which the vessel shall have sailed. As their production ought to be exacted only, when one of the con-
tracting parties shall be at war, and as their exhibition ought to have no other object than to prove the neutrality of the vessel, its cargo and company, they shall not be deemed absolutely necessary on board such vessels, belonging to the neutral party, as shall have sailed from its
ports, before or within three months after the government shall have been informed of the state of war, in which the belligerent party shall be engaged. In the interval, in default of these specific documents, the neutrality of the vessel may be established by such other evidence, as the tribunals, authorised to judge of the case, may deem sufficient.

Manner of visiting vessels not under convoy.

ARTICLE XV.
And to prevent entirely all disorder and violence, in such cases, it is stipulated, that when the vessels of the neutral party, sailing without convoy, shall be met by any vessel of war, public or private, of the other party, such vessel of war shall not send more than two or three men in their boat on board the said neutral vessel, to examine her passports and documents. And all persons belonging to any vessel of war, public or private, who shall molest or insult in any manner whatever, the people, vessels or effects of the other party, shall be responsible in their persons and property for damages and interest, sufficient security for which shall be given by all commanders of private armed vessels before they are commissioned.

Of embargoes. Seizures, detentions and arrests to be made in due course of law only.

ARTICLE XVI.
In times of war, or in cases of urgent necessity, when either of the contracting parties shall be obliged to lay a general embargo, either in all its ports, or in certain particular places, the vessels of the other party shall be subject to this measure, upon the same footing, as those of the most favoured nations, but without having the right to claim the exemption in their favour stipulated in the 16th article of the former treaty of 1785. But on the other hand the proprietors of the vessels which shall have been detained, whether for some military expedition, or for what other use soever, shall obtain from the government that shall have employed them, an equitable indemnity, as well for the freight as for the loss occasioned by the delay. And furthermore, in all cases of seizure, detention or arrest, for debts contracted or offences committed by any citizen or subject of the one party, within the jurisdiction of the other, the same shall be made and prosecuted by order and authority of law only, and according to the regular course of proceedings usual in such cases,

navire, ainsi que le nom et le domicile du maitre. Ces passeports, qui seront expedies en bonne et due forme, devront etre renouvelles toutes les fois que le vaisseau retournera dans son port, et seront exhibes a chaque requisition, tant en pleine mer, que dans le port. Mais si le navire se trouve sous le convoi d'un, ou de plusieurs vaisseaux de guerre, appartenants a la partie neutre, il suffira que 1'officier commandant le convoi declare que le navire est de son parti; moyennant quoi cette simple declaration sera censee etablir le fait et dispensera les deux parties de toute visite ulterieure.
2. De la Certe-partie, c'est a dire, du contrat passe pour le fret de tout la navire, ou des connoissements, donnes pour la cargaison en general.
Et 3. Du role d'equipage, contenant 1'indication nominate et detaillee des personnes, qui composent 1'equipage du navire. Ces documents
seront toujours expedies dans la forme etablie a 1'endroit, d'ou la navire aura mis a. la voile.
Comme leur production ne doit etre exigee, que dans le cas ou Pune des parties contractantes seroit en guerre, et que leur exhibition ne doit avoir d'autre but, que de prouver la neutrality des vaisseaux, de leurs equipages et de leurs cargaisons, ils ne seront pas censes absolument necessaires a bord des navires de la partie neutre, qui seront sortis de ses ports, avant, ou trois mois apres, que le gouvernement aura eu connaissance de 1'etat de guerre ou se trouve la partie belligerante. Pendant cet intervalle le naivre pourra, au defaut des documens ci-dessus specifies, prouver sa neutrality par tel autre temoignage, que les tribunaux, appelles a juger du cas, trouveront suffisans.

ARTICLE XV. Pour prevenir entierement tout desordre et toute violence en pareil cas, il a ete stipule, que lorsque les navires de la partie neutre, navigeant sans convoi, rencontreront quelque vaisseau de guerre, public ou particulier, de 1'autre partie, le vaisseau de guerre n'enverra pas plus de deux ou trois hommes dans sa chaloupe a bord du navire neutre pour examiner les passeports et documents. Et toutes les personnes appartenantes a quelque vaisseau de guerre public ou particulier, qui molesteront ou insulteront en quelque maniere que ce soit, 1'equipage, les vaisseaux ou effets de 1'autre partie, seront responsables en leurs personnes et en leurs biens, de tous dommages et interets, pour lesquels il sera donne caution suffisante par tous les commandans de vaisseaux armes en course, avant qu'ils recoivent leurs commissions.

ARTICLE XVI.
Dans les terns de guerre, et les cas de necessite urgente, ou 1'une des parties contractantes se verroit obligee d'etablir un embargo general, soit dans tous les ports de sa domination, soit dans certains ports particulars, les vaisseaux de 1'autre partie resteront assujettis a cette mesure, sur le meme pied que le seront les navires des nations les plus avantagees, sans pouvoir reclamer 1'exemption, qui avoit ete stipulee en leur faveur dans Particle XVI de 1'ancien traite de 1785. Mais d'un autre cote les proprietaires des vaisseaux, qui auront ete retenus, soit pour quelque expedition militare, soit pour tel autre usage que ce soit, obtiendront du gouvernement qui les aura employes, une indemnity equitable, tant pour le fret que pour les pertes occasionees par le retard.
De plus et dans 'tous les cas de saisie, de detention, ou d'arret, soit pour dettes contractees, ou offenses comrnises par quelque citoyen ou sujet de I'une des parties contractantes dans la jurisdiction de 1'autre, on procedera uniquement par ordre, et par autorite de la justice, et suivant les voyes ordinaires en pareil cas usitees.

Salvage on recapture, when one of the powers is neutral.

ARTICLE XVII.
If any vessel or effects of the neutral power be taken by an enemy of the other, or by a pirate, and retaken by the power at war, they shall be restored to the first proprietor, upon the conditions hereafter stipulated in the twenty-first article for cases of re-capture.

Right of asylum.

ARTICLE XVIII. If the citizens or subjects of either party, in danger from tempests, pirates, enemies or other accident, shall take refuge with their vessels or effects, within the harbours or jurisdiction of the other, they shall be received, protected, and treated with humanity and kindness, and shall be permitted to furnish themselves, at reasonable prices, with all refreshments, provisions, and other things necessary for their sustenance, health and accommodation, and for the repair of their vessels.

Bringing in of prizes.

ARTICLE XIX. The vessels of war, public and private, of both parties, shall carry freely, wheresoever they please, the vessels and effects taken from their enemies, without being obliged to pay any duties, charges, or fees to officers of admiralty, of the customs, or any others; nor shall such prizes be arrested, searched, or put under legal process, when they come to and enter the ports of the other party, but may freely be carried out again at any time by their captors to the places expressed in their commissions, which the commanding officer of such vessel shall be obliged to shew. But conformably to the treaties existing between the United States and Great Britain, no vessel, that shall have made a prize upon British subjects, shall have a right to shelter in the ports of the United States, but if forced therein by tempests, or any other danger, or accident of the sea, they shall be obliged to depart as soon as possible.

The subjects of one party shall not take letters of marque from the enemy of the other, &c.

ARTICLE XX. No citizen or subject of either of the contracting parties shall take from any power with which the other may be at war, any commission or letter of marque, for arming any vessel to act as a privateer against the other, on pain of being punished as a pirate; nor shall either party hire, lend or give any part of its naval or military force to the enemy of the other, to aid them offensively or defensively against the other.

Rules applicable to the prosecution of a common war.

ARTICLE XXL If the two contracting parties should be engaged in a war against a common enemy, the following points shall be observed between them.
1. If a vessel of one of the parties, taken by the enemy, shall, before being carried into a neutral or enemy's port, be retaken by a ship of war or privateer of the other, it shall, with the cargo, be restored to the first owners, for a compensation of one eighth part of the value of the said vessel and cargo, if the recapture be made by a public ship of war, and one sixth part, if made by a privateer.
2. The restitution in such cases shall be after due proof of property, and surety given for the part to which the recaptors are entitled.

3. The vessels of war, public and private, of the two parties, shall reciprocally be admitted with their prizes into the respective ports of each, but the said prizes shall not be discharged, or sold there, untill

173

ARTICLE XVII. S'il arrivoit que les batimens ou effets de la puissance neutre fussent pris par 1'ennemie de Pautre, ou par un pirate et ensuite repris par la puissance en guerre ils seront restitues au premier proprietaire, aux conditions qui seront stipulees ci-apres dans Particle XXI, pour les cas de reprise.
ARTICLE XVIII. Lorsque les citoyens ou sujets de Pune des deux parties contractantes, seront forces par des tempetes, ou par la poursuite des corsaires ou vaisseaux ennemis, ou par quelqu' autre accident, a se refugier avec leurs vaisseaux ou effets dans les havres, ou dans la juridiction de Pautre, ils seront recus, proteges, et traites avec humanite et honnetete. Il leur sera permis de se pourvoir a un prix raisonnable de rafraichissements, de provisions, et de toutes choses necessaires, pour leur subsistance, sante et commodite, et pour la reparation de leurs vaisseaux.
ARTICLE XIX. Les vaisseaux de guerre publics et particuliers des deux parties contractantes pourront conduire en toute liberte partout ou il leur plaira, les vaisseaux et effets, qu'ils auront pris sur leurs ennemis, sans etre obliges de payer aucuns impots, charges ou droits, aux officiers de Pamiraute, des douanes, ou autres. Ces prises ne pourront etre non plus ni arretees, ni visitees, ni soumises a. des procedures legales en entrant dans le port de Pautre partie, mais elles pourront en sortir librement, et etre conduites en tout temps par le vaisseau preneur aux endroits portes par les commissions, dont Pofficier commandant le dit vaisseau sera oblige de faire montre. Mais conformement aux Traites subsistans entre les Etats Unis et le Grande Bretagne, tout vaisseau qui aura fait une prise sur des sujets de cette derniere puissance, ne sauroit obtenir un droit d'asile dans les ports des Etats Unis, et s'il est force d'y relacher par des tempetes ou quelque autre danger ou accident de mer, il sera oblige d'en repartir le plutot possible.
ARTICLE XX. Aucun citoyen ou sujet de Pune des deux parties contractantes n'acceptera d'une puissance avec laquelle Pautre pourroit etre en guerre, ni commission, ni lettre de marque, pour armer en course contre cette derniere, sous peine d'etre puni comme pirate. Et ni Pun ni Pautre des deux etats ne louera, pretera ou donnera une partie de ses forces navales ou militaires, a Pennemi de Pautre, pour Paider a agir offensivement ou defensivement contre Petat qui est en guerre.
ARTICLE XXL S'il arrivoit que les deux parties contractantes fussent en memes terns en guerre contre un ennemie commun, on observera de part et d'autre les points suivans. 1. Lorsqu'un navire de Pune des deux nations sera repris par les vaisseaux de guerre ou armateurs de Pautre, avant d'avoir ete conduit dans un port ennemi ou neutre, il sera restitue avec sa cargaison au premier proprietaire, moyennant une retribution d'un huitieme de la valeur du navire et de la cargaison, si la reprise a ete faite par un vaisseau de guerre, et d'un sixieme, si elle a ete faite par un armateur. 2. Dans ces cas, la restitution n'aura lieu qu'apres les preuves faites de la propriete, sous caution de la quote-part, qui en revient a ceux qui out repris le navire. 3. Les vaisseaux de guerre publics et particuliers des deux parties contractantes seront admis reciproquement avec leurs prises, dans les ports respectifs, cependant ces prises ne pourront y etre dechargees, ni
p 2

TREATY WITH PRUSSIA. 1799.

their legality shall have been decided according to the laws and regulations of the state to which the captor belongs, but by the judicatories of the place, into which the prize shall have been conducted.
4. It shall be free to each party to make such regulations as they shall judge necessary, for the conduct of their respective vessels of war, public and private, relative to the vessels, which they shall take, and
carry into the ports of the two parties.

The ships of war of one party shall protect the vessels of the other.

ARTICLE XXII.
When the contracting parties shall have a common enemy, or shall both be neutral, the vessels of war of each shall upon all occasions take under their protection the vessels of the other going the same course, and shall defend such vessels as long as they hold the same course, against all force and violence, in the same manner as they ought to protect and defend vessels belonging to the party of which they are.

Regulations for softening the effects of war between the two parties.

ARTICLE XXIII.
If war should arise between the two contracting parties, the merchants of either country, then residing in the other, shall be allowed to remain nine months, to collect their debts and settle their affairs, and may depart freely carrying off all their effects, without molestation or hindrance, and all women and children, scholars of every faculty, cultivators of the earth, artisans, manufacturers and fishermen, unarmed and inhabiting unfortified towns, villages or places, and in general all others, whose occupations are for the common subsistence and benefit of mankind, shall be allowed to continue their respective employments, and shall not be molested in their persons, nor shall their houses or goods be burnt, or otherwise destroyed, nor their fields wasted by the armed force of the enemy, into whose power, by the events of war, they may happen to fall; but if any thing is necessary to be taken from them for the use of such armed force, the same shall be paid for at a reasonable
price.

ARTICLE XXIV.
And to prevent the destruction of prisoners of war, by sending them into distant and inclement countries, or by crouding them into close and noxious places, the two contracting parties solemnly pledge themselves to the world and to each other, that they will not adopt any such practice; that neither will send the prisoners, whom they may take from the other, into the East-Indies or any other parts of Asia or Africa, but they shall be placed in some parts of their dominions in Europe or America, in wholesome situations; that they shall not be confined in dungeons, prison-ships, nor prisons, nor be put into irons, nor bound, nor otherwise restrained in the use of their limbs, that the officers shall be enlarged on their paroles within convenient districts, and have comfortable quarters, and the common men be disposed in cantonments open and extensive enough for air and exercise, and lodged in barracks as roomly and good as are provided by the party in whose power they are, for their own troops; that the officers shall also be daily furnished by the party in whose power they are, with as many rations, and of the same articles and quality as are allowed by them, either in kind, or by commutation to officers of equal rank in their own army; and all others shall be daily furnished by them, with such ration as they shall allow to a common soldier in their own service; the value whereof shall be paid by the other party on a mutual adjustment of accounts for the subsistence of prisoners at the close of the war; and the said accounts shall not be mingled with or set off, against any others, nor the balances due

vendues, qu'apres que la legitime de la prise aura ete decidee suivant les lois ct regiemens de 1'etat dont le preneur est sujet, mais par la justice du lieu ou la prise aura ete conduite.
4. Il sera libre a chacune des parties contractantes de faire tels regiemens, qu'elles jugeront necessaires relativement a la conduite que devront tenir respectivement leurs vaisseaux de guerre publics et particuliers a 1'egard des batimens qu'ils auront pris et amenes dans les ports des deux puissances.
ARTICLE XXII. Lorsque les parties contractantes seront engagees en guerre contre un ennemi commun, ou qu'elles seront neutres toutes deux, les vaisseaux de guerre de 1'une prendront en toute occasion sous leur protection les navires de 1'autre, qui font avec eux la meme route, et ils les defendront aussi longtems qu'ils feront voile ensemble contre toute force et violence, et de la meme maniere qu'ils protegeroient et defendroient les navires de leur propre nation.
ARTICLE XXIII. S'il survient une guerre entre les parties contractantes, les marchands de 1'un des deux etats, qui resideront dans 1'autre, auront la permission d'y rester encore neuf mois, pour recueillir leurs dettes actives et arranger leurs affaires, apres quoi ils pourront partir en toute liberte, et emporter tous leurs biens, sans etre molestes ni empeches. Les femmes et les enfans, les gens de lettres de toutes les facultes, les cultivateurs, artisans, manufacturiers, et pecheurs, qui ne sont point armes, et qui iftbitent des villes, villages, ou places non-fortifiees, et en general tous ceux dont la vocation tend a la subsistance, et a. 1'avantage commun du genre humain, auront la liberte de continuer leurs professions respectives, et ne saront point molestes en leurs personnes, ni leurs maisons, ou leurs bien incendies, ou autrement detruits, ni leurs champs ravages par les armees de 1'ennemi, au pouvoir duquel ils pourroient tomber par les evenemens de la guerre, mais si 1'on se trouve dans la necessite de prendre quelque chose de leurs proprietes pour 1'usage de Farmee ennemie, la valeur en sera payee a une prix raisonnable.
ARTICLE XXIV. Afin d'adoucir le sort des prisonniers de guerre et de ne les point exposer a etre envoyes dans des climats eloignes et rigoreux, ou resserres dans des habitations etroites et malsaines, les deux parties contractantes s'engagent solemnellement I'une envers 1'autre et a la face de 1'univers, qu'elles n'adopteront aucun de ces usages, que les prisonniers qu'elles pourroient faire I'une sur 1'autre ne seront transposes ni aux Indes Orientales, ni dans aucune contree de 1'Asie, ou de 1'Afrique, mais qu'on leur assignera en Europe, ou en Amerique, dans les territoires respectifs des parties contractantes un sejour situe dans un air sain, qu'ils ne seront point confines dans des cachots, ni dans des prisons, ni dans des vaisseaux de prison, qu'ils ne seront pas mis aux fers, ni garotes, ni autrement prives de 1'usage de leurs membres; que les officiers seront relaches sur leur parole d'honneur dans 1'enceinte de certains districts qui leur seront fixes, et qu'on leur accordera des logemens commodes; que les simples soldats seront distribues dans des cantonnemens ouverts, assez vastes pour prendre Fair, et 1'exercise, et qu'ils seront loges dans des barraques aussi spatieuses et aussi commodes, que le sont celles des troupes de la puissance au pouvoir de laquelle se trouvent les prisonniers; que cette puissance fera pourvoir journellement les officiers d'autant de rations, composes des memes articles et de la meme qualite, dont jouissent en nature ou en equivalent les officiers du meme rang, qui sont a son propre service, qu'elle fournira egalement a tous les autres prisonniers, une ration paredle a celle

And it is declared, that neither the pretence, that war dissolves all treaties, nor any other whatever shall be considered as annulling or suspending this and the next preceding article; but on the contrary that the state of war is precisely that for which they are provided, and during which they are to be as sacredly observed as the most acknowledged articles

qui est accordee au soldat de sa propre armee. Le montant de ces depenses sera paye par 1'autre puissance, d'apres une liquidation de compte, a arreter reciproquement pour 1'entretien des prisonniers a la fin de la guerre, et ces comptes ne seront point confondus, ou balances avec d'autres comptes, ni la solde qui en est due, retenue, comme compensation, ou represailles, pour tel autre article, ou telle autre pretension reelle, ou supposee.

Les deux puissances contractantes ont declares en outre, que ni le pretexte que la guerre rompt les traites, ni tel autre motif quelconque, ne sera cense annuller, ou suspendre cet article, et le precedent, mais qu'au contraire le terns de la guerre est precisement celui pour lequel ils ont ete stipules, et durant lequel ils seront observes aussi saintement, que les articles les plus universellement reconnus par le droit de la nature et des gens.

APPENDIX. PROCLAMATION. No. 9.

No. 9. Suspending, as to St. Domingo, the Restraints of the Act of 1799, ch. 2.
June 26, 1799. BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
A PROCLAMATION.

Preamble. 1799, ch.2,4. Vol. i. p.615 
Restraints suspended as to Island of St. Domingo under certain regulations.

Whe rea s by an act of the Congress of the United States, passed the ninth day of February last, entitled " An act further to suspend the commercial intercourse between the United States and France, and the dependencies thereof," it is provided,"That at any time after the passing of this act, it shall be lawful for the President of the United States, if he shall deem it expedient and consistent with the interests of the United States, by his order, to remit and discontinue for the time being, the restraints and prohibitions by the said act imposed, either with respect to the French Republic, or to any island, port or place, belonging to the said Republic, with which a commercial intercourse may safely be renewed ; and also to revoke such order whenever in his opinion the interest of the United States shall require ; and he is authorized to make proclamation thereof accordingly.
And whereas the arrangements which have been made at St. Domingo for the safety of the commerce of the United States, and for the admission of American vessels into certain ports of that island, do in my opinion, render it expedient and for the interest of the United States to renew a commercial intercourse with such ports.
Therefore, I, JOHN ADAMS, President of the United States, by virtue of the powers vested in me by the above recited act, do hereby remit and discontinue the restraints and prohibitions therein contained, within the limits and under the regulations here following, to wit:
1. It shall be lawful for vessels which have departed or may depart from the United States, to enter the ports of Cape Francois, and Port Republicain, formerly called Port-au-Prince, in the said Island of St. Domingo, on and after the first day of August next.
2. No vessel shall be cleared for any other port in St. Domingo, than Cape Francois and Port Republicain.
3. It shall be lawful for vessels which shall enter the said ports of Cape Francois and Port Republicain, after the thirty-first day of July next, to depart from thence to any other port in said island between Monte Christi on the North, and Petit Goave on the West: provided it be done with the consent of the government of St. Domingo, and pursuant to certificates or passports expressing such consent, signed by the Consul-General of the United States, or Consul residing at the port of departure.
4. All vessels sailing in contravention of these regulations, will be out of the protection of the United States, and be moreover liable to capture, seizure, and confiscation.

Given under my hand and the Seal of the United States, at Philadelphia,

No. 8. Respecting Resistance in Pennsylvania to the Laws levying Taxes.

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. March 12,1799.

A PROCLAMATION.

Wher eas combinations to defeat the execution of the laws for the valuation Preamble reof the lands and dwelling-houses within the United States, have existed in the citing the fact counties of Northampton, Montgomery, and Bucks, in the State of Pennsyl- of combinations to resist the laws. vania, and have proceeded in a manner subversive of the just authority of the government, by misrepresentations to render the law odious, by deterring the public officers of the United States to forbear the execution of their functions,
and by openly threatening their lives: And whereas the endeavors of the wellaffected citizens, as well as of the executive officers, to conciliate a compliance with those laws, have failed of success, and certain persons in the county of Northampton aforesaid, have been hardy enough to perpetrate certain acts, which I am advised amount to treason, being overt acts of levying war against the United States, the said persons exceeding one hundred in number, and armed and arrayed in a warlike manner, having, on the seventh day of this present month of March, proceeded to the house of Abraham Lovering, in the town of Bethlehem, and there compelled William Nichols, Marshal of the United States, in and for the District of Pennsylvania, to desist from the execution of certain legal process in his hands to be executed, and having compelled him to dischargeand set at liberty certain persons whom he had arrested by virtue of criminal process duly issued for offences against the United States, and having impeded and prevented the Commissioner and the Assessors, appointed in conformity with the laws aforesaid, in the county of Northampton, aforesaid, by threats and personal injury from executing the said laws, avowing as the motives of these illegal and treasonable proceedings, an intention to prevent, by force of arms, the execution of the said laws, and to withstand, by open violence, the lawful authority of the government of the United States : And whereas by the Constitution and Laws of the United States, I am authorized, whenever the laws of the United States shall be opposed or the execution thereof obstructed, in any State, by combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings or by the powers vested in the Marshals, to call forth military force to suppress such combinations, and to cause the laws to be duly executed: And whereas it is in my judgment necessary to call forth military force in order to suppress the combinations aforesaid, and to cause the laws aforesaid to be duly executed : And I have accordingly determined so to do, under the solemn conviction that the essential interests of the United States demand it: Wherefore, I, JOHN ADAMS, President of the United States, Insurgents do hereby command all persons being insurgents as aforesaid, and all others commanded to whom it may concern, on or before Monday next, being the eighteenth day of disperse. this present month, to disperse and retire peaceably to their respective abodes ; and I do moreover warn all persons whomsoever against aiding, abetting, or comforting the perpetrators of the aforesaid treasonable acts; and I do require
all officers and others, good and faithful citizens, according to their respective duties and the laws of the land, to exert their utmost endeavours to prevent and suppress such dangerous and unlawful proceedings.

In testimony whereof, I have caused the Seal of the United States of

America to be affixed to these presents, and signed the same with

[l . s .]

my hand. Done at the City of Philadelphia, the twelfth day of March, in the year of our Lord, one thousand seven hundred and

ninety-nine, and of the independence of the said United States of

America the twenty-third. By the Presi den t :
