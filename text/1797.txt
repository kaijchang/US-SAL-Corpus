Wher eas , a sufficient quorum of judges did not attend to hold the circuit court, for the district of North Carolina, for the purpose of doing business in June term, one thousand seven hundred and ninety-seven; in consequence whereof, certain provisions are now become necessary and expedient, to prevent a failure of justice in the said court:

_______________ ____________

A transcript of the books of the Treasury to be evidence.
Original contract to be produced in certain cases.

(a) The decisions of the courts of the United States on Treasury statements, transcripts and documents,
have been: An account stated at the treasury department, which does not arise in the ordinary mode of doing
business in that department, can derive no additional validity from being certified under the act of Congress. A treasury statement can only be regarded as establishing items for moneys disbursed through the ordinary channels of the department, where the transactions are shown by its books. In these cases the officers may well certify, for they must have official knowledge of the facts stated. United States v. Buford, 3 Peters, 29.
But when moneys come into the hands of an individual, not through the officers of the treasury, or in the regular course of official duty, the books of the treasury do not exhibit the facts, nor can they be officially known to the officers of the department. In such a case the claim of the United States for money thus in the hands of a third person must be established, not by a treasury statement, but by the
evidence on which that statement was made. Ibid. Action of debt on a bond executed by Alpha Kingsley, a paymaster in the army, and by John Smith, T.
and another, as his sureties, to the United States. The condition of the obligation was, that Alpha Kingsley, " about to be appointed a district paymaster," &c. "and who will, from time to time, be charged with funds to execute and perform the duties of that station, for which he will be held accountable," &c. shall "well and truly execute the duties of district paymaster, and regularly account for all moneys placed in his hands to carry into effect the object of his appointment." On the trial the plaintiff gave in evidence a duly certified copy of the bond, and a "transcript from the books and proceedings of the treasury department, of the account of Alpha Kingsley, late district paymaster, in account with the United States." In this account A. K. was charged with moneys advanced to him for pay, subsistence, and forage, bounties and premiums, and contingent expenses of the army; and credited with disbursements of the same, for the purposes for which they were paid to him, and showing a large amount of items suspended and disallowed; making a balance due to the United States of forty-eight thousand four hundred and ninety-two dollars and fifty-three cents. The account was thus settled by the third auditor of the treasury, and was duly certified to the second comptroller of the treasury, and this balance was by him admitted and certified on the 23d of April, 1823. The account was further certified, " Treasury department, third auditor's office, 1st of September, 1824: pursuant to an act to provide for the prompt settlement of public accounts, approved 3d of March, 1817, I, Peter Hagner, third auditor, &c. do hereby certify that the foregoing transcripts are true copies of the originals, on file in this office." To this was annexed a certificate that Peter Hagner was the third auditor, &c. " In testimony whereof I, William H. Crawford, secretary of the treasury, have hereunto subscribed my name, and caused to be affixed the seal of this department, at the city of Washington, this 1st of September, 1824. (Signed) Edward Jones, chief clerk, for William H. Crawford, secretary of the treasury." The seal of the treasury department was affixed to the certificate. On the trial, the district court of Missouri instructed the jury, that "as by the account it appears there are in it items of debit and credit to Kingsley, as district paymaster, it furnished evidence of his having acted as district paymaster, and of his appointment as such." By the court--There are two kinds of transcript which the statute authorizes the proper officers to certify : first, a transcript from "the books and proceedings of the treasury," and secondly, "copies of bonds, contracts, and other papers, &c., which remain on file, and relate to the settlement." The certificate under the first head has been literally made in this case, and is a sufficient authentication of the transcript from "the books and proceedings of the treasury," and is a substantial compliance with the requisitions of the statute. Smith v. The United States, 5 Peters, 292.
Nothing done at the treasury, which did not fall within the scope of the authority of the accounting officers, in settling accounts, can be received in evidence. In the case of the United States v. Buford, 3 Peters, 29, it was held by the supreme court, that an account stated at the treasury department, which does not arise in the ordinary mode of doing business in that department, can derive no additional validity from being certified under the act of Congress. Such statements at the treasury can only be regarded as establishing items for moneys disbursed through the ordinary channels of the department,when the transactions are shown by its books. Cox and Dick v. The United States, 6 Peters, 202.
A treasury transcript, produced in evidence by the United States, in an action on a bond for the performance of a contract for the supply of rations to the troops of the United States, contained items of charge which were not objected to by the defendant. The defendant objected to the following items, as not proved by the transcript: "February 19, 1818, for warrant 1680, favour of Richard Smith, dated December 27, 1817, and February 11, 1818, twenty thousand dollars." And on the 11th of April, of the same year, another charge was made " for warrant No. 1904, for the payment of his two drafts, favour of

Judgment to be rendered at return term, except in certain cases.

Sec . 3. And be it further enacted, That where suit shah be instituted against any person or persons indebted to the United States, as aforesaid, it shall be the duty of the court where the same may be pending, to grant judgment at the return term, upon motion, unless the de-

Alexander M'Cormick, dated March 11, and 17, 1811, for ten thousand dollars." And on the 14th of May, of the same year, a charge was made " for warrant No. 2038, being in part for a bill of exchange in favour of Richard Smith, for twenty thousand dollars, twelve thousand eight hundred and thirty-two dollars and seventy-eight cents." And one other warrant was charged June 22d, "for a bill of exchange in favour of Richard Smith, dated June 22, 1810, four thousand dollars; and also a warrant to Richard Smith, per order, for eight thousand dollars." These items, the circuit court instructed the jury, were not sufficiently proved, by being charged in the account, and certified under the act of Congress. By the Court--The officers of the treasury may well certify facts which come under their official notice, but they cannot certify those which do not come within their own knowledge. The execution of bills of exchange and orders for money on the treasury, though they may be " connected with the settlement of an account," cannot be officially known to the accounting officers. In such cases, however, provision has been made by law, by which such instruments are made evidence, without proof of the handwriting of the drawer. The act of Congress of the 3d of March, 1797, makes all copies of papers relating to the settlement of accounts at the treasury, properly certified, when produced in court annexed to the transcript, of equal validity with the originals. Under this provision, had copies of the bills of exchange and orders, on which these items were paid to Smith and M`Cormick, been duly certified and annexed to the transcript, the same effect must have been given to them by the circuit court, as if the original had been produced and proved. And every transcript of accounts from the treasury, which contains items of payments made to others, on the authority of the person charged, should have annexed to it a duly certified copy of the instrument which authorized such payments. And so, in every case, where the government endeavours by suit, to hold an individual liable for acts of his agent. The agency, on which the act of the government was founded, should be made to appear by a duly certified copy of the power. The defendant would be at liberty to impeach the evidence thus certified ; and, under peculiar circumstances of alleged fraud, a court might require the production of the original instrument. This, however, would depend upon the exercise of the discretion of the court, and could only be enforced by a continuance of the cause until the original should be produced. United States v. Jones, 8 Peters, 375.
The following item in the treasury transcript was not admissible in evidence: " To accounts transferred from the books of the second auditor for this sum, standing to his debit, under said contract, on the books of the second auditor, transferred to his debit on those of this officer, forty-five thousand dollars." The act of Congress, in making a " transcript from the books and proceedings of the treasury" evidence, does not mean the statement of an account in gross, but a statement of the items, both of the debits and credits, as they were acted upon by the accounting officers of the department. On the trial, the defendant shall be allowed no credit on vouchers, which have not been rejected by the treasury officers, unless it was not in his power to have produced them ; and how could a proper effect be given to this provision, if the credits be charged in gross ? The defendant is unquestionably entitled to a detailed statement of the items which compose his account. Ibid.
The defendant, in an action by the United States, where a treasury transcript is produced in evidence by the plaintiffs, is entitled to the credits given to him in the account; and in claiming those credits, he does not waive any objection to the items on the debit side of the account. He is unquestionably entitled to the evidence of the decision of the treasury officers upon his vouchers, without reference to the charges made against him. And he may avail himself of that decision, without, in any degree, restricting his right to object to any improper charge. The credits were allowed the defendant on the vouchers alone, and without reference to the particular items of demand which the government might have against him. And the debits, as well as the credits, must be established on distinct and legal evidence. Ibid.
The law has prescribed the mode by which treasury accounts shall be made evidence, and whilst an individual may claim the benefit of this rule, the government can set up no exemption from its operation. In the performance of their official duty, the treasury officers act under the authority of law; their acts are public, and affect the rights of individuals as well as those of the government. In the adjustment of an account, they sometimes act judicially, and their acts are all recorded on the books and files of the treasury department. So far as they act strictly within the rules prescribed for the exercise of their powers, their decisions are, in effect, final; for if an appeal be made, they will receive judicial sanction. Accounts, amounting to many millions annually, come under the action of these officers. It is, therefore, of great importance to the public, and to individuals, that the rules by which they exercise their powers, should be fixed and known. Ibid.
In every treasury account on which suit is brought, the law requires the credits to be stated as well as the debits. These credits the officers of the government cannot properly either suppress or withhold. They are made evidence in the case, and were designed by the law for the benefit of the defendant. Ibid.
O. made a contract with the government to supply the troops of the United States with rations within a certain district, and executed a bond and contract agreeably to the usages of the war department. The United States brought an action against 0. on the bond, and gave in evidence the contract annexed to the bond, and a treasury statement, which showed a balance against 0. The United States also gave in evidence another transcript to prove that 0., under a previous account, had been paid a balance of nineteen thousand one hundred and forty-nine dollars and one cent, stated to be due to him, which was paid to his agent, under power of attorney, and the receipt for the same endorsed on the back of the account. The circuit court instructed the jury, that the second transcript was not evidence, per se, to establish the items charged to O. Held, that there was no error in this instruction. United States v. Jones, 8 Peters, 387.
The circuit court, on the prayer of the defendant, instructed the jury, that the transcript from the books and proceedings of the treasury, can only be regarded as establishing such of the items of debit, in the account stated in the said transcript, as are for moneys disbursed through the ordinary channels of the treasury department, where the transactions are shown by its books, and where the officers of the department must have had official knowledge of the facts stated: but that the transcript is evidence for the

fendant shall, in open court, (the United States attorney being present) make oath or affirmation, that he is equitably entitled to credits which had been, previous to the commencement of the suit, submitted to the consideration of the accounting officers of the treasury, and rejected; specifying each particular claim, so rejected in the affidavit; and that he cannot then come safely to trial. Oath or affirmation to this effect being made, subscribed and filed, if the court be thereupon satisfied, a continuance, until the next succeeding term, may be granted; but not otherwise, unless as provided in the preceding section.
Sec . 4. And be it further enacted, That in suits between the United States and individuals, no claim for a credit shall be admitted, upon trial, but such as shall appear to have been presented to the accounting officers of the treasury, for their examination, and by them disallowed, in whole or in part, unless it should be proved, to the satisfaction of the court, that the defendant is, at the time of trial, in possession of vouchers not before in his power to procure, and that he was prevented from exhibiting a claim for such credit, at the treasury, by absence from the
United States, or some unavoidable accident. Sec . 5. And be it further enacted, That where any revenue officer,

defendant of the full amount of the credits therein stated ; and that, by relying on the said transcript, as evidence of such credits, the defendant does not admit the correctness of any of the debits in the said account, of which the transcript is not, per se, evidence ; and that the said transcript is not, per se, evidence of any of the items of debit therein stated, except the first. By the Court--The correctness of the principle laid down by the circuit court in this instruction, has been recognized by the supreme court, in a case between the same parties, at the present term.

The auditor's report of a balance due from a person accountable for public money, is a guide to the comptroller as to the amount to be sued for, but not evidence for the court of the debt. United States v. Patterson, Gilpin's D. C. R. 47.
Where the public officers are authorized by law to certify to certain facts, their certificates to these facts are competent evidence thereof. Gass v. Stinson, 2 Sumner's C. C. R. 605.
A certified statement of a balance due, and the report thereof to the comptroller, is not such a transcript from the books and proceedings of the treasury as may be given in evidence under the 2d section of the act of March 3, 1797. United States v. Patterson, Gilpin's D. C. R. 47.
The letters and transactions between the officers of the government, and a debtor to the United States, relative to his account, may be given in evidence under a plea of payment. United States v. Beattie,
Gilpin's D. C. R. 97. The certificate of the register of the treasury department, under his hand, that certain receipts, of
which copies are annexed, are on file in his office, with a certificate of the secretary of the treasury, under the seal of the department, that he is register; is not evidence. It must appear not only that the officer who gives the certificate, has the custody of the papers, but that he is authorized by law to certify them, and the register is not so authorized; a sworn copy should have been produced. -Bleecker v. Bond,
3 Wash. C. C. R. 529. At the treasury department, a general account had been kept with the collector or the customs from the
time of his appointment; during which, different bonds had been given to the United States for each term of office. Afterwards, a statement of the account of the collector for one term of office was made out, and a transcript of their accounts was offered in evidence. The evidence was legal. The United States v.

God is infinite. Unde r the auspices of the greatest, the most powerful of all the Princes of the Ottoman nation who reign upon the earth, our most glorious and most august Emperor, who commands the two lands and the two seas, Selim Kan, the victorious son of the Sultan Moustafa, whose realm may God prosper until the end of ages, the support of Kings, the Seal of Justice, the Emperor of Emperors. The most illustrious and most magnificent Prince, Hamouda Pacha, Bey, who commands the Odgiak of Tunis, the abode of happiness, and the most honored Ibrahim Dey, and Soliman, aga of the Janissaries, and chief of the Divan, and all the elders of the Odgiak; and the most distinguished and honored President of the Congress of the United States of America, the most distinguished among those who profess the religion of the Messiah, of whom may the end be happy. We have concluded between us the present treaty of peace and friendship, all the articles of which have been framed by the intervention of Joseph Stephen Famin, French merchant residing at Tunis, charge d'affaires of the United States of America; which stipulations and conditions are comprised in twenty-three articles, written and expressed in such manner as to leave no doubt of their contents, and in such way as not to be contravened.
Art. I. There shall be a perpetual and constant peace between the United States of America, and the magnificent Pacha, Bey of Tunis; and also a permanent friendship, which shall more and more increase.
Art. II. If a vessel of war of the two nations shall make prize of an enemy's vessel, in which may be found effects, property and subjects of the two contracting parties, the whole shall be restored : the Bey shall restore the property and subjects of the United States, and the latter shall make a reciprocal restoration; it being understood on both sides, that the just right to what is claimed shall be proved.
Art. III. Merchandise belonging to any nation which may be at war with one of the contracting parties, and loaded on board of the vessels of the other, shall pass without molestation, and without any attempt being made to capture or detain it.
Art. IV. On both sides sufficient passports shall be given to vessels, that they may be known and treated as friendly; and considering the distance between the two countries, a term of eighteen months is given, within which term respect shall be paid to the said passports, without requiring the conge or document (which at Tunis is called testa) but after the said term the conge shall he presented.
Art. V. If the corsairs of Tunis shall meet at sea with ships of war of the United States, having under their escort merchant vessels of their

Fugitive slaves and prisoners.

nation, they shall not be searched or molested; and in such case the commanders shall be believed upon their word, to exempt their ships from being visited and to avoid quarantine : The American ships of war shall act in like manner towards merchant vessels escorted by the corsairs of Tunis.
Art. VI. If a Tunisian corsair shall meet with an American merchant vessel, and shall visit it with her boat, she shall not exact any thing, under pain of being severely punished: And in like manner if a vessel of war of the United States shall meet with a Tunisian merchant vessel, she shall observe the same rule. In case a slave shall take refuge on board of an American vessel of war, the consul shall be required to cause him to be restored; and if any of their prisoners shall escape on board of the Tunisian vessels, they shall be restored : But if any slave shall take refuge in any American merchant vessel, and it shall be proved that the vessel has departed with the said slave, then he shall be returned, or his ransom shall be paid.

Prize vessels purchased at Tunis, how to obtain temporary passports.

Art. VII. An American citizen having purchased a prize-vessel from our Odgiak, may sail with our passport, which we will deliver for the term of one year; by force of which our corsairs which may meet with her shall respect her; the consul on his part shall furnish her with a bill of sale; and considering the distance of the two countries, this term shall suffice to obtain a passport in form : But after the expiration of this term, if our corsairs shall meet with her without the passport of the United States, she shall be stopped and declared good prize, as well the vessel as the cargo and crew.

Hospitality to be granted to vessels entering the ports of the parties.

Art. VIII. If a vessel of one of the contracting parties shall be obliged to enter into a port of the other, and may have need of provisions and other articles, they shall be granted to her without any difficulty, at the price-current at the place; and if such a vessel shall have suffered at sea, and shall have need of repairs, she shall be at liberty to unload, and re-load her cargo without being obliged to pay any duty; and the captain shall only be obliged to pay the wages of those whom he shall have employed in loading and unloading the merchandise.

Assistance to be granted to wrecked vessels.
Neutrality of ports to be enforced.

Art. IX. If by accident and by the permission of God, a vessel of one of the contracting parties shall be cast by tempest upon the coasts of the other, and shall be wrecked, or otherwise damaged, the commandant of the place shall render all possible assistance for its preservation, without allowing any person to make any opposition; and the proprietor of the effects shall pay the costs of salvage to those who may have been employed.
Art. X. In case a vessel of one of the contracting parties shall be attacked by an enemy under the cannon of the forts of the other party, she shall be defended and protected as much as possible; and when she shall set sail, no enemy shall be permitted to pursue her from the same port, or any other neighboring port, for forty-eight hours after her departure.

Salutes.

Art. XI. When a vessel of war of the United States of America shall enter the port of Tunis, and the consul shall request that the castle may salute her, the number of guns shall be fired which he may request: and if the said consul does not want a salute, there shall be no question about it.
But in case he shall desire the salute, and the number of guns shall be fired which he may have requested, they shall be counted and returned by the vessel in as many barrels of cannon powder.
The same shall be done with respect to the Tunisian corsairs when they shall enter any port of the United States.

TREATY WITH TUNIS. 1797.

159

Art. XII. When citizens of the United States shall come within the dependencies of Tunis, to carry on commerce there, the same respect shall be paid to them which the merchants of other nations enjoy; and if they wish to establish themselves within our ports, no opposition shall be made thereto; and they shall be free to avail themselves of such interpreters as they may judge necessary, without any obstruction, in conformity with the usages of other nations; and if a Tunisian subject shall go to establish himself within the dependencies of the United
States, he shall be treated in like manner. If any Tunisian subject shall freight an American vessel and load
her with merchandise, and shall afterwards want to unlade or ship them on board of another vessel, we will not permit him, until the matter is
determined by a reference of merchants, who shall decide upon the case; and after the decision, the determination shall be conformed to.
No captain shall be detained in port against his consent, except when our ports are shut for the vessels of all other nations, which may take
place with respect to merchant vessels, but not to those of war. The subjects of the two contracting powers shall be under the pro-
tection of the Prince, and under the jurisdiction of the Chief of the place where they may be, and no other person shall have authority over
them. If the commandant of the place does not conduct himself agreeably to justice, a representation of it shall be made to us.
In case the government shall have need of an American merchant vessel, it shall cause it to be freighted, and then a suitable freight shall be paid to the captain agreeably to the intention of the government, and
the captain shall not refuse it.

Privileges of merchants.
Tunisian subject freighting an American vessel, &c. Embargoes. Protection of the subjects of the parties. Government of Tunis may freight American vessels.

Art. XIII. If among the crews of merchant vessels of the United States, there shall be found subjects of our enemies, they shall not be made slaves, on condition that they do not exceed a third of the crew; and when they do exceed a third, they shall be made slaves: The present article only concerns the sailors, and not the passengers, who shall
not be in any manner molested.

Enemy's subjects on board the vessels of the parties,--in what case they shall be made slaves.

Art. XIV. A Tunisian merchant, who may go to America with a vessel of any nation soever, loaded with merchandise which is the production of the kingdom of Tunis, shall pay duty (small as it is) like the merchants of other nations; and the American merchants shall equally pay for the merchandise of their country, which they may bring to Tunis under their flag, the same duty as the Tunisians pay in Ame-
rica. But if an American merchant, or a merchant of any other nation,
shall bring American merchandise under any other flag, he shall pay six per cent, duty: In like manner, if a foreign merchant shall bring the merchandise of his country under the American flag, he shall also
pay six per cent.
Art. XV. It shall be free for the citizens of the United States to carry on what commerce they please in the kingdom of Tunis, without any opposition, and they shall be treated like the merchants of other nations; but they shall not carry on commerce in wine, nor in prohibited articles: And if any one shall be detected in a contraband trade, he shall be punished according to the laws of the country. The commandants of ports and castles shall take care, that the captains and sailors shall not load prohibited articles; but if this should happen, those who shall not have contributed to the smuggling shall not be molested nor searched, no more than shall the vessel and cargo; but only the offender, who shall be demanded to be punished. No captain shall be obliged to receive merchandise on board his vessel, nor to unlade the same against his will, until the freight shall be paid.

Duties to be reciprocally paid.
Liberty of commerce, contraband excepted.
Privileges of masters of vessels.

160

TREATY WITH TUNIS. 1797.

Duty of anchorage.
Right ofhaving a Consul, and his privileges.

Art. XVI. The merchant vessels of the United States which shall cast anchor in the road of the Gouletta, or any other port of the kingdom of Tunis, shall be obliged to pay the same anchorage for entry and departure which French vessels pay, to wit: Seventeen piasters and a half, money of Tunis, for entry, if they import merchandise; and the same for departure, if they take away a cargo; but they shall not be obliged to pay anchorage if they arrive in ballast, and depart in the same manner.
Art. XVII. Each of the contracting parties shall be at liberty to establish a consul in the dependencies of the other; and if such consul does not act in conformity with the usages of the country, like others, the government of the place shall inform his government of it, to the end that he may be changed and replaced; but he shall enjoy, as well for himself as his family and suite, the protection of the government: And he may import for his own use all his provisions and furniture without paying any duty; and if he shall import merchandise (which it shall be lawful for him to do) he shall pay duty for it.

No responsibility for subjects contracting debts, &c. Administration of the effects of a decedent.
Consul's jurisdiction over his countrymen. Punishment or personal assaults, committed by the subjects of one party upon those of the other.

Art. XVIII. If the subjects or citizens of either of the contracting parties, being within the possessions of the other, contract debts, or enter into obligations, neither the consul nor the nation, nor any subjects or citizens thereof shall be in any manner responsible, except they or the consul shall have previously become bound in writing: And without this obligation in writing, they cannot be called upon for indemnity or satisfaction.
Art. XIX. In case of a citizen or subject of either of the contracting parties dying within the possesions of the other, the consul or the vekil shall take possession of his effects, (if he does not leave a will) of which he shall make an inventory; and the government of the place shall have nothing to do therewith. And if there shall be no consul, the effects shall be deposited in the hands of a confidential person of the place, taking an inventory of the whole, that they may eventually be delivered to those to whom they of right belong.
Art. XX. The consul shall be the judge in all disputes between his fellow citizens or subjects, as also between all other persons who may be immediately under his protection; and in all cases wherein he shall require the assistance of the government where he resides to sanction his decisions, it shall be granted to him.
Art. XXI. If a citizen or subject of one of the parties shall kill, wound, or strike a citizen or subject of the other, justice shall be done according to the laws of the country where the offence shall be committed : The consul shall be present at the trial; but if any offender shall escape, the consul shall be in no manner responsible for it.
Art. XXII. If a dispute or law-suit on commercial or other civil matters shall happen, the trial shall be had in the presence of the consul, or of a confidential person of his choice, who shall represent him, and endeavor to accommodate the difference which may have happened between the citizens or subjects of the two nations.

In case of national differences, accommodation to be attempted before recourse is had to arms.

Art. XXIII. If any difference or dispute shall take place concerning the infraction of any article of the present treaty on either side, peace and good harmony shall not be interrupted, until a friendly application shall have been made for satisfaction; and resort shall not be had to arms therefor, except where such application shall have been rejected; and if war be then declared, the term of one year shall be allowed to the citizens or subjects of the contracting parties to arrange their affairs, and to withdraw themselves with their property.
