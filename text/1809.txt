Sec . 2. And be it further enacted, That it shall not be lawful to put on board any ship, vessel, or boat of any description whatever, any specie or goods, wares or merchandise, either of domestic or foreign growth, produce, or manufacture, and the same is hereby prohibited, unless a permit particularly stating the articles thus to be laden shall have been previously obtained from the collector of the district, in which such ship, vessel, or boat may then be, or from a revenue officer specially authorized by the collector to grant such permits; nor unless the lading shall be made under the inspection of the proper revenue officers, nor unless the owner or owners, consignee or factor of such ship, vessel, or boat shall, with the master, have given bond with one or more sureties to the United States, in a sum six times the value of the vessel and cargo, that the vessel shall not leave the port without a clearance, nor shall, when leaving the port, proceed to a foreign port or place, nor shall put any article on board of any other vessel; and that the whole cargo shall be relanded either in the port where the vessel may then be, or in such other port of the United States as shall be designated in the clearance.

vessel, or boat and cargo shall be wholly forfeited: but the collectors are hereby authorized to order or to cause the cargoes of such vessels to be discharged for the same causes as they may refuse permission to put any cargo on board of vessels not yet laden in whole or in part. And they
are likewise authorized in the mean while, and until the cargoes shall have been discharged, or bonds given, as the case may be, to take possession of such vessels, and to take such other measures as may be necessary to prevent their departure.
Sec . 4. And be it further enacted, That the collectors of the customs be, and they are hereby authorized to grant, under such general instructions as the President of the United States may give to that effect, a general permission to ships, vessels or boats, whose employment has uniformly been confined to the navigation of bays, sounds, rivers, or lakes within the jurisdiction of the United States, when it can be done without danger of the embargo being violated, to take on board at any time such articles of domestic or foreign growth as may be designated in such general permission or permissions, bond with one or more sureties being previously given to the United States by the owner, owners, con-
signee or factors of such ship, vessel, or boat, and by the master thereof, in an amount equal to three hundred dollars for each ton of the said vessel, that such vessel shall not, during the time limited in the condition of the bond, depart from any district of the United States, without having previously obtained a clearance, nor until the master or commander shall have delivered to the collector or surveyor of the port of departure a manifest of the whole cargo on board, that the said vessel shall not during the time above mentioned, proceed to any other port than that mentioned in her clearance, or put any article on board of any other vessel, or be employed in any foreign trade; and that on every voyage or trip, the whole of the cargo shall be landed in a port of the United States within the bay, sound, rivers or lakes, to which the navigation of such vessel is confined.
Sec . 5.

shall be construed to extend to the owner or owners of any ship or vessel who shall have made a bona fide sale of such ship or vessel, in any port or harbor of the United States, before notice of this act at such port or
harbor, respectively ; nor to the owner or owners of any ship or vessel, in any foreign port or place, who shall have made a bona fide sale thereof, before notice of this act: And provided also, that such bond shall not release the owners and master of such ship or vessel, or any other person from the obligation of giving every other bond required by this act or by any of the acts aforesaid.
Sec . 7. And be it further enacted, That in all cases where, either under this act, or under the act laying an embargo on all ships or vessels in the ports and harbors of the United States, or under any of the acts supplementary thereto, a bond has been or shall be given to the United States, with condition that certain goods, wares, and merchandise, or the cargo of a vessel shall be relanded in some port of the United States, the party or parties to such bond shall, within two months after the date

But neither capture, distress, or any other accident whatever shall be pleaded or given in evidence in any such suit: Unless such capture shall be expressly proved to have been hostile, and such distress or accident occasioned by no negligence or deviation, nor unless such vessel shall have been from the commencement of the voyage wholly navigated by a
master, mate or mates, mariners and crew, all of whom shall be citizens

And in every suit instituted on a bond, given as aforesaid, the defendants shall pay all costs, if they shall not within the limited time have produced the certifi-
cate of relanding to the collector of the proper port. Sec . 8. And be it further enacted, That no registered or sea letter
vessel, although in ballast, shall receive a clearance, or be permitted to depart from any port of the United States, unless the same bond shall have been previously given which is required from vessels licensed for the coasting trade, before they are allowed to depart. And if any such ship or vessel shall depart without bond having been given as aforesaid, the said ship or vessel shall be forfeited ; and the owner, owners, agent, consignee, factor and master or commander of such ship or vessel, as well as any other person concerned in such prohibited departure, shall be liable to the same penalties imposed by law in the case of vessels licensed for the coasting trade departing without bond having been
given, or without clearance, as aforesaid. Sec . 9. And be it further enacted, That the collectors of all the dis-
tricts of the United States shall, and they are hereby authorized to take into their custody specie or any articles of domestic growth, produce, or manufacture, found on board of any ship or vessel, boat or other water craft, when there is reason to believe that they are intended for exportation, or when in vessels, carts, wagons, sleighs, or any other carriage, or in any manner apparently on their way towards the territories of a foreign nation, or the vicinity thereof, or towards a place whence such articles are intended to be exported; and not to permit such articles to be removed, until bond with sufficient sureties shall have been given for the landing or delivery of the same in some place of the United States, whence, in the opinion of the collector, there shall not be any danger
