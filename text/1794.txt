(a) The acts prohibiting and punishing the Slave trade, are : An act to prohibit the carrying on the slave trade from the United States to any foreign place or country, March 22, 1794, chap. 11 ; an act in addition to the act entitled, " An act to prohibit the carrying on the slave trade from the United States to any foreign place or country," May 10, 1800 ; an act to prevent the introduction of certain persons into certain states, where by the laws thereof their admission is prohibited, February 28, 1803, chap. 10; an act to prohibit the importation of slaves into any port or place within the jurisdiction of the United States from and after the first of January one thousand eight hundred and eight, March 2, 1807, chap. 22 ; an act in addition to an act entitled, "An act to prohibit the importation of slaves within the jurisdiction of the United States from and after the first day of January one thousand eight hundred and eight," April 20, 1818, chap. 86 ; an act to continue in force " an act to protect the commerce of the United States, and punish the crime of piracy," and also to make further provision for punishing the crime of piracy, May 15, 1820, chap. 112, sec. 4, 5.
Decisions of the Courts of the United States on the acts prohibiting and punishing the Slave Trade.--A libel or information under the 9th section of the slave trade act of March 2, 1797, alleging that the vessel sailed from the port of New York and Perth Amboy, without the captain having delivered the manifest required by law, to the collector or surveyor of the portof New York and Perth Amboy, is defective; the act requiring the manifest to be delivered to the collector or surveyor of a single port. The Mary Ann, 8 Wheat. 380; 5 Cond. Rep. 471.
Under the same section, the libel must charge the vessel to be of the burthen of forty tons or more. In general it is sufficient to charge the offence in the words directing the forfeiture. But if the words are general, embracing a whole class of individual subjects, they must necessarily be so construed as to embrace only a subdivision of that class ; the allegation must conform to the legislative sense and meaning.
Ibid. The prohibitions in the slave trade acts of May 10, 1800, and April 20, 1818, extend as well to carry-
ing slaves on freight, as to cases where the persons transported are the property of the United States; and the carrying of them from one port to another of the same foreign empire, as well as from one foreign country to another. The Merino, 9 Wheat. 391 ; 5 Cond. Rep. 623.
Under the 4th section of the act of May 10, 1800, the owner of the slaves transported contrary to the provisions of that act, cannot claim the same in a court of the United States, although, according to the laws of his own country, they may be held in servitude. But if at the time of capture by a commissioned vessel, the offending ship was in the possession of a non-commissioned captor, who had made a seizure for the same offence, the owner of the slaves may claim them ; the section only applying to persons interested in the enterprise or voyage in which the ship was employed, at the time of such capture.
Ibid. Under the slave trade act of 1794, sec. 1, it is not necessary, in order to incur the forfeiture, that the
vessel shall be completely fitted and ready for sea. As soon as the preparations have proceeded so far as clearly to manifest the intention, the right of seizure attaches. The Emily and Caroline, 9 Wheat. 381 ; 5 Cond. Rep. 623.
The African slave trade is a trade which has been authorized and protected by the laws of all commercial nations. The right to carry it on has been claimed by each, and exercised by each ; and it therefore cannot be considered as contrary to the laws of nations. The slave trade remains lawful to those nations which have not forbidden it. The Antelope, 10 Wheat. 66 ; 6 Cond. Rep. 30.
If the slave trade is not contrary to the laws of nations, it cannot be piracy, unless so declared by statute ; and the obligations of such statute cannot exceed the power of the state which has enacted it. Ibid.

A. foreign vessel engaged in the slave trade, captured on the high seas, in time of peace, by an American cruiser, and brought in for adjudication, will be restored, even where the vessel belongs to a nation

which has prohibited the trade. Ibid. The right of visitation and search does not exist in time of peace. A vessel engaged in the slave trade
in time of peace, even if belonging to a nation which has prohibited the trade, cannot, for that cause alone, be seized on the high seas, and brought in for adjudication in the courts of another country. But if the laws of that other country be violated, or the proceeding be authorized by treaty, the capture is not

illegal. Ibid.

..

Africans who are first captured by a belligerent privateer, fitted out in violation of our neutrality, or

by a pirate, and then recaptured and brought into the ports of the United States, under a reasonable

suspicion that a violation of the slave trade acts was intended, are not to be restored without full proof

of the proprietary interests; for in such a case the capture is lawful. And whether in such a case resti-

tution ought to be decreed or not, was a question on which the court was equally divided. Ibid.

The District Courts have jurisdiction under the slave trade acts, to determine who are the actual cap -

tors, under a state law made in pursuance of the 4th section of the slave trade act of 1807 ; and direct-

ing the proceeds of the negroes to be paid, " one moiety for the use of the commanding officer of the

capturing vessel," &c. The Josefa Segunda, 10 Wheat. 312; 6 Cond. Rep. 111. Under the 7th section of the slave trade act of 1807, the entire proceeds of the vessel are forfeited to
the use of the United States; unless the seizure be made by armed vessels of the navy, or by revenue cutters ; in which case distribution is to be made in the same manner as prizes taken from the enemy.

Upon an indictment under the slave trade act of April 20, 1818, against the owner of the ship, testimony

of the declarations of the master, being a part of the res gestee, connected with acts in furtherance of the

voyage and within the scope of his authority as the agent of the owner, in the conduct of the guilty enter-

prise, is admissible. Upon such an indictment against the owner, charging him with fitting out the ship,

with an intent to employ her in the illegal voyage, evidence is admissible that her commander authorized,

and directed the fitment through the instrumentality of his agent, without being personally present. The

United States v. Gooding, 12 Wheat. 460; 6 Cond. Rep. 572. It is not essential to constitute the fitting out, under the acts of Congress, that every equipment
necessary for a slave voyage, or any equipment peculiarly adapted to such a voyage, should be taken on board. It is sufficient if the vessel is actually fitted out with intent to be employed in the illegal voyage.

The offence may be laid in the words of the statute. Ibid. Nor is it necessary that there should be some principal offender, to whom the defendant might be aid-
ing and abetting. Those terms in the statute do not refer to the relation of principal and accessory in cases of felony, but to the actor; and they who aid and abet the act, are considered as principals. The offence must be alleged to have been committed within the United States. Ibid.
Under the act of March 22, 1794, prohibiting the slave trade, if the original object and equipment of the voyage from the United States, was to carry on the African slave trade, the forfeiture attaches, whether the vessel was then owned by American citizens or by foreigners. It is equally unimportant if the act was done by the party, suo jure, or for the benefit of another. The Margaret, 9 Wheat. 421; 5 Cond.

Rep. 638. Even if the equipments are innocent, and adapted to ordinary voyages, if there is positive proof of a
guilty intention, forfeiture will attach. Nor is it necessary that the equipments shall have been completed. It is sufficient if any preparations have been made for the unlawful voyage. Ibid.
Under the 2d and 3d sections of the act of April, 1818, the offence of sailing from a port to engage in the slave trade, is not committed unless the vessel sails out of the port. United States v. La Coste, 2

Mason's C. C. R. 129. If a foreign claimant of a vessel seized for being engaged in the slave trade, sets up a title derived
from an American owner, he must prove affirmatively that the case has no admixture of American ownership. United States v. La Jeune Eugenia, 2 Mason's C. C. R. 409.
The 1st section of the slave trade act of May 10, 1800, prohibits not only the transportation of slaves, but the being employed on the business of the slave trade; and therefore a vessel caught in such trade, though before she has taken on board any slaves, is liable to forfeiture. The Alexander, 3 Mason's C.

C. R. 175. The offence against the law of the United States, under the 7th section of the act of March 2, 1807,
is not that of importing or bringing into the United States persons of colour, with intent to hold or sell those persons as slaves, but that of hovering on the coast of the United States with such intent; and although it forfeits the vessel and any goods or effects found on board, it is silent as to disposing of any persons found on board, any further than to impose a duty upon the officers of any armed vessels, who make the capture, to keep them safely, to be delivered to the overseers of the poor, or to the governor of the state, or persons appointed by the respective states to receive them. United States v. Preston, 3 Peters, 65.
Certain persons who were slaves in Louisiana, were, by their owners, taken to France as servants, and after some time, they, by their own consent, were sent back to Louisiana. The ships in which these persons were passengers, were, after the arrival of the vessels in the United States, libelled for alleged breaches of the act of Congress of April 20, 1818, prohibiting the importation of slaves into the United States. Held that the provisions of the act of Congress do not apply to such cases. The United States v. Garonne, 11 Peters, 73.
The act of March 22, 1794, was intended to prohibit any citizen or resident of the United States from equipping vessels within the United States, carrying on trade or traffic in slaves to any foreign country. The Tryphemea, 1 Wash. C. C. R. 522.
The act of May 10, 1800, extends the prohibitions to citizens of the United States, in any manner con-

Sec . 2. And be it further enacted, That all and every person, so building, fitting out, equipping, loading, or otherwise preparing, or sending away, any ship or vessel, knowing or intending that the same shall be employed in such trade or business, contrary to the true intent and meaning of this act, or any ways aiding or abetting therein, shall severally forfeit and pay the sum of two thousand dollars, one moiety thereof to the use of the United States, and the other moiety thereof to the use of him or her who shall sue for and prosecute the same.
Sec . 3. And be it further enacted, That the owner, master or factor of each and every foreign ship or vessel, clearing out for any of the coasts or kingdoms of Africa, or suspected to be intended for the slave trade, and the suspicion being declared to the officer of the customs, by any citizen, on oath or affirmation, and such information being to the satisfaction of the said officer, shall first give bond with sufficient sureties, to the treasurer of the United States, that none of the natives of Africa, or any other foreign country or place, shall be taken on board the said ship or vessel, to be transported, or sold as slaves, in any other foreign port or place whatever, within nine months thereafter.
Sec . 4. And be it further enacted, That if any citizen or citizens of the United States shall, contrary to the true intent and meaning of this act, take on board, receive or transport any such persons, as above described, in this act, for the purpose of selling them as slaves, as aforesaid, he or they shall forfeit and pay, for each and every person, so received on board, transported, or sold as aforesaid, the sum of two hundred dollars, to be recovered in any court of the United States proper to try the same; the one moiety thereof to the use of the United States, and the other moiety to the use of such person or persons, who

The act of Congress declares that " no person shall build, fit, equip, load, or otherwise prepare any ehip or vessel, to sail from any port of the United States, for the purpose of carrying on any trade or traffic in slaves to any foreign country." And it declares that " if any ship or vessel shall be so fitted out as aforesaid, or shall be caused to sail as aforesaid, such ship or vessel shall be forfeited to the United States." And the 2d section inflicts a penalty of two thousand dollars on any person who shall build, fit out, &c., any ship or vessel knowing or intending that the same shall be so employed. Held, 1. That the forfeiture of the vessel is not incurred by the building of the vessel for the illegal purpose aforesaid, but only for the fitting out and causing her to sail as aforesaid. 2. An information against the vessel which charges that " she was built, fitted, equipped, loaded, or otherwise prepared, or caused to sail," &c., is bad for uncertainty as to which of the several offences is charged, and on such information, a forfeiture ought not to be pronounced. The Brig Caroline, 1 Brockenb. C. C. R. 384.
The act of Congress of February 28, 1803, forbidding any master or captain of a ship or vessel, to import or bring into any port of the United States, any negro, mulatto, or person of colour, under certain penalties, where the admission of such persons is prohibited by the laws of such state, does not apply to coloured seamen employed in navigating such ship or vessel. The Brig Wilson, 1 Brockenb. C. C. R. 423.
If under the act of April 22, 1818, sec. 2, 3, the offence of causing a vessel to sail from the United States, with an intent, be alleged in an indictment to be on a day now last past, and on divers days before and since that day, the allegation is sufficient. United States v. La Coste, 2 Mason's C. C. R 129.

ship, &c. concerned in slave trade.

(a) The acts prohibiting and punishing the Slave trade, are : An act to prohibit the carrying on the slave trade from the United States to any foreign place or country, March 22, 1794, chap. 11 ; an act in addition to the act entitled, " An act to prohibit the carrying on the slave trade from the United States to any foreign place or country," May 10, 1800 ; an act to prevent the introduction of certain persons into certain states, where by the laws thereof their admission is prohibited, February 28, 1803, chap. 10; an act to prohibit the importation of slaves into any port or place within the jurisdiction of the United States from and after the first of January one thousand eight hundred and eight, March 2, 1807, chap. 22 ; an act in addition to an act entitled, "An act to prohibit the importation of slaves within the jurisdiction of the United States from and after the first day of January one thousand eight hundred and eight," April 20, 1818, chap. 86 ; an act to continue in force " an act to protect the commerce of the United States, and punish the crime of piracy," and also to make further provision for punishing the crime of piracy, May 15, 1820, chap. 112, sec. 4, 5.
Decisions of the Courts of the United States on the acts prohibiting and punishing the Slave Trade.--A libel or information under the 9th section of the slave trade act of March 2, 1797, alleging that the vessel sailed from the port of New York and Perth Amboy, without the captain having delivered the manifest required by law, to the collector or surveyor of the portof New York and Perth Amboy, is defective; the act requiring the manifest to be delivered to the collector or surveyor of a single port. The Mary Ann, 8 Wheat. 380; 5 Cond. Rep. 471.
Under the same section, the libel must charge the vessel to be of the burthen of forty tons or more. In general it is sufficient to charge the offence in the words directing the forfeiture. But if the words are general, embracing a whole class of individual subjects, they must necessarily be so construed as to embrace only a subdivision of that class ; the allegation must conform to the legislative sense and meaning.
Ibid. The prohibitions in the slave trade acts of May 10, 1800, and April 20, 1818, extend as well to carry-
ing slaves on freight, as to cases where the persons transported are the property of the United States; and the carrying of them from one port to another of the same foreign empire, as well as from one foreign country to another. The Merino, 9 Wheat. 391 ; 5 Cond. Rep. 623.
Under the 4th section of the act of May 10, 1800, the owner of the slaves transported contrary to the provisions of that act, cannot claim the same in a court of the United States, although, according to the laws of his own country, they may be held in servitude. But if at the time of capture by a commissioned vessel, the offending ship was in the possession of a non-commissioned captor, who had made a seizure for the same offence, the owner of the slaves may claim them ; the section only applying to persons interested in the enterprise or voyage in which the ship was employed, at the time of such capture.
Ibid. Under the slave trade act of 1794, sec. 1, it is not necessary, in order to incur the forfeiture, that the
vessel shall be completely fitted and ready for sea. As soon as the preparations have proceeded so far as clearly to manifest the intention, the right of seizure attaches. The Emily and Caroline, 9 Wheat. 381 ; 5 Cond. Rep. 623.
The African slave trade is a trade which has been authorized and protected by the laws of all commercial nations. The right to carry it on has been claimed by each, and exercised by each ; and it therefore cannot be considered as contrary to the laws of nations. The slave trade remains lawful to those nations which have not forbidden it. The Antelope, 10 Wheat. 66 ; 6 Cond. Rep. 30.
If the slave trade is not contrary to the laws of nations, it cannot be piracy, unless so declared by statute ; and the obligations of such statute cannot exceed the power of the state which has enacted it. Ibid.

Sec . 2. And be it further enacted, That there shall be established, at each of the aforesaid arsenals, a national armoury, in which shall be employed one superintendent, and one master-armourer (who shall be appointed by the President of the United States) and as many workmen as the Secretary for the department of war shall, from time to time, deem necessary, so that the whole number at all the armouries shall not exceed one hundred. And the said superintendents shall each receive as a compensation, seventy dollars per month, and the said masterarmourers each, fifty dollars per month.
Sec . 3. And be it further enacted, That there shall be employed an officer, whose duty it shall be (under the direction of the department of war) to superintend the receiving, safe keeping and distribution of the military stores of the United States, and to call to account all persons, to whom the same may be intrusted: he shall receive for his compensation, at the rate of one hundred and twenty-five dollars per month, and shall be appointed by the President of the United States.
Sec . 4.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That if any commissioned officer in the troops of the United States shall, while in the service of the United States, die by reason of wounds received in actual service of the United States, and shall leave a widow, or if no widow, shall leave a child or children, under age, such widow, or if no widow, such child or children, shall be entitled to, and receive the half of the monthly pay, to which the deceased was entitled at the time of his death, for and during the term of five years: And in case of the death or intermarriage of such widow, before the expiration of the said term of five years, the half pay, for the remainder of the term, shall go to the child or children of such deceased officer, while under the age of sixteen years, and, in like manner, the allowance to the child or children
of such deceased, where there is no widow, shall be paid no longer than while there is a child or children under the age aforesaid. Provided, That no greater sum shall be allowed in any case, to the widow or to the child or children of any officer, than the half pay of a lieutenant colonel.

June 7, 1794. Chap . LI1I.--An Act for the remission of the duties on certain distilled spirits destroyed by fire.

Remission of certain duties to Jabez Rogers.

Whe re as Jabez Rogers, junior, who had erected large works at Middlebury, in the state of Vermont, for distilling spirits from the produce of the country, has had the same twice destroyed by fire with a quantity of spirits therein, on which, by law, duties had become payable to the United States : And whereas, considering the equity of the case,
said duties ought to be remitted; therefore, Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled, That the duties payable to the United States on all such distilled spirits, as shall be proved, to the satisfaction of the supervisor of the district of Vermont, to have been destroyed by fire in the distilleries lately burnt at Middlebury in the state

against the allegation that this was an original construction or outfit of the vessel for the purposes of war. Moodie v. The Alfred, 3 Dall. 307; 1 Cond. Rep. 135.
A French privateer had taken out her guns, masts, and sails, which remained on shore Until the general repairs were completed, and they were again put on board ; after which she sailed on a cruise, and captured a British vessel, which she sent into Charleston. On a claim of restitution on the ground that the. vessel had been originally fitted out in the United States, in a neutral port, the court decided that the mere replacement of her force could not be considered as an augmentation ; even if an augmentation of force should be considered a cause for restoration. Moodie v. The sloop Phoebe Ann, 3 Dall. 319; 1
Cond. Rep. 139. A neutral nation may, if so disposed, without a breach of her neutrality, grant permission to both
belligerents to equip their vessels of war within her territories. But without such permission, the subjects of such belligerent powers have no right to equip vessels of war, or to augment their force, either with arms or men, within the neutral territory. The Alerta v. Blas Moran, 9 Cranch, 359; 3 Cond. Rep. 425.
Such unauthorized acts violate the sovereignty of a neutral nation. All captures made by such equipments are illegal in respect to such nation, and it is competent for her courts to punish the offenders; and if prizes are brought within their jurisdiction, to order and cause them to be restored. Ibid.
It is immaterial whether the persons taken on board at the neutral port were native American citizens or foreigners domiciled in the United States. Neither the law of nations, nor the act of Congress recognizes any distinction, except to the subjects of the state in whose service they were enlisted transiently in the United States. Ibid.
An augmentation of force, affects only captures made during the original cruise. The offence terminates at the end of the voyage, and does not affect subsequent transactions. But as to captures made during the same cruise, the doctrine has been long established, that such illegal augmentation of force is a violation of the law of nations, as well as of our own municipal laws; and as a violation of our neutrality, it affects the captures subsequently made with the character of torts ; and justifies and requires a restitution of the property to such persons as have been injured by such misconduct. The Santissima Trinidad, 7 Wheat. 283 ; 5 Cond. Rep. 284.
The practice is now fully established, that prizes made by vessels which have violated the acts of Congress enacted for the preservation of the neutrality of the United States, if brought within her territory shall be restored. The Gran Para, 7 Wheat. 471 ; 5 Cond. Rep. 328.
It has never been held that the offence adheres to the vessel under whatever change takes place ; nor that it does not terminate when the voyage, for which the illegal outfit was made, shall have ended. But if this termination was merely colourable, and the vessel was equipped with the intention of being employed on the cruise during which the capture was made, the violation is not purged. Ibid.
Property belonging to a friendly power, captured on the high seas by a privateer, armed and fitted out by citizens of the United States, in the waters of the United States, as a vessel of war, and commanded by a citizen of the United States, is illegally captured; and must be restored to its owner, if brought within our jurisdiction. The Fanny, 9 Wheat. 658 ; 5 Cond. Rep. 722.
A French privateer fitted out in the United States, and commissioned as a privateer by the French minister residing in the United States, being proscribed by the President of the United States, dismantled and sold in Charleston, was afterwards fitted out for war in a foreign port, and was commissioned by France. Captures made by her are not illegal, and are no violation of the neutrality of the United States. Williamson v. The Betsey, Bee's Admiralty Decisions, 67.
The laws of neutrality'and nations do not, in any case, interdict vessels from going to sea armed and fitted for defensive war. Bee's Adm. Decisions, 69.
It is a violation of the act of June 5, 1794, to concert an expedition from the United States to commit hostilities against a power at peace with the United States ; and it is unimportant that such expedition originated beyond seas, if carried on from this country. It is unimportant whether the persons engaged in such a purpose, engage the whole vessel to themselves, or depart as passengers. 1 Peters's C. C. R. 487.
The previous knowledge or approbation of the President of the United States, of the illegal act of a citizen, can afford him no justification of the breach of a constitutional law. Trial of Smith and Ogden,
237. To bring a case within the 5th section of the act of June 5, 1794, made perpetual by the act of April
24, 1800, prohibiting any person within the territory or jurisdiction of the United States from providing or preparing the means of a military expedition or enterprise to be carried on from thence, against the territory or dominions of any foreign prince or state, with whom the United States are at peace, it is immaterial whether or not the vessel, at the identical time of sailing, is in complete readiness for hostile engagement. If the vessel sailed with the means or intent to carry it on, such an enterprise is within
the act. Ibid. Indictment under the 3d section of the act for the punishment of certain crimes against the United
States, passed April 20, 1818. The indictment charged the defendant with being knowingly concerned in fitting out in the port of Baltimore, a vessel with intent to employ her in the service of a "foreign people," " The United Provinces of Buenos Ayres," against the subjects of the emperor of Brazil, with whom the United States were at peace. The vessel went from Baltimore to St. Thomas, and was there fully armed. She afterwards cruised under the Buenos Ayrean flag. Held :--To bring the defendant within the words of the act, it is not necessary to charge him with being concerned in fitting out and arming the vessel. The words are, fitting out or arming; either will constitute the offence. It is sufficient if the indictment charges the offence in the words of the act. The United States v. John B. Quincy, 6
Peters, 445. The law does not prohibit armed vessels, belonging to citizens of the United States, from sailing out
of our ports. It only requires the owner of such vessels to give security, that such vessels shall not be employed by them to commit hostilities against a foreign power at peace with the United States. Ibid.

Sec . 18. And be it further enacted, That the deputy-postmasters

shall, respectively, publish at the expiration of every three months, or

offices, or instead thereof, shall make out a number of such lists, and

cause them to be posted at such public places in their vicinity, as shall

appear to them best adapted for the information of the parties con-

cerned ; and at the expiration of the next three months, shall send such

of the said letters as then remain on hand, as dead letters to the general

post-office, where the same shall be opened and inspected; and if any

valuable papers or matter of consequence shall be found therein, it shall

(a) The decisions of the courts of the United States on the duties and obligations of the " Postmaster General," " Postmasters," and the " Post-office," have been :
When the issue is taken upon the neglect of the postmaster himself, it is not competent to give in evidence the neglect of his assistant. Dunlop v. Munroe, 7 Cranch, 242 ; 2 Cond. Rep. 484.
When it is intended to charge a postmaster for the negligence of his assistants, the pleadings must be made up according to the case; and his liability then will only result from his own neglect in not properly superintending the discharge of their duties in his office. Ibid.
In order to make a postmaster liable for negligence, it must appear that the loss or injury sustained by the plaintiff, was the consequence of his negligence. Ibid.
Parol evidence cannot be given, that one set of written instructions from the postmaster general superseded the other. Ibid.
The circuit courts of the Union have jurisdiction, under the constitution, and the acts of April 30, 1810, sec. 29, and of March 3, 1815, sec. 4, of suits brought in the name of " The Postmaster General of the United States," on bonds given to the postmaster general by a deputy postmaster, conditioned " to pay all monies that shall come to his hands for the postages of whatever is by law chargeable with postage, to the postmaster general of the United States for the time being, deducting only the commission and allowances made by law, for his care, trouble and charges in managing said office," &c. Postmaster General v. Early, 12 Wheat. 136 ; 6 Cond. Rep. 480.
The postmaster general has a right to take a bond from postmasters to him, as postmaster general, under the different acts establishing and regulating the post-office department; and particularly under the act of May 1, 1810, chap. 42, sec. 29. Ibid.
An entry in the post bill, is by no means conclusive evidence of the transmission of a letter so as to charge the postmaster for it; still, it may never have been put into the mail, or it may have been stolen on the passage. Dunlop v. Monroe, 7 Cranch, 242 : 2 Cond. Rep. 484.
The neglect of the postmaster general to sue for balances due by postmasters, within the time pre-

364

THIRD CONGRESS. Sess . I. Ch . 23. 1794.

Postmaster general to prosecute deputies neglecting to settle, and

Sec . 24. And be it further enacted, That if any deputy postmaster, or other person authorized to receive the postage of letters and packets, shall neglect or refuse to render his accounts, and pay over to the Postmaster General, the balance by him due, at the end of every three months,

scribed by law, although he is thereby rendered personally chargeable by the United States with such balances, is not a discharge of such postmasters or their sureties from liability on their official bonds. Nor is an order from the postmaster general to retain those balances, directed to the postmaster, until they should be drawn for by the general post-office. Locke v. The Postmaster General, 3 Mason's C. C. R. 446.
The provisions of law enjoining on the postmaster general to require from his deputies regular periodical settlements and payments, are directory to him, but they form no condition in the contract between the postmasters and their sureties. Ibid.
The postmaster general cannot sue in the federal courts under that part of the constitution which gives jurisdiction to those courts in consequence of the character of the party, nor is he authorized to sue by the judiciary act. He comes into the courts of the United States under the authority of an act of Congress, the constitutionality of which rests upon the admission that his suit is a case arising under a law of the United States. Osborn et al. v. The Bank of United States, 9 Wheat. 738 ; 5 Cond. Rep. 741.
The act of Congress, for regulating the post-office department, does not, in terms, discharge the obligors, in the official bond of a deputy postmaster, from the direct claim of the United States upon them, on the failure of the postmaster general to commence a suit against the defaulting postmaster, within the time prescribed by law. Their liability, therefore, continues. They remain the debtors of the United States. The responsibility of the postmaster general is superadded to, not substituted for, that of the obligors. Dox et al. v. The Postmaster General, 1 Peters, 323.
The claim of the United States, upon the official bond of a postmaster, and upon all the parties thereto, is not released by the laches of the postmaster general, to whom the assertion of this claim is entrusted by law. Such laches have no effect, whatsoever, on the claims of the United States, as well on the sureties, as upon the principal in the bond. Ibid.
The circuit court of the United States for the District of Columbia, has a right to award a mandamus to the postmaster general of the United States, requiring him to pass to the credit of certain contractors for carrying the United States mail, a sum found to be due to them, by the solicitor of the treasury of the United States, the solicitor acting under the provisions of a special act of Congress. The mandamus does not seek to direct or control the postmaster general in the performance of an official duty, partaking in any respect of an executive character; but to enforce the performance of a mere ministerial act, which neither he, nor the President, has any authority to control. Kendall, Postmaster General v. The United States, on the relation of Stockton and Stokes, 12 Peters, 524.
The distinction between the relation of a postmaster to his sworn assistant acting under him, and between master and servant generally, has long been settled ; and though the latter relation might sanction the admission of evidence in an action against the postmaster, to show the neglect of the assistant, if it is intended to charge the postmaster with the neglect of the assistant, the pleading must be made up according to the case ; and his liability will then only result from his neglect in not propeily superintending the discharge of their duties in his office. Dunlop v. Monroe, 7 Cranch, 242; 2 Cond. Rep. 484.
Where there are items of debit and credit, in a running account between the postmaster general and the deputy postmasters, in the absence of any specific appropriation by either party, the credits are to be applied to the discharge of the debits antecedently due, in the order of the account. Postmaster General v. Furber, 4 Mason's C. C. R. 333.
The official bonds taken by the postmaster general from his deputies are valid ; and the omission to bring suits on such bonds, for the defaults of the principal in such a bond, does not discharge the sureties. Postmaster General v. Reeder, 4 Wash. C. C. R. 678.
The mere omission to bring suit on such official bonds, by the postmaster general, against a deputy postmaster, is not, per se, evidence of fraud. Ibid.
The giving a new official bond by a deputy postmaster, does not discharge his sureties under the old bond, for the past or subsequent defaults of the postmaster. Ibid.
The order of the postmaster general, to the deputy postmaster, not to remit the money he may receive, but to retain it to answer his drafts, does not discharge the sureties. Ibid.
The equity rule of limitations applied to bonds where there has been no demand for twenty years, is a mere presumption of payment, not an absolute limitation. Postmaster General v. Rice, Gilpin's D. C.
R. 562` The provisions of the act of March 3, 1825, releasing the sureties of a deputy postmaster where suit
is not brought within two years after a default, do not apply to a default which occurred before the passing of the act. Ibid.
The law which limits suits by the postmaster general against sureties, to two years after a default of the principal, does not operate in cases of balances unpaid at the end of a quarter, which are subsequently liquidated by the receipts of a succeeding one. Postmaster General v. Norvel, Gilpin's D. C. R.
131. A bond given by a postmaster, with sureties, for the performance of official duties, does not constitute
a binding contract, until approved and accepted by the postmaster general. Ibid. The reception and detention of an official bond, by the postmaster general for a considerable time,
without objection, is sufficient proof of its acceptance. Ibid. The return of a bond to the principal obligor, by the postmaster general, for the purpose of obtaining
additional security, affords no proof that it was not accepted; nor does it amount either to a surrender or cancelling of it. Ibid.
The postmaster general has a right to require a bond from a deputy postmaster, for the faithful performance of his duties, although such bond is not expressly required by law. Postmaster General v. Rice,
Gilpin's D, C. R. 554.

it shall be the duty of the Postmaster General to cause a suit to be commenced against the person or persons so neglecting or refusing: and if the Postmaster General shah not cause such suit to be commenced within six months from the end of every such three months, the balances due from every such delinquent, shall be charged to, and recoverable from, the Postmaster General.
Sec . 25. And be it further enacted, That all pecuniary penalties and
forfeitures incurred under this act, shall be, one half for the use of the person or persons informing and prosecuting for the same, and the other half to the use of the United States.
Sec . 26. And be it further enacted, That it shall be lawful for the Postmaster General, to make provision, where it may be necessary, for the receipt of all letters and packets intended to be conveyed by any ship or vessel, beyond sea, or from any port of the United States to another port therein; and the letters so received shall be formed into a mail, sealed up, and directed to the postmaster of the port, to which

The provisions of the act of March 3, 1825, substitute a certified statement of the settled account as evidence in suits against deputy postmasters, in lieu of the certified account current required by the act of April 30, 1810. Ibid.
A mail carrier is within the 18th section of the " act regulating the post-office establishment," subjecting to a penalty in certain cases, persons employed in any departments of the general post-office. United States v. Belew, 2 Brockenb. C. C. R. 280.
The United States instituted a suit against the Bank of the Metropolis, claiming twenty-seven thousand eight hundred and eighty-one dollars and fifty-seven cents, the balance, according to the statements of the Treasury, due to the United States. The defendant claimed credits amounting to twenty-three thousand dollars, exclusive of interest, which had been presented to the proper accounting officers, for acceptances of the post-office department of the drafts of mail contractors, and an item of six hundred and eleven dollars and fifty-two cents, overdraft of an officer of the post-office department, on the Bank of the Metropolis. The drafts of the contractors, accepted by the post-office department, were discounted by the Bank, in the way of business; one draft was accepted unconditionally, the other drafts were accepted, " on condition, that the contracts be complied with." Held : That the Bank became the holder of the draft unconditionally accepted, for valuable consideration ; and its light to charge the United States with the amount cannot be defeated by any equities between the drawers, and the postoffice. The United States v. The Bank of the Metropolis, 15 Peters, 377.
It was no matter, how the account of the drawer of the draft unconditionally accepted stood with the post-office department; whether he was a debtor or a creditor; whether the Bank knew one or the other. An unconditional acceptance was tendered to the Bank for discount. It was not the duty of the Bank to inquire how the account stood, or for what purpose the acceptance was made. All it had to look to was the genuineness of the acceptance, and the authority of the officer to give it. Ibid.
The rule is, that the want of consideration between the drawer and the acceptor is no defence against the rights of a third party, who has given a consideration for the bill: and this, even though the acceptor has been defrauded by the drawee, if that be not known to such third party. Ibid.
If one purpose making a conditional acceptance only, and commit that acceptance to writing, he should be careful to express the condition therein. He cannot use general terms, and then exempt himself from liability, by relying upon particular facts which have already happened, though they are connected with the conditional acceptance. By express terms the acceptor might have guarded against any construction, other than that which was intended by, or was the apparent meaning of the words of the acceptance. It matters not what the acceptor meant by a cautious and precise phraseology, if it be not expressed as a condition. Ibid.
Nothing out of the condition expressed in the words of the acceptance can be inferred; unless it be in a case where the words used are so ambiguous as to make it necessary that parol evidence should be resorted to, to explain them. Ibid.
If two persons deal in relation to the executory contracts of a third, and one of them, being the obligee, induces the other to advance money, " upon condition that his contracts be complied with," and he knows that forfeitures have been already incurred by the obligor, for breaches of his contract, and does not say so, he shall not be permitted afterwards to get rid of his liability, by saying, " I cannot pay you, for when I accepted there was already due to me from the drawer of the bills more than I accepted for; you did not choose to make inquiry." Ibid.
The terms " accepted, when the contracts of the drawer of the bill are complied with," are not retroactive; they do not refer to past transactions, to the subsequent performance of the contractors. Ibid.
The postmaster general had the same power, and no more, over the credits allowed by his predecessor, if allowed within the scope of his official authority, as given by law to the head of the department. This right in an incumbent of reviewing a predecessor's decisions, extends to mistakes in matters of fact, arising from errors in calculation, and to cases of rejected claims in which material testimony is afterwards discovered and produced. But, if a credit has been given, or an allowance made by the head of a department, and it is alleged to be an illegal allowance, the judicial tribunals must be resorted to, to construe the law under which the allowance was made; and to settle the right between the United States and the party to whom the credit was given. It is no longer a case between one officer's judgment, and that of his successor. No statute is necessary to authorize the United States to sue in such a case. The right to sue is independent of statute, and it may be done by the direction of the incumbent of the department. The United States v. The Bank of the Metropolis, 15 Peters, 377.

isfaction of the supervisor, within whose district he shall be, that an auctioneer hath acted agreeably to the condition of the bond which he shall have given, and to the directions of this act, during the time, to which his said bond shall relate, the same having expired; then, and in every such case, the said supervisor shall cause such bond to be delivered up; but in case no such account shall be delivered, as herein before mentioned, or if it shall appear, that any such account was not truly made, or that the party hath acted in any other respect, contrary to the true intent and meaning of his bond and of this act, it shall be the duty of such supervisor of the revenue, to cause such bond to be prosecuted according to law, and in case of a verdict or judgment against the defendant, he shall afterwards, upon every sale by him of any estates, goods or effects at auction, be liable to all the penalties, which may be incurred by this act, for acting as an auctioneer without license.
Sec . 8. And be it further enacted, That if any sale at auction of any lands, tenements or hereditaments, shall be, or become void, by reason of defect of title, the supervisor of the revenue, within whose district such sale shall be, is hereby authorized and required, upon due and sufficient proof of such sale being or becoming void, for the reason aforesaid, to cause to be remitted the duty or duties thereupon other-
wise payable according to this act. Sec . 9. And be it further enacted, That every auctioneer, out of the

A TREATY
Between the United States of America, and the Tribes of Indians called the Six Nations.
The President of the United States having determined to hold a conference with the Six Nations of Indians, for the purpose of removing from their minds all causes of complaint, and establishing a firm and permanent friendship with them; and Timothy Pickering being appointed sole agent for that purpose; and the agent having met and conferred with the Sachems, Chiefs and Warriors of the Six Nations, in a general council: Now, in order to accomplish the good design of this conference, the parties have agreed on the following articles; which, when ratified by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate of the United States, shall be binding on them and the Six Nations.
ARTICLE I. Peace and friendship are herely firmly established, and shall be perpetual, between the United States and the Six Nations.

TREATY WITH THE SIX NATIONS. 1794.

45

ARTICLE II.
The United States acknowledge the lands reserved to the Oneida, Onondaga and Cayuga Nations, in their respective treaties with the state of New-York, and called their reservations, to be their property; and the United States will never claim the same, nor disturb them or either of the Six Nations, nor their Indian friends residing thereon and united with them, in the free use and enjoyment thereof: but the said reservations shall remain theirs, until they choose to sell the same to the people of the United States, who have the right to purchase.

Certain lands secured to Indians.

ARTICLE III.
The land of the Seneka nation is bounded as follows: Beginning on Lake Ontario, at the north-west corner of the land they sold to Oliver Phelps, the line runs westerly along the lake, as far as O-yong-wong-yeh Creek, at Johnson's Landing-place, about four miles eastward from the fort of Niagara; then southerly up that creek to its main fork, then straight to the main fork of Stedman's creek, which empties into the river Niagara, above fort Schlosser, and then onward, from that fork, continuing the same straight course, to that river; (this line, from the mouth of O-yong-wong-yeh Creek to the river Niagara, above fort Schlosser, being the eastern boundary of a strip of land, extending from the same line to Niagara river, which the Seneka nation ceded to the King of Great-Britain, at a treaty held about thirty years ago, with Sir William Johnson;) then the line runs along the river Niagara to Lake Erie; then along Lake Erie to the north-east corner of a triangular piece of land which the United States conveyed to the state of Pennsylvania, as by the President's patent, dated the third day of March, 1792; then due south to the northern boundary of that state; then due east to the south-west corner of the land sold by the Seneka nation to Oliver Phelps; and then north and northerly, along Phelps's line, to the place of beginning on Lake Ontario. Now, the United States acknowledge all the land within the aforementioned boundaries, to be the property of the Seneka nation; and the United States will never claim the same, nor disturb the Seneka nation, nor any of the Six Nations, or of their Indian friends residing thereon and united with them, in the free use and enjoyment thereof: but it shall remain theirs, until they choose to sell the same to the people of the United States, who have the right to purchase.
ARTICLE IV.

Boundary of lands belonging to the Seneka nation.

The United States having thus described and acknowledged what lands belong to the Oneidas, Onondagas, Cayugas and Senekas, and engaged never to claim the same, nor to disturb them, or any of the Six Nations, or their Indian friends residing thereon and united with them, in the free use and enjoyment thereof: Now, the Six Nations, and each of them, hereby engage that they will never claim any other lands within the boundaries of the United States; nor ever disturb the people of the United States in the free use and enjoyment thereof.

Six Nations never to claim other lands in the U. S.

ARTICLE V.
The Seneka nation, all others of the Six Nations concurring, cede to the United States the right of making a waggon road from Fort Schlosser to Lake Erie, as far south as Buffaloe Creek; and the people of the United States shall have the free and undisturbed use of this road, for the purposes of travelling and transportation. And the Six Nations, and each of them, will forever allow to the people of the United States, a free passage through their lands, and the free use of the harbours and rivers adjoining and within their respective tracts of land,

Right to make and use a road granted.

46
Present and annuity.

TREATY WITH THE SIX NATIONS. 1794.

for the passing and securing of vessels and boats, and liberty to land their cargoes where necessary for their safety.
ARTICLE VI.
In consideration of the peace and friendship hereby established, and of the engagements entered into by the Six Nations; and because the United States desire, with humanity and kindness, to contribute to their comfortable support; and to render the peace and friendship hereby established, strong and perpetual; the United States now deliver to the Six Nations, and the Indians of the other nations residing among and united with them, a quantity of goods of the value of ten thousand dollars. And for the same considerations, and with a view to promote the future welfare of the Six Nations, and of their Indian friends aforesaid, the United States will add the sum of three thousand dollars to the one thousand five hundred dollars, heretofore allowed them by an article ratified by the President, on the twenty-third day of April, 1792; making in the whole, four thousand five hundred dollars; which shall be expended yearly forever, in purchasing cloathing, domestic animals, implements of husbandry, and other utensils suited to their circumstances, and in compensating useful artificers, who shall reside with or near them, and be employed for their benefit. The immediate application of the whole annual allowance now stipulated, to be made by the superintendant appointed by the President for the affairs of the Six Nations, and their Indian friends aforesaid.
ARTICLE VIL
Lest the firm peace and friendship now established should be interrupted by the misconduct of individuals, the United States and Six Nations agree, that for injuries done by individuals on either side, no private revenge or retaliation shall take place; but, instead thereof, complaint shall be made by the party injured, to the other: By the Six Nations or any of them, to the President of the United States, or the Superintendant by him appointed: and by the Superintendant, or other person appointed by the President, to the principal chiefs of the Six Nations, or of the nation to which the offender belongs: and such prudent measures shall then be pursued as shall be necessary to preserve our peace and friendship unbroken; until the legislature (or great council) of the United States shall make other equitable provision for the purpose.
Not e . It is clearly understood by the parties to this treaty, that the annuity stipulated in the sixth article, is to be applied to the benefit of such of the Six Nations and of their Indian friends united with them as aforesaid, as do or shall reside within the boundaries of the United States: For the United States do not interfere with nations, tribes or families, of Indians elsewhere resident.

In Witn ess whereof, the said Timothy Pickering, and the Sachems and War-chiefs of the said Six Nations, have hereto set their hands and seals.

Done at Kon-on-daigua, in the state of New York, the eleventh day of November, in the Year one thousand seven hundred and ninetyfour.

TREATY OF AMITY, COMMERCE AND NAVIGATION,

Between His Britannic Majesty and the United States of America, by their President, with the Advice and Consent of their Senate. (a)

Nov. 19, 1794.

His Britannic Majesty and the United States of America, being desirous, by a treaty of amity, commerce and navigation, to terminate their differences in such a manner, as, without reference to the merits of their respective complaints and pretensions, may be the best calculated to produce mutual satisfaction and good understanding; and also to regulate the commerce and navigation between their respective countries, territories and people, in such a manner as to render the same reciprocally beneficial and satisfactory; they have, respectively, named their plenipotentiaries, and given them full powers to treat of, and conclude the said treaty; that is to say : His Britannic Majesty has named for his Plenipotentiary, the Right Honorable William Wyndham Baron Grenville of Wotton, one of his Majesty's Privy Council, and his Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs; and the President of the said United States, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate thereof, hath appointed for their plenipotentiary, the honorable

Additional note of the decisions of the courts of the United States, in cases arising under the Definitive Treaty of Peace with Great Britain of September 4, 1783.
The treaty of peace between the United States and Great Britain, prevents the operation of the act of limitations of Virginia, upon British debts contracted before that treaty. Hopkirk v. Bell, 3 Branch, 454; 1 Cond. Rep. 595.
The treaty of peace of 1783, between the United States and Great Britain, was a mere recognition of pre-existing rights as to territory, and no territory was thereby acquired by way of cession from Great Britain. Harcourt et al. v. Gaillard, 12 Wheat. 523 ; 6 Cond. Rep. 628.
The act of the legislature of Virginia, of 1799, entitled "An act concerning escheats and forfeitures from British subjects," and under which a debtor to a subject of Great Britain had, in conformity to the provisions of that law, during the war, paid into the loan office of the state a portion of the debt due by him, did not operate to protect the debtor from a suit for such debt, after the treaty of peace in 1783. The statute of Virginia, if it was valid, and the legislature could pass such a law, was annulled by the fourth article of the treaty ; and under this article, suits for the recovery of debts so due, might be maintained, the provisions of the Virginia law to the contrary notwithstanding. Ware, Adm'r of Jones, Plaintiff in Error v. Hylton et al. 3 Dall. 199 ; 1 Cond. Rep. 99.
Debts due in the United States to British subjects, before the war of the revolution, though sequestered or paid into the state treasuries, revived by the treaty of peace of 1783, and the creditors are entitled to recover them from the original debtors. State of Georgia v. Brailsford, 3 Dall. 1; 1 Cond. Rep. 8.
G. C., born in the colony of New York, went to England in 1738, where he resided until his decease; and being seised of lands in New York, he, on the 30th of November, 1776, in England, devised the same to the defendant and E. C., as tenants in common, and died so seised on the 10th of December, 1776. The defendant and E. C. having entered, and becoming possessed, E. C., on the 3d December, 1791, bargained and sold to the defendant all his interest. The defendant and E. C. were both born in England, long before the revolution. On the 22d March, 1791, the legislature of New York passed*an act to enable the defendant to purchase lands, and to hold all other lands which be might then be entitled to within the state, by purchase or descent, in fee simple ; and to sell and dispose of the same, in the same manner as any natural born citizen might do. The treaty between the United States and Great Britain of 1794, contains the following provision: " Article 9th. It is agreed that British subjects who now hold lands in the territories of the United States, and American citizens who now hold lands in the dominions of his majesty, shall continue to hold them according to the nature and tenure of their respective estates and titles therein; and may grant, sell, or devise the same to whom they please, in like manner as if they were natives; and that neither they nor their heirs or assigns shall, so far as respects the said lands and the legal remedies incident thereto, be considered as aliens." The defendant, at the time of the action brought, still continued to be a British subject. Held, that he was entitled to hold the lands so devised to him by G. C., and transferred to him by E. C.

John Jay, Chief Justice of the said United States, and their envoy extraordinary to his Majesty: who have agreed on and concluded the following articles.
ARTICLE I.
There shall be a firm, inviolable and universal peace, and a true and sincere friendship between his Britannic Majesty, his heirs and successors, and the United States of America; and between their respective countries, territories, cities, towns and people of every degree, without exception of persons or places.

Peace established.

ARTICLE II.
His Majesty will withdraw all his troops and garrisons from all posts and places within the boundary lines assigned by the treaty of peace to the United States. This evacuation shall take place on or before the first day of June, one thousand seven hundred and ninety-six, and all the proper measures shall in the interval be taken by concert between the government of the United States, and his Majesty's Governor-General in America, for settling the previous arrangements which may be necessary respecting the delivery of the said posts: The United States in the mean time at their discretion, extending their settlements to any part within the said boundary line, except within the precincts or jurisdiction of any of the said posts. All settlers and traders, within the precincts or jurisdiction of the said posts, shall continue to enjoy, unmolested, all their property of every kind, and shall be protected therein. They shall be at full liberty to remain there, or to remove with all or any part of their effects; and it shall also be free to them to sell their lands, houses, or effects, or to retain the property thereof, at their dis-
cretion; such of them as shall continue to reside within the said boundary lines, shall not be compelled to become citizens of the United States, or to take any oath of allegiance to the government thereof; but they shall be at full liberty so to do if they think proper, and they shall make and declare their election within one year after the evacuation aforesaid. And all persons who shall continue there after the expiration of the said year, without having declared their intention of remaining subjects of his Britannic Majesty, shall be considered as having elected to become citizens of the United States.

His Majesty to withdraw troops from U. States. Privileges allowed to settlers and traders.

ARTICLE III.
It is agreed that it shall at all times be free to his Majesty's subjects, and to the citizens of the United States, and also to the Indians dwelling on either side of the said boundary line, freely to pass and repass by land or inland navigation, into the respective territories and countries of the two parties, on the continent of America (the country within the limits of the Hudson's bay Company only excepted) and to navigate all the lakes, rivers and waters thereof, and freely to carry on trade and commerce with each other. But it is understood, that this article does not extend to the admission of vessels of the United States into the sea-ports, harbours, bays, or creeks of his Majesty's said territories; nor into such parts of the rivers in his Majesty's said territories as are between the mouth thereof, and the highest port of entry from the sea, except in small vessels trading bona fide between Montreal and Quebec, under such regulations as shall be established to prevent the possibility of any frauds in this respect. Nor to the admission of British vessels from the sea into the rivers of the United States, beyond the highest ports of entry for foreign vessels from the sea. The river Missisippi shall, however, according to the treaty of peace, be entirely open to both parties; and it is further agreed, that all the ports and places on its eastern side, to whichsoever of the parties belonging, may freely be

Commercial intercourse regulated between the two parties on the continent of America.

TREATY WITH GREAT BRITAIN. 1794.
resorted to and used by both parties, in as ample a manner as any of the Atlantic ports or places of the United States, or any of the ports or places of his Majesty in Great-Britain.
All goods and merchandize whose importation into his Majesty's said territories in America, shall not be entirely prohibited, may freely, for the purposes of commerce, be carried into the same in the manner aforesaid, by the citizens of the United States, and such goods and merchandize shall be subject to no higher or other duties, than would be payable by his Majesty's subjects on the importation of the same from Europe into the said territories. And in like manner, all goods and merchandize whose importation into the United States shall not be wholly prohibited, may freely, for the purposes of commerce, be carried into the same, in the manner aforesaid, by his Majesty's subjects, and such goods and merchandize shall be subject to no higher or other duties, than would be payable by the citizens of the United States on the importation of the same in American vessels into the Atlantic ports of the said states. And all goods not prohibited to be exported from the said territories respectively, may in like manner be carried out of the same by the two parties respectively, paying duty as aforesaid.
No duty of entry shall ever be levied by either party on peltries brought by land, or inland navigation into the said territories respectively, nor shall the Indians passing or repassing with their own proper goods and effects of whatever nature, pay for the same any impost or duty whatever. But goods in bales, or other large packages, unusual among Indians, shall not be considered as goods belonging bona fide to Indians.
No higher or other tolls or rates of ferriage than what are or shall be payable by natives, shall be demanded on either side; and no duties shall be payable on any goods which shall merely be carried over any of the portages or carrying-places on either side, for the purpose of being immediately re-imbarked and carried to some other place or places. But as by this stipulation it is only meant to secure to each party a free passage across the portages on both sides: it is agreed, that this exemption from duty shall extend only to such goods as are carried in the usual and direct road across the portage, and are not attempted to be in any manner sold or exchanged during their passage across the same, and proper regulations may be established to prevent the possibility of any frauds in this respect.
As this article is intended to render in a great degree the local advantages of each party common to both, and thereby to promote a disposition favorable to friendship and good neighbourhood, it is agreed, that the respective governments will mutually promote this amicable intercourse, by causing speedy and impartial justice to be done, and necessary protection to be extended to all who may be concerned therein.
ARTICLE IV.
Whereas it is uncertain whether the river Missisippi extends so far to the northward, as to be intersected by a line to be drawn due west from the Lake of the Woods, in the manner mentioned in the treaty of peace between his Majesty and the United States: it is agreed, that measures shall be taken in concert between his Majesty's government in America and the government of the United States, for making a joint survey of the said river from one degree of latitude below the falls of St. Anthony, to the principal source or sources of the said river, and also of the parts adjacent thereto; and that if on the result of such survey, it should appear that the said river, would not be intersected by such a line as is above mentioned, the two parties will thereupon proceed by amicable negociation, to regulate the boundary line in that

TREATY WITH GREAT BRITAIN. 1794.

119

quarter, as well as all other points to be adjusted between the said parties, according to justice and mutual convenience, and in conformity to the intent of the said treaty.

ARTICLE V.
Whereas doubts have arisen what river was truly intended under the name of the river St. Croix, mentioned in the said treaty of peace, and forming a part of the boundary therein described; that question shall
be referred to the final decision of commissioners to be appointed in the following manner, viz.
One commissioner shall be named by his Majesty, and one by the President of the United States, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate thereof, and the said two commissioners shall agree on the choice of a third; or if they cannot so agree, they shall each propose one person, and of the two names so proposed, one shall be drawn by lot in the presence of the two original commissioners. And the three
commissioners so appointed, shall be sworn, impartially to examine and
decide the said question, according to such evidence as shall respectively be laid before them on the part of the British government and of the United States. The said commissioners shall meet at Halifax, and shall have power to adjourn to such other place or places as they shall think fit. They shall have power to appoint a secretary, and to employ such surveyors or other persons as they shall judge necessary. The
said commissioners shall, by a declaration, under their hands and seals,
decide what river is the river St. Croix, intended by the treaty. The said declaration shall contain a description of the said river, and shall particularize the latitude and longitude of its mouth and of its source. Duplicates of this declaration and of the statements of their accounts, and of the journal of their proceedings, shall be delivered by them to the agent of his Majesty, and to the agent of the United States, who may be respectively appointed and authorized to manage the business on behalf of the respective governments. And both parties agree to
consider such decision as final and conclusive, so as that the same shall
never thereafter be called into question, or made the subject of dispute or difference between them.

Commissioners to be appointed to decide what river is the river St. Croix intended by the treaty of peace to be the boundary of the U. S.

ARTICLE VI.
Whereas it is alledged by divers British merchants and others his Majesty's subjects, that debts, to a considerable amount, which were bona fide contracted before the peace, still remain owing to them by citizens or inhabitants of the United States, and that by the operation
of various lawful impediments since the peace, not only the full recovery
of the said debts has been delayed, but also the value and security thereof have been, in several instances, impaired and lessened, so that by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings, the British creditors cannot now obtain, and actually have and receive full and adequate compensation for the losses and damages which they have thereby sustained. It is agreed, that in all such cases, where full compensation for such losses and damages cannot, for whatever reason, be actually obtained, had and received by the said creditors in the ordinary course of justice, the United States will make full and complete compensation for the same to the said creditors: But it is distinctly understood, that this provision is to extend to such losses only as have been occasioned by the lawful impediments aforesaid, and is not to extend to losses occasioned by such insolvency of the debtors, or other causes as would equally have operated to produce such loss, if the said impediments had not existed; nor to such losses or damages as have been occasioned by the manifest delay or negligence, or wilful omission of the claimant.
For the purpose of ascertaining the amount of any such losses and

damages, five commissioners shall be appointed, and authorized to meet
and act in manner following, viz. Two of them shall be appointed by his Majesty, two of them by the President of the United States by and with the advice and consent of the Senate thereof, and the fifth by the unanimous voice of the other four ; and if they should not agree in such choice, then the commissioners named by the two parties shall respectively propose one person, and of the two names so proposed, one shall
be drawn by lot, in the presence of the four original commissioners. When the five commissioners thus appointed shall first meet, they shall,
before they proceed to act, respectively take the following oath, or affirmation, in the presence of each other; which oath, or affirmation,
being so taken and duly attested, shall be entered on the record of their proceedings, viz. I, A. B. one of the commissioners appointed in pur-
suance of the sixth article of the treaty of amity, commerce, and navigation, between his Britannic Majesty and the United States of America, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will honestly, diligently, impartially, and carefully examine, and to the best of my judgment, according to
justice and equity, decide all such complaints, as under the said article shall be preferred to the said commissioners: and that I will forbear to act as a commissioner, in any case in which I may be personally inter-
ested. Three of the said commissioners shall constitute a board, and shall
have power to do any act appertaining to the said commission, provided that one of the commissioners named on each side, and the fifth com-
missioner shall be present, and all decisions shall be made by the
majority of the voices of the commissioners then present. Eighteen months from the day on which the said commissioners shall form a board, and be ready to proceed to business, are assigned for receiving complaintsand applications; but they are nevertheless authorized, in
any particular cases in which it shall appear to them to be reasonable and just, to extend the said term of eighteen months, for any term not exceeding six months, after the expiration thereof. The said commissioners shall first meet at Philadelphia, but they shall have power to
adjourn from place to place as they shall see cause. The said commissioners in examining the complaints and applica-
tions so preferred to them, are empowered and required, in pursuance of the true intent and meaning of this article, to take into their consideration all claims, whether of principal or interest, or balances of
principal and interest, and to determine the same respectively, according to the merits of the several cases, due regard being had to all the circumstances thereof, and as equity and justice shall appear to them to require. And the said commissioners shall have power to examine all such persons as shall come before them, on oath or affirmation, touching the premises; and also to receive in evidence, according as they may think most consistent with equity and justice, all written deposi-
tions, or books, or papers, or copies, or extracts thereof; every such deposition, book, or paper, or copy, or extract, being duly authenticated, either according to the legal forms now respectively existing in the two
countries, or in such other manner as the said commissioners shall see
cause to require or allow. The award of the said commissioners, or of any three of them as
aforesaid, shall in all cases be final and conclusive, both as to the justice of the claim, and to the amount of the sum to be paid to the creditor or claimant: And the United States undertake to cause the sum so awarded to be paid in specie to such creditor or claimant without deduction ; and at such time or times, and at such place or places, as shall be awarded by the said commissioners; and on condition of such
releases or assignments to be given by the creditor or claimant, as by
the said commissioners may be directed : Provided always, that no such

TREATY WITH GREAT BRITAIN. 1794.

121

payment shall be fixed by the said commissioners to take place sooner than twelve months from the day of the exchange of the ratifications of this treaty.

ARTICLE VII.

Whereas complaints have been made by divers merchants and others,

citizens of the United States, that during the course of the war in

which his Majesty is now engaged, they have sustained considerable

losses and damage, by reason of irregular or illegal captures or condemnations of their vessels and other property, under colour of authority or

commissions from his Majesty, and that from various circumstances be-

longing to the said cases, adequate compensation for the losses and dam-

ages so sustained cannot now be actually obtained, had and received by

the ordinary course of judicial proceedings; it is agreed, that in all such

cases, where adequate compensation cannot, for whatever reason, be now

actually obtained, had and received by the said merchants and others,

in the ordinary course of justice, full and complete compensation for the

same will be made by the British government to the said complainants.

But it is distinctly understood, that this provision is not to extend to

such losses or damages as have been occasioned by the manifest delay

or negligence, or wilful omission of the claimant.

That for the purpose of ascertaining the amount of any such losses

and damages, five commissioners shall be appointed and authorized to

act in London, exactly in the manner directed with respect to those

mentioned in the preceding article, and after having taken the same oath

or affirmation (mutatis mutandis) the same term of eighteen months is

also assigned for the reception of claims, and they are in like manner

authorized to extend the same in particular cases. They shall receive

testimony, books, papers and evidence in the same latitude, and exer-

cise the like discretion and powers respecting that subject; and shall

decide the claims in question according to the merits of the several

cases, and to justice, equity, and the laws of nations. The award of

the said commissioners, or any such three of them as aforesaid, shall in

all cases be final and conclusive, both as to the justice of the claim, and

the amount of the sum to be paid to the claimant; and his Britannic

Majesty undertakes to cause the same to be paid to such claimant in specie, without any deduction, at such place or places, and at such time

or times, as shall be awarded by the said commissioners, and on condi-

tion of such releases or assignments to be given by the claimant, as by the said commissioners may be directed.

And whereas certain merchants and others his Majesty's subjects,

complain, that in the course of the war they have sustained loss and

damage, by reason of the capture of their vessels and merchandize,

taken within the limits and jurisdiction of the states, and brought into

the ports of the same, or taken by vessels originally armed in ports of the said states.

It is agreed that in all such cases where restitution shall not have

been made agreeably to the tenor of the letter from Mr. Jefferson to

Mr. Hammond, dated at Philadelphia, Sept. 5, 1793, a copy of which

is annexed to this treaty; the complaints of the parties shall be and

hereby are referred to the commissioners to be appointed by virtue of

this article, who are hereby authorized and required to proceed in the

like manner relative to these as to the other cases committed to them ;

and the United States undertake to pay to the complainants or claim-

ants in specie, without deduction, the amount of such sums as shall be

awarded to them respectively by the said commissioners, and at the

times and places which in such awards shall be specified; and on con-

dition of such releases or assignments to be given by the claimants as

in the said awards may be directed : And it is further agreed, that not

TREATY WITH GREAT BRITAIN. 1794.

How expenses shall be paid, and vacancy of commissioners supplied.

only the now-existing cases of both descriptions, but also all such as shall exist at the time of exchanging the ratifications of this treaty, shall be considered as being within the provisions, intent, and meaning of this article.
ARTICLE VIII.
It is further agreed, that the commissioners mentioned in this and in the two preceding articles shall be respectively paid in such manner as shall be agreed between the two parties, such agreement being to be settled at the time of the exchange of the ratifications of this treaty. And all other expences attending the said commissions shall be defrayed jointly by the two parties, the same being previously ascertained and allowed by the majority of the commissioners. And in the case of death, sickness or necessary absence, the place of every such commissioner respectively shall be supplied in the same manner as such commissioner was first appointed, and the new commissioners shall take the same oath or affirmation and do the same duties.

Alienage not to affect certain titles to lands.

ARTICLE IX.
It is agreed that British subjects who now hold lands in the territories of the United States, and American citizens who now hold lands in the dominions of his Majesty, shall continue to hold them according to the nature and tenure of their respective estates and titles therein; and may grant, sell, or devise the same to whom they please, in like manner as if they were natives; and that neither they nor their heirs or assigns shall, so far as may respect the said lands and the legal remedies incident thereto, be regarded as aliens.

Sequestration of debts restrained.

ARTICLE X.
Neither the debts due from individuals of the one nation to individuals of the other, nor shares, nor monies which they may have in the public funds, or in the public or private banks, shall ever in any event of war or national differences be sequestered or confiscated, it being unjust and. impolitic that debts and engagements contracted and made by individuals, having confidence in each other and in their respective governments, should ever be destroyed or impaired by national authority on account of national differences and discontents.

ARTICLE XI. It is agreed between his Majesty and the United States of America, that there shall be a reciprocal and entirely perfect liberty of navigation and commerce between their respective people, in the manner, under the limitations and on the conditions specified in the following articles:

West-India trade regulated. Suspended, see page 130.

ARTICLE XII. His Majesty consents that it shall and may be lawful during the time herein-after limited, for the citizens of the United States to carry to any of his Majesty's islands and ports in the West-Indies from the United States, in their own vessels, not being above the burthen of seventy tons, any goods or merchandizes, being of the growth, manufacture or produce of the said states, which it is or may be lawful to carry to the said islands or ports from the said states in British vessels; and that the said American vessels shall be subject there to no other or higher tonnage-duties or charges, than shall be payable by British vessels in the ports of the United States; and that the cargoes of the said American vessels shall be subject there to no other or higher duties or charges, than shall be payable on the like articles if imported there from the said states in British vessels.

TREATY WITH GREAT BRITAIN. 1794.

123

And his Majesty also consents, that it shall be lawful for the said American citizens to purchase, load, and carry away in their said vessels to the United States from the said islands and ports, all such articles, being of the growth, manufacture or produce of the said islands, as may now by law be carried from thence to the said states in British vessels, and subject only to the same duties and charges on exportation, to which British vessels and their cargoes are or shall be subject in similar
circumstances. Provided always, that the said American vessels do carry and land
their cargoes in the United States only, it being expressly agreed and declared, that during the continuance of this article, the United States will prohibit and restrain the carrying any molasses, sugar, coffee, cocoa or cotton in American vessels, either from his Majesty's islands, or from the United States to any part of the world except the United States, reasonable sea-stores excepted. Provided also, that it shall and may be lawful, during the same period, for British vessels to import from the said islands into the United States, and to export from the United States to the said islands, all articles whatever, being of the growth, produce or manufacture of the said islands, or of the United States respectively, which now may, by the laws of the said states, be so imported and exported. And that the cargoes of the said British vessels shall be subject to no other or higher duties or charges, than shall be payable on the same articles if so imported or exported in American vessels.
It is agreed that this article and every matter and thing therein contained, shall continue to be in force during the continuance of the war in which his Majesty is now engaged; and also for two years from and after the day of the signature of the preliminary or other articles of peace, by which the same may be terminated.
And it is further agreed, that at the expiration of the said term, the two contracting parties will endeavour further to regulate their commerce in this respect, according to the situation in which his Majesty may then find himself with respect to the West-Indies, and with a view to such arrangements as may best conduce to the mutual advantage and extension of commerce. And the said parties will then also renew their discussions, and endeavour to agree, whether in any and what cases, neutral vessels shall protect enemy's property; and in what cases provisions and other articles, not generally contraband, may become such. But in the mean time, their conduct towards each other in these respects, shall be regulated by the articles herein-after inserted on those subjects.
ARTICLE XIII.
His Majesty consents that the vessels belonging to the citizens of the United States of America, shall be admitted and hospitably received, in all the sea-ports and harbours of the British territories in the EastIndies. And that the citizens of the said United States, may freely carry on a trade between the said territories and the said United States, in all articles of which the importation or exportation respectively, to or from the said territories, shall not be entirely prohibited. Provided only, that it shall not be lawful for them in any time of war between the British government and any other power or state whatever, to export from the said territories, without the special permission of the British government there, any military stores, or naval stores, or rice. The citizens of the United States shall pay for their vessels when admitted into the said ports no other or higher tonnage-duty than shall be payable on British vessels when admitted into the ports of the United States. And they shall pay no other or higher duties or charges, on the importation or exportation of the cargoes of the said vessels, than shall be payable on the same articles when imported or exported in British ves-

East-India trade regulated.

124
Liberty of commerce between the British European dominions and the U. States established.

TREATY WITH GREAT BRITAIN. 1794.
sels. But it is expressly agreed, that the vessels of the United States shall not carry any of the articles exported by them from the said British territories, to any port or place, except to some port or place in America, where the same shall be unladen, and such regulations shall be adopted by both parties, as shall from time to time be found necessary to enforce the due and faithful observance of this stipulation. It is also understood that the permission granted by this article, is not to extend to allow the vessels of the United States to carry on any part of the coasting-trade of the said British territories; but vessels going with their original cargoes, or part thereof, from one port of discharge to another, are not to be considered as carrying on the coasting-trade. Neither is this article to be construed to allow the citizens of the said states to settle or reside within the said territories, or to go into the interior parts thereof, without the permission of the British government established there; and if any transgression should be attempted against the regulations of the British government in this respect, the observance of the same shall and may be enforced against the citizens of America in the same manner as against British subjects or others transgressing the same rule. And the citizens of the United States, whenever they arrive in any port or harbour in the said territories, or if they should be permitted in manner aforesaid, to go to any other place therein, shall always be subject to the laws, government, and jurisdiction of what nature established in such harbour, port or place, according as the same may be. The citizens of the United States may also touch for refreshment at the island of St. Helena, but subject in all respects to such regulations as the British government may from time to time establish there.
ARTICLE XIV. There shall be between all the dominions of his Majesty in Europe and the territories of the United States, a reciprocal and perfect liberty of commerce and navigation. The people and inhabitants of the two countries respectively, shall have liberty freely and securely, and without hindrance and molestation, to come with their ships and cargoes to the lands, countries, cities, ports, places and rivers, within the dominions and territories aforesaid, to enter into the same, to resort there, and to remain and reside there, without any limitation of time. Also to hire and possess houses and ware-houses for the purposes of their commerce, and generally the merchants and traders on each side, shall enjoy the most complete protection and security for their commerce; but subject always as to what respects this article to the laws and statutes of the two countries respectively.

Regulations respecting duties on ships and merchandize.

ARTICLE XV. It is agreed that no other or higher duties shall be paid by the ships or merchandize of the one party in the ports of the other, than such as are paid by the like vessels or merchandize of all other nations. Nor shall any other or higher duty be imposed in one country on the importation of any articles the growth, produce or manufacture of the other, than are or shall be payable on the importation of the like articles being of the growth, produce, or manufacture of any other foreign country. Nor shall any prohibition be imposed on the exportation or importation of any articles to or from the territories of the two parties respectively, which shall not equally extend to all other nations. But the British government reserves to itself the right of imposing on American vessels entering into the British ports in Europe, a tonnage duty equal to that which shall be payable by British vessels in the ports of America: And also such duty as may be adequate to countervail the

TREATY WITH GREAT BRITAIN. 1794.

125

difference of duty now payable on the importation of European and Asiatic goods, when imported into the United States in British or in American vessels.
The two parties agree to treat for the more exact equalization of the duties on the respective navigation of their subjects and people, in such manner as may be most beneficial to the two countries. The arrangements for this purpose shall be made at the same time, with those mentioned at the conclusion of the twelfth article of this treaty, and are to be considered as a part thereof. In the interval it is agreed, that the United States will not impose any new or additional tonnage duties on British vessels, nor increase the now-subsisting difference between the duties payable on the importation of any articles in British or in American vessels.
ARTICLE XVI.
It shall be free for the two contracting parties, respectively to appoint consuls for the protection of trade, to reside in the dominions and territories aforesaid; and the said consuls shall enjoy those liberties and rights which belong to them by reason of their function. But before any consul shall act as such, he shall be in the usual forms approved and admitted by the party to whom he is sent; and it is hereby declared to be lawful and proper, that in case of illegal or improper conduct towards the laws or government, a consul may either be punished according to law, if the laws will reach the case, or be dismissed, or even sent back, the offended government assigning to the other their reasons
for the same. Either of the parties may except from the residence of consuls
such particular places, as such party shall judge proper to be so excepted.

Consuls may be appointed.

ARTICLE XVII.
It is agreed, that in all cases where vessels shall be captured or detained on just suspicion of having on board enemy's property, or of carrying to the enemy any of the articles which are contraband of war; the said vessel shall be brought to the nearest or most convenient port; and if any property of an enemy should be found on board such vessel, that part only which belongs to the enemy shall be made prize, and the vessel shall be at liberty to proceed with the remainder without any impediment. And it is agreed, that all proper measures shall be taken to prevent delay, in deciding the cases of ships or cargoes so brought in for adjudication; and in the payment or recovery of any indemnification, adjudged or agreed to be paid to the masters or owners of such ships.

How to proceed when vessels are captured on suspicion of having enemy's property, or contraband goods.

ARTICLE XVIII.
In order to regulate what is in future to be esteemed contraband of war, it is agreed, that under the said denomination shall be comprised all arms and implements serving for the purposes of war, by land or sea, such as cannon, muskets, mortars, petards, bombs, grenades, carcasses, saucisses, carriages for cannon, musket rests, bandoliers, gunpowder, match, saltpetre, ball, pikes, swords, head-pieces, cuirasses, halberts, lances, javelins, horse-furniture, holsters, belts, and generally all other implements of war; as also timber for ship-building, tar or rozin, copper in sheets, sails, hemp, and cordage, and generally whatever may serve directly to the equipment of vessels, unwrought iron and fir planks only excepted; and all the above articles are hereby declared to be just objects of confiscation, whenever they are attempted to be carried to an enemy.
And whereas the difficulty of agreeing on the precise cases in which
l2

What articles shall be deemed contraband.

120

TREATY WITH GREAT BRITAIN. 1794.

Stipulation respecting provisions becoming contraband.
Regulations respecting vessels attempting to enter a blockaded port, or found therein.
Privateering regulated.

alone provisions and other articles not generally contraband may be regarded as such, renders it expedient to provide against the inconveniences and misunderstandings which might thence arise: It is further agreed, that whenever any such articles so becoming contraband, according to the existing laws of nations, shall for that reason be seized, the same shall not be confiscated, but the owners thereof shall be speedily and completely indemnified; and the captors, or in their default, the government under whose authority they act, shall pay to the masters or owners of such vessels, the full value of all such articles, with a reasonable mercantile profit thereon, together with the freight, and also the demurrage incident to such detention.
And whereas it frequently happens that vessels sail for a port or place belonging to an enemy, without knowing that the same is either besieged, blockaded or invested; it is agreed, that every vessel so circumstanced, may be turned away from such port or place, but she shall not be detained, nor her cargo, if not contraband, be confiscated, unless after notice she shall again attempt to enter; but she shall be permitted to go to any other port or place she may think proper: Nor shall any vessel or goods of either party, that may have entered into such port or place, before the same was besieged, blockaded, or invested by the other, and be found therein after the reduction or surrender of such place, be liable to confiscation, but shall be restored to the owners or proprietors thereof.
ARTICLE XIX.
And that more abundant care may be taken for the security of the respective subjects and citizens of the contracting parties, and to prevent their suffering injuries by the men of war, or privateers of either party, all commanders of ships of war and privateers, and all others the said subjects and citizens, shall forbear doing any damage to those of the other party, or committing any outrage against them, and if they act to the contrary, they shall be punished, and shall also be bound in their persons and estates to make satisfaction and reparation for all damages, and the interest thereof, of whatever nature the said damages may be.
For this cause, all commanders of privateers, before they receive their commissions, shall hereafter be obliged to give, before a competent judge, sufficient security by at least two responsible sureties, who have no interest in the said privateer, each of whom, together with the said commander, shall be jointly and severally bound in the sum of fifteen hundred pounds sterling, or if such ships be provided with above one hundred and fifty seamen or soldiers, in the sum of three thousand pounds sterling, to satisfy all damages and injuries, which the said privateer, or her officers or men, or any of them may do or commit during their cruise, contrary to the tenor of this treaty, or to the laws and instructions for regulating their conduct; and further, that in all cases of aggressions, the said commissions shall be revoked and annulled.
It is also agreed that whenever a judge of a court of admiralty of either of the parties, shall pronounce sentence against any vessel, or goods or property belonging to the subjects or citizens of the other party, a formal and duly authenticated copy of all the proceedings in the cause, and of the said sentence, shall, if required, be delivered to the commander of the said vessel, without the smallest delay, he paying all legal fees and demands for the same.

ARTICLE XX. It is further agreed that both the said contracting parties, shall not only refuse to receive any pirates into any of their ports, havens, or towns, or permit any of their inhabitants to receive, protect, harbor,

TREATY WITH GREAT BRITAIN. 1794.

127

conceal or assist them in any manner, but will bring to condign punishment all such inhabitants as shall be guilty of such acts or offences.
And all their ships with the goods or merchandizes taken by them
and brought into the port of either of the said parties, shall be seized as far as they can be discovered, and shall be restored to the owners, or their factors or agents, duly deputed and authorized in writing by them
(proper evidence being first given in the court of admiralty for proving the property) even in case such effects should have passed into other
hands by sale, if it be proved that the buyers knew or had good reason to believe, or suspect that they had been piratically taken.

Pirates not to be protected; and goods taken by them to be restored.

ARTICLE XXL

It is likewise agreed, that the subjects and citizens of the two nations, shall not do any acts of hostility or violence against each other, nor accept commissions or instructions so to act from any foreign prince or state, enemies to the other party; nor shall the enemies of one of the parties be permitted to invite, or endeavour to enlist in their military service, any of the subjects or citizens of the other party; and the laws against all such offences and aggressions shall be punctually executed. And if any subject or citizen of the said parties respectively, shall accept any foreign commission, or letters of marque, for arming any
vessel to act as a privateer against the other party, and be taken by the other party, it is hereby declared to be lawful for the said party, to treat
and punish the said subject or citizen, having such commission or let-
ters of marque, as a pirate.

Subjects or citizens of one party shall not accept commission from a foreign state at war with the other.

ARTICLE XXII.
It is expressly stipulated, that neither of the said contracting parties will order or authorize any acts of reprisal against the other, on complaints of injuries or damages, until the said party shall first have presented to the other a statement thereof, verified by competent proof and evidence, and demanded justice and satisfaction, and the same shall either have been refused or unreasonably delayed.

No reprisal till demand of satisfaction and refusal.

ARTICLE XXIII.
The ships of war of each of the contracting parties shall, at all times, be hospitably received in the ports of the other, their officers and crews paying due respect to the laws and government of the country. The officers shall be treated with that respect which is due to the commissions which they bear, and if any insult should be offered to them by any of the inhabitants, all offenders in this respect shall be punished as disturbers of the peace and amity between the two countries. And his Majesty consents, that in case an American vessel should, by stress of weather, danger from enemies or other misfortune, be reduced to the necessity of seeking shelter in any of his Majesty's ports, into which such vessel could not in ordinary cases claim to be admitted, she shall, on manifesting that necessity to the satisfaction of the government of the place, be hospitably received and be permitted to refit, and to purchase at the market price, such necessaries as she may stand in need of, conformably to such orders and regulations as the government of the place, having respect to the circumstances of each case, shall prescribe. She shall not be allowed to break bulk or unload her cargo, unless the same shall be bona fide necessary to her being refitted. Nor shall be permitted to sell any part of her cargo, unless so much only as may be necessary to defray her expences, and then not without the express permission of the government of the place. Nor shall she be obliged to pay any duties whatever, except only on such articles as she may be permitted to sell for the purpose aforesaid.

Ships of war of each to be received in the ports of the other. American vessels, in case of stress of weather, may enter British ports.

128

TREATY WITH GREAT BRITAIN. 1794.

Foreign privateers not to arm in the ports of either nation, nor to sell their prizes.

ARTICLE XXIV. It shall not be lawful for any foreign privateers (not being subjects or citizens of either of the said parties) who have commissions from
any other prince or state in enmity with either nation, to arm their ships in the ports of either of the said parties, nor to sell what they have
taken, nor in any other manner to exchange the same; nor shall they be allowed to purchase more provisions, than shall be necessary for their
going to the nearest port of that prince or state from whom they ob-
tained their commissions.

Regulations respecting prizes and captures.
Privileges of the subjects and citizens of each party residing in the dominions of the other in case of a rupture.

ARTICLE XXV.
It shall be lawful for the ships of war and privateers belonging to the said parties respectively, to carry whithersoever they please, the ships and goods taken from their enemies, without being obliged to pay any fee to the officers of the admiralty, or to any judges whatever; nor shall the said prizes when they arrive at, and enter the ports of the said parties, be detained or seized, neither shall the searchers or other officers of those places visit such prizes, (except for the purpose of preventing the carrying of any part of the cargo thereof on shore in any manner contrary to the established laws of revenue, navigation or commerce) nor shall such officers take cognizance of the validity of such prizes; but they shall be at liberty to hoist sail, and depart as speedily as may be, and carry their said prizes to the place mentioned in their commissions or patents, which the commanders of the said ships of war or privateers shall be obliged to show. No shelter or refuge shall be given in their ports to such as have made a prize upon the subjects or citizens of either of the said parties; but if forced by stress of weather, or the dangers of the sea, to enter therein, particular care shall be taken to hasten their departure, and to cause them to retire as soon as possible. Nothing in this treaty contained shall, however, be construed or operate contrary to former and existing public treaties with other sovereigns or states. But the two parties agree, that while they continue in amity, neither of them will in future make any treaty that shall be inconsistent with this or the preceding article.
Neither of the said parties shall permit the ships or goods belonging to the subjects or citizens of the other, to be taken within cannon-shot of the coast, nor in any of the bays, ports, or rivers of their territories, by ships of war, or others having commission from any prince, republic, or state whatever. But in case it should so happen, the party whose territorial rights shall thus have been violated, shall use his utmost endeavours to obtain from the offending party, full and ample satisfaction for the vessel or vessels so taken, whether the same be vessels of war or merchant vessels.
ARTICLE XXVI.
If at any time a rupture should take place, (which God forbid) between his Majesty and the United States, the merchants and others of each of the two nations, residing in the dominions of the other, shall have the privilege of remaining and continuing their trade, so long as they behave peaceably, and commit no offence against the laws; and in case their conduct should render them suspected, and the respective governments should think proper to order them to remove, the term of twelve months from the publication of the order shall be allowed them for that purpose, to remove with their families, effects and property ; but this favour shall not be extended to those who shall act contrary to the established laws; and for greater certainty, it is declared, that such rupture shall not be deemed to exist, while negociations for accommodating differences shall be depending, nor until the respective ambassadors or ministers, if such there shall be, shall be recalled, or sent home on account of such differences, and not on account of personal

TREATY WITH GREAT BRITAIN. 1794.

misconduct, according to the nature and degrees of which, both parties retain their rights, either to request the recall, or immediately to send home the ambassador or minister of the other; and that without pre-
judice to their mutual friendship and good understanding.

ARTICLE XXVII.
It is further agreed, that his Majesty and the United States, on mutual requisitions, by them respectively, or by their respective ministers or officers authorized to make the same, will deliver up to justice all persons, who, being charged with murder or forgery, committed within the jurisdiction of either, shall seek an asylum within any of the countries of the other, provided that this shall only be done on such evidence of criminality, as, according to the laws of the place, where the fugitive or person so charged shall be found, would justify his apprehension and commitment for trial, if the offence had there been committed. The expence of such apprehension and delivery shall be borne and defrayed, by those who make the requisition and receive the fugitive.

Criminals to be delivered up to justice.

ARTICLE XXVIII.
It is agreed, that the first ten articles of this treaty shall be permanent, and that the subsequent articles, except the twelfth, shall be limited in their duration to twelve years, to be computed from the day on which the ratifications of this treaty shall be exchanged, but subject to this condition, That whereas the said twelfth article will expire by the limitation therein contained, at the end of two years from the signing of the preliminary or other articles of peace, which shall terminate the present war in which his Majesty is engaged, it is agreed, that proper measures shall by concert be taken, for bringing the subject of that article into amicable treaty and discussion, so early before the expiration of the said term, as that new arrangements on that head, may, by that time, be perfected, and ready to take place. But if it should unfortunately happen, that his Majesty and the United States should not be able to agree on such new arrangements, in that case, all the articles of this treaty, except the first ten, shall then cease and expire together.

Limitation.

Lastly. This treaty, when the same shall have been ratified by his Majesty, and by the President of the United States, by and with the advice and consent of their Senate, and the respective ratifications mutually exchanged, shall be binding and obligatory on his Majesty and on the said states, and shall be by them respectively executed, and observed, with punctuality and the most sincere regard to good faith; and whereas
it will be expedient, in order the better to facilitate intercourse and obviate difficulties, that other articles be proposed and added to this treaty,
which articles, from want of time and other circumstances, cannot now be perfected; it is agreed that the said parties will, from time to time, readily treat of and concerning such articles, and will sincerely endeavour so to form them, as that they may conduce to mutual convenience, and tend to promote mutual satisfaction and friendship; and that the said articles, after having been duly ratified, shall be added to, and make a part of this treaty. In faith whereof, we, the undersigned ministers plenipotentiary of his Majesty the King of Great-Britain, and the United States of America, have signed this present treaty, and have caused to be affixed thereto the seal of our arms.

No. 3. Enjoining Neutrality as to War against Erance.

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. April 22, 1793.

A PROCLAMATION.

Whe re as it appears that a state of war exists between Austria, Prussia, Sardinia, Great Britain, and the United Netherlands of the one part, and France on the other, and the duty and interest of the United States require that they should with sincerity and good faith adopt and pursue a conduct friendly and impartial toward the belligerent powers :
I have therefore thought fit, by these presents, to declare the disposition of the United States to observe the conduct aforesaid towards those powers respectively ; and to exhort and warn the citizens of the United States carefully to avoid all acts and proceedings whatsoever, which may in any manner tend to contravene such disposition.
And I do hereby also make known that whosoever of the citizens of the United States shall render himself liable to punishment or forfeiture under the law of nations, by committing, aiding, or abetting hostilities against any of the said powers, or by carrying to any of them those articles which are deemed contraband by the modern usage of nations, will not receive the protection of the United States against such punishment or forfeiture ; and further, that I have given instructions to those officers, to whom it belongs, to cause prosecutions to be instituted against all persons who shall, within the cognizance of the courts of the United States, violate the law of nations, with respect to the powers at war, or any of them.
In testimony whereof, I have caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed to these presents, and signed the same with
[l . s .] my hand. Done at the city of Philadelphia, the twenty-second day of April, one thousand seven hundred and ninety-three, and of the independence of the United States of America the seventeenth.

No. 4. Respecting enlisting Men in Kentucky to invade a neighboring Nation.

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA :· March 24,1794.

A PROCLAMATION.

Whe re as I have received information that certain persons, in violation of the laws, have presumed, under colour of a foreign authority, to enlist citizens of the United States, and others, within the State of Kentucky, and have there assembled an armed force for the purpose of invading and plundering the territories of a nation at peace with the said United States: And whereas such unwarrantable measures, being contrary to the laws of nations, and to the duties incumbent on every citizen of the United States, tend to disturb the tranquillity of the same, and to involve them 4n the calamities of war: And, whereas it is the duty of the executive to take care that such criminal proceedings should be suppressed, the offenders brought to justice, and all good citizens cautioned

against measures likely to prove so pernicious to their country and themselves, should they be seduced into similar infractions of the laws, I have therefore thought proper to issue this proclamation, hereby solemnly warning every person, not authorized by the laws, against enlisting any citizen or citizens of the United States, or levying troops, or assembling any persons within the United States for the purposes aforesaid, or proceeding in any manner to the execution thereof, as they will answer the same at their peril: And I do also admonish and require all citizens to refrain from enlisting, enrolling, or assembling themselves for such unlawful purposes, and from being in anywise concerned, aiding, or abetting therein, as they tender their own welfare, inasmuch as all lawful means will be strictly put in execution for securing obedience to the laws, and for punishing such dangerous and daring violations thereof.
And I do, moreover, charge and require all courts, magistrates, and other officers whom it may concern, according to their respective duties, to exert the powers in them severally vested, to prevent and suppress all such unlawful assemblages and proceedings, and to bring to condign punishment those who may have been guilty thereof, as they regard the due authority of government, and the peace and welfare of the United States.

In testimony whereof, I have caused the seal of the United States of Amer-
ica to be affixed to these presents, and signed the same with my

No. 5. Day of Public Thanksgiving appointed.
BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

A PROCLAMATION.

Thursday, Feb. 19, 1795, appointed as a day of Public Thanksgiving.

Whe n we review the calamities which afflict so many other nations, the present condition of the United States affords much matter of consolation and satisfaction. Our exemption hitherto from foreign war, an increasing prospect of the continuance of that exemption, the great degree of internal tranquillity we have enjoyed, the recent confirmation of that tranquillity by the suppression of an insurrection which so wantonly threatened it, the happy course of our public affairs in general, the unexampled prosperity of all classes of our citizens--are circumstances which peculiarly mark our situation with indications of the Divine Beneficence towards us. In such a state of things it is, in an especial manner, our duty as a people, with devout reverence and affectionate gratitude, to acknowledge our many and great obligations to Almighty God, and to implore Him
to continue and confirm the blessings we experience. Deeply penetrated with this sentiment, I, GEORGE WASHINGTON, Pres-
ident of the United States, do recommend to all religious societies and denominations, and to all persons whomsoever within the United States, to set apart and observe Thursday, the nineteenth day of February next, as a day of public Thanksgiving and Prayer ; and on that day to meet together, and render their sincere and hearty thanks to the great Ruler of Nations for the manifest and signal mercies which distinguish our lot as a Nation ; particularly for the possession of Constitutions of Government which unite and by their union establish liberty with order, for the preservation of our peace, foreign and domestic, for the seasonable controul which has been given to a spirit of disorder in the suppression of the late insurrection, and generally for the prosperous course of our affairs, public and private ; and at the same time, humbly and fervently to beseech the kind author of these blessings graciously to prolong them to us,--to imprint on our hearts a deep and solemn sense of our obligations to Him for them--to teach us rightly to estimate their immense value--to preserve us from the arrogance of prosperity, and from hazarding the advantages we enjoy by delusive pursuits--to dispose us to merit the continuance of his favors, by not abusing them, by our gratitude for
