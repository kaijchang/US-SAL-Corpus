ADVERTISEMENT .
IN publishing the following Laws, the same plan has been adopted that was prescribed in the Joint Resolution of Congress of March 3, 1845 , authorizing a subscription to the edition of all the Laws of the United States published by us. A close examination of this volume will disclose some apparent errors in the Laws as here printed ; but as we procure a careful collation with the records at Washington by an experienced reader of the Department of State, and scrupulously follow the original, any seeming errors must be attributed to the Rolls, and not to us. Where anything absolutely necessary to the sense is omitted in the Rolls, it is inserted in the text, enclosed in brackets.
We intend to publish annually, and as soon after the close of each Session of Congress as is possible, the Acts of that Session, in a similar form and with a similar arrangement.
It will be seen, by the following extracts from the Act of Congress, August 8, 1846 , and the Joint Resolutions of September 26 , 1850 , and March 31 , 1866 , that our edition has been sanctioned by Congress, and is the OFFICIAL EDITION.
" And whereas said edition of the said LAWS AND TREATIES OF THE UNITED STATES has been carefully collated and compared with the original Rolls in the Archives ofthe Govern ment, under the inspection and supervision ofthe Attorney-General ofthe United States, as duly certified by that officer : therefore, Be it further enacted, that said edition of the LAWS AND TREATIES OF THE UNITED STATES , published by LITTLE & BROWN, is hereby declared to be competent evidence of the several Public and Private Acts of Congress, and of the several Treaties therein contained, in all the Courts of Law and Equity and Maritime Jurisdiction, and in all the Tribunals and Public Offices of the United States and of the several States, without anyfurther proof or authentication thereof." - APPROVED, August 8, 1846.
" Resolved by the. Senate and House of Representatives of the United States ofAmerica in Congress assembled, That the Secretary of State be authorized and directed to contract with LITTLE & BROWN to furnish their annual Statutes at Large, printed in conformity with the plan adopted b Congress in eighteen hundred and forty-five, instead of the edition usually issued by his or ler, under the act of Congress of April twentieth, eighteen hundred and eighteen, and which conforms to an edition of the laws now out of use.' APPROVED, September 26, 1850.
"Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the Secretary of State be, and he is hereby, authorized and directed to renew the contract of October thirty-first, eighteen hundred and fifty, between the Department of State and LITTLE, Brown, and COMPANY, of Boston, Massachusetts, for the annual publication of the Statutes at Large of the United States until otherwise ordered by Congress, in conformity with the joint resolutions approved respectively March third , eighteen hundred and forty-five, and September thirtieth [ twenty-sixth], eighteen hundred and fifty." -- ApPROVED, March 31 , 1866.

PREAMBLE.
Whereas existing treaties between the United States and the Seminole nation are insufficient to meet their mutual necessities ; and whereas the Seminole nation made a treaty with the so-called confederate states, August 1st, 1861 , whereby they threw off their allegiance to the United States, and unsettled their treaty relations with the United States, and thereby incurred the liability of forfeiture of all lands and other property held by grant or gift of the United States ; and whereas a treaty of peace and amity was entered into between the United States and the Seminole and other tribes at Fort Smith, September 10, 1865, whereby the Seminoles revoked, cancelled, and repudiated the said treaty with the so-called confederate states ; and whereas the United States, through its commissioners, in said treaty of peace, promised to enter into treaty with the Seminole nation to arrange and settle all questions relating to and growing out of said treaty with the so-called confederate states ; and whereas the United States, in view of said treaty of the Seminole nation with the enemies of the government of the United States, and the consequent liabilities of said Seminole nation, and in view of its urgent necessities for more lands in the Indian territory, requires a cession by said Seminole nation of a part of its present reservation, and is willing to pay therefor a reasonable price, while at the same time providing new and adequate lands for them.
Now, therefore, the United States, by its commissioners aforesaid, and the above-named delegates of the Seminole nation, the day and year above written, mutually stipulate and agree, on behalf of the respective parties, as follows, to wit :
ARTICLE I. There shall be perpetual peace between the United Peace and States and the Seminole nation, and the Seminoles agree to be and re- friendship. main firm allies of the United States, and always faithfully aid the gov-

country, and protection against hostilities on the part of other tribes ; and

in the event of such hostilities, that the tribe commencing and prosecuting

States, committed by any member of the Seminole nation, is hereby declared ; and the Seminoles, anxious for the restoration of kind and friend-

ly feelings among themselves, do hereby declare an amnesty for all past

offences against their government, and no Indian or Indians shall be pro-

scribed, or any act of forfeiture or confiscation passed against those who

have remained friendly to or taken up arms against the United States, but they shall enjoy equal privileges with other members of said tribe,

and all laws heretofore passed inconsistent herewith are hereby declared

inoperative.

ing upon all persons of whatever race or color who may be adopted as citizens or members of said tribe.

paying into the treasury of the particular nation the price of the land as fixed by the respective legislatures, exclusive of the value of said im-

provement, shall receive a conveyance thereof. Such occupaut shall not be prejudiced thereby in his right to his selection elsewhere. The town

lots which may be unoccupied shall be disposed of for the benefit of the
particular nation, as the legislative authorities may direct from time to time. When the number of occupants of the same quarter-section shall

not be such as to authorize the legislative authorities to lay out the same,

or any part thereof, into town lots, they may make such regulations for

the disposition thereof as they may deem proper, either by subdivision of

the same, so as to accommodate the actual occupants, or by giving the right of prior choice to the first occupant in point of time, upon paying

the others for their improvements, to be valued in such way as the legis lative authorities shall prescribe, or otherwise. All occupants retaining

their lots under this section, and desiring, in addition, to make a selection,

must pay for the lots so retained, as in the case of town lots. And any

And whereas, by another proclamation, made on the sixteenth day of August, Vol. xii. p. 1262 in the same year , in pursuance of an act of Congress approved July thirteen, 1861 , ch. 8, 15.
Vol. xii. p. 257. one thousand eight hundred and sixty-one, the inhabitants of the States of Georgia, South Carolina, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama, Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Florida (except the inhabitants of that part of the State of Virginia lying west of the Alleghany Mountains, and of such other parts of that State and the other States before named , as might maintain a loyal adhesion to the Union and the Constitution, or might be from time to time occupied and controlled by forces of the United States engaged in the dispersion of insurgents) were declared to be in a state of insurrection against the United States ;
And whereas, by another proclamation, of the first day of July, one thou- Vol. xii. p. 1266. sand eight hundred and sixty-two, issued in pursuance of an act of Congress approved June seven, in the same year, the insurrection was declared to be still existing in the States aforesaid, with the exception of certain specified counties in the State of Virginia ;

Preamble.

And whereas the Senate of the United States, on the twenty-fifth day of

July, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-one, adopted a resolution in the words following, to wit : - -

" Resolved, That the present deplorable civil war has been forced upon the country by the disunionists of the Southern States, now in revolt against the

Constitutional government, and in arms around the capital ; that in this na-

tional emergency, Congress, banishing all feeling of mere passion or resentment, will recollect only its duty to the whole country ; that this war is not prosecuted

upon our part in any spirit of oppression nor for any purpose of conquest or sub-

jugation, nor purpose of overthrowing or interfering with the rights or established institutions of those States, but to defend and maintain the supremacy of

the Constitution and all laws made in pursuance thereof, and to preserve the

Union with all the dignity, equality, and rights of the several States unimpaired ; that as soon as these objects are accomplished the war ought to cease. "

And whereas these resolutions, though not joint or concurrent in form, are substantially identical, and as such may be regarded as having expressed the sense of Congress upon the subject to which they relate ;

Vol. xiii. p. 763. And whereas, by my proclamation of the thirteenth day of June last, the insurrection in the State of Tennessee was declared to have been suppressed, the

authority of the United States therein to be undisputed, and such United States

officers as had been duly commissioned to be in the undisturbed exercise of their official functions ;

And whereas there now exists no organized armed resistance of misguided

citizens or others to the authority of the United States in the States of Georgia,

South Carolina, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama, Louisiana, Ar-

kansas, Mississippi, and Florida, and the laws can be sustained and enforced

therein by the proper civil authority, State or Federal, and the people of said States are well and loyally disposed, and have conformed or will conform in their

legislation to the condition of affairs growing out of the amendment to the Constitution ofthe United States, prohibiting slavery within the limits and jurisdiction of the United States ;

And whereas, in view ofthe before-recited premises, it is the manifest deter-

mination of the American people that no State, of its own will, has the right or

the power to go out of, or separate itself from, or be separated from the American Union, and that therefore each State ought to remain and constitute an integral part of the United States ;

And whereas the people of the several before-mentioned States have, in the

manner aforesaid, given satisfactory evidence that they acquiesce in this sove-

reign and important resolution of national unity ; And whereas it is believed to be a fundamental principle of government that
people who have revolted, and who have been overcome and subdued, must

either be dealt with so as to induce them voluntarily to become friends, or else they must be held by absolute military power, or devastated, so as to prevent them from ever again doing harm as enemies, which last-named policy is abhorrent to humanity and to freedom ;
And whereas the Constitution of the United States provides for constitu-

ent communities only as States, and not as Territories, dependencies, provinces, or protectorates ;
And whereas such constituent States must necessarily be, and by the Constitution and laws of the United States are made equals, and placed upon a like

footing as to political rights, immunities, dignity, and power with the several States with which they are united ;

And whereas the observance of political equality as a principle of right and

justice is well calculated to encourage the people of the aforesaid States to be and become more and more constant and persevering in their renewed allegiance ;
And whereas standing armies, military occupation, martial law, military tribunals , and the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus are, in time of peace, dangerous to public liberty, incompatible with the individual

rights of the citizen, contrary to the genius and spirit of our free institutions, and exhaustive of the national resources, and ought not, therefore, to be sanc-

tioned or allowed, except in cases of actual necessity, for repelling invasion or

suppressing insurrection or rebellion ;

And whereas the policy of the government ofthe United States, from the be-

ginning of the insurrection to its overthrow and final suppression, has been in conformity with the principles herein set forth and enumerated ;

Now, therefore, I, ANDREW JOHNSON, president of the United States, do

hereby proclaim and declare that the insurrection which heretofore existed in

Mexico, has issued a decree in regard to the port of Matamoras, and other Mexican ports which are in the occupation and possession of another of the said belligerents, namely, the United States of Mexico, which decree is in the following words :-

" The port of Matamoras, and all those of the northern frontier which have withdrawn from their obedience to the government, are closed to foreign and

coasting traffic during such time as the empire of the law shall not be therein reinstated.

" ART. 2d. Merchandise proceeding from the said ports, on arriving at any other where the excise of the Empire is collected, shall pay the duties on im-

NATIONAL THANKSGIVING.

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES [ OF AMERICA :] Oct. 8, 1866.

A PROCLAMATION.

ALMIGHTY GOD, our heavenly Father, has been pleased to vouchsafe to us, Thursday,

as a people, another year of that national life which is an indispensable con- Nov. 29, 1866,

dition of peace, security, and progress. That year has, moreover, been crowned oafpptohianntkesdgaivdianyg

with many peculiar blessings.

and praise.

The civil war that so recently closed among us has not been anywhere

reopened. Foreign intervention has ceased to excite alarm or apprehension.

Intrusive pestilence has been benignly mitigated. Domestic tranquillity has

improved , sentiments of conciliation have largely prevailed, and affections of

loyalty and patriotism have been widely renewed. Our fields have yielded

quite abundantly. Our mining industry has been richly rewarded, and we have been allowed to extend our railroad system far into the interior recesses

of the country, while our commerce has resumed its customary activity in foreign seas.

These great national blessings demand a national acknowledgment. Now, therefore, I, ANDREW JOHNSON, President of the United States, do

hereby recommend that Thursday, the twenty-ninth day of November next, be set apart and be observed everywhere in the several States and Territories of the

United States by the people thereof as a day of thanksgiving and praise to

Almighty GOD, with due remembrance that " in His temple doth every man

speak of His honor." I recommend, also, that, on the same solemn occasion, they do humbly and devoutly implore Him to grant to our National Councils and to our whole people that divine wisdom which alone can lead any nation into the ways of all good.
In offering these national thanksgivings, praises and supplications, we have the divine assurance that " the Lord remaineth a King forever ; them that are meek shall He guide in judgment, and such as are gentle shall He learn His
way. The Lord shall give strength to His people, and the Lord shall give to His people the blessing of peace.'

last by the legation of the United States in Japan, through the consulates of

the coasts of Suwo and Nagato pending the then contemplated hostilities between the Tycoon of Japan and the Daimio of the said provinces :

And whereas authentic information having been received by the said

in that country except the three opened ports, viz : Kanagawa, (Yokohama,) Nagasaki, and Hakodate, unless in distress or forced by stress of weather, as

provided by treaty, and giving notice that masters of vessels committing a breach of the regulation would thereby render themselves liable to prosecution

and punishment, and also to forfeiture of the protection of the United States, if the visit to such non-opened port or roadstead should either involve a breach of treaty or be construed as an act in aid of insurrection or rebellion :
