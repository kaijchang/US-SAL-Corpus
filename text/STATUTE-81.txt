JOINT RESOLUTION To support emerjiency food a.ssistance to India.

April i, i967 [H. j . Res. 267]

Whereas the Congress has dechired it to be the policy of the United States to combat hunger and malnutrition and to encourage economic development in the developing countries; and
Whereas two years of drought have caused a grave food shortage in India which threatens the lives and health of millions of people; and
Whereas the urgency of the need of the Indian people and the time needed for congressional deliberation have required the United States already to commit three million six hundred thousand tons of grain valued at $275,000,000 as a part of the eight to ten million tons of grain estimated to be required during the calendar year 1967 from outside India to prevent irreparable hardship to the people of India; and
Whereas the programs of economic and agricultural development which have been launched by the Government of India would be seriously impaired if the international community failed to act promptly and on an adequate scale to meet the urgent needs of the people of India: Therefore be it

Resolved hy the Sena.te and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress asserribled^ T h a t the Congress approves India. the participation of the United States in cooperation with other assistance. Emergency food countries and with multilateral organizations, including the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the Food and Agriculture Organization, and others, in urgent international efforts designed to--

(a) develop a comprehensive self-help approach to the wa,r on hunger based on a fair sharing of the burden among the nations of the world;

(b) encourage and assist the Government of India in achieving food self-sufficiency; and

(c) help meet India's critical food and nutritional needs by making available agricultural commodities or other resources needed for food procurement or production.

Because uncertainty in connection with Public Law 480 transactions tends to depress market prices, it is the sense of Congress that, in carrying out this Aid to India program, the Administration should, subject to the requirement of section 401 of Public Law 480 with respect to the availability of the commodity at the time of exportation, make announcements of intention, purchases and shipments of commodities on schedules and under circumstances w^hich will protect and strengthen farm market prices to the maximum extent possible.

Further, the Congress recommends, on the basis of estimates now available, that the United States provide an additional amount of food grain not to exceed three million tons at an estimated cost of $190,000,000 as the LTnited States share toward meeting the India food deficit, provided it is appropriately matched, and specifically extends its support to the allocation of approximately $190,000,000 of funds

Any person who is in a deferred status under the provisions of subsection (i) of this section after attaining the nineteenth anniversary of the date of his birth, or who requests and is granted a student deferment under this paragraph, shall, upon the termination of .juch deferred status or deferment, and if qualified, be liable for induction as a registrant within the prime age group irrespective of his actual age, unless he is otherwise deferred under one of the exceptions specified in the preceding sentence. As used in this subsection, the term 'prime age group' means the age group which has been designated by the President as the age group from which selections for induction into the Armed Forces are first to be made after delinquents and volunteers.
"(2) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection the President is authorized, under such rules and regulations as he may prescribe, to piovide for the deferment from training and service in the Armed Forces of any or all categories of persons whose employment in indus-

This proviso shall not be construed to prevent the continued deferment of such persons if otherwise deferrable under any other provisions of this Act. The President is also authorized, under such rules and regulations as he may prescribe, to provide for the deferment from training and service in the Armed Forces (1) of any or all categories of persons in a status with respect to persons (other than wives alone, except in cases of extreme hardship) dependent upon them for support which renders their deferment advisable, and (2) of any or all categories of those persons found to be physically, mentally, or morally deficient or defective. For the purpose of determining whether or not the deferment of any person is advisable, because of his status with respect to persons dependent upon him for support, any payments of allowances which are payable by the United States to the dependents of persons serving in the Armed Forces of the United States shall be taken into consideration, but the fact that such payments of allowances are payable shall not be deemed conclusively to remove the grounds for deferment when the dependency is based upon financial considerations and shall not be deemed to remove the ground for deferment when the dependency is based upon other than financial considerations and cannot be eliminated by financial assistance to the dependents. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the President is also authorized, under such rules and regulations as he may prescribe, to provide for the deferment from training and service in the Armed Forces of any or all categories of persons who have children, or wives and children, with whom they maintain a bona fide family relationship in their homes. No deferment from such training and service in the Armed Forces shall be made in the case of any individual except uj)on the basis of the status of such individual. There shall be posted in a conspicuous place at the office of each local board a list setting forth the names and classifications of those persons who have been classified by such local board. The President may, in carrying out the provisions of this title, recommend criteria for the classification of persons subject to induction under this title, and to the extent that such action is determined by the President to be consistent with the national interest, recommend that such criteria be administered uniformly throughout the United States whenever practicable; except that no local board, appeal board, or other agency of appeal of the Selective Service System shall be required to postpone or defer any person by reason of his activity in study, research, or medical, dental, veterinary, optometric, osteopathic, scientific, pharmaceutical, chiropractic, chiropodial, or other endeavors found to be necessary to the maintenance of the national health, safety, or interest solely on the basis of any test, examination, selection system, class standing, or any other means conducted, sponsored, administered, or prepared by any agency or department of the Federal Government,

regiou. The provisions of title 23, United States Code, that are applicable to the construction and maintenance of Federal-aid primary and secondary highways, and which the Secretar;^ determines are not inconsistent with this Act, shall apply, respectively, to the development highway system and the local access roads. Construction on the development highway system shall not exceed two thousand seven hundred miles. Construction of local access roads shall not exceed one thousand six hundred miles that will serve specific recreational, residential, educational, commercial, industrial, or other like facilities or
will facilitate a school consolidation program. "(b) The Commission shall transmit to the Secretary its designa-
tions of (1) the general corridor location and termini of the development highways, (2) local access roads to be constructed, (3) priorities for the construction of segments of the development highways, and (4) other criteria for the program authorized by this section. Before any State member participates in or votes on such designations, he shall have obtained the recommendations of the State highway department of the State which he represents.
"(c) In no event shall the Secretary assist in any construction (in-
cluding right-of-way acquisition) which would require for its completion the expenditure of Federal funds (other than funds available under title 23, United States Code) in excess of the appropriations authorization in subsection (g). On its completion each development highway not already on the Federal-aid primary system shall be added to such system and each development highway and local access road shall be required to be maintained by the State as provided for Federal-aid highways in title 23, United States Code.
"(d) I n the construction of highways and roads authorized under this section, the States may give special preference to the. use of materials and products indigenous to the Appalachian region.

No program or project authorized under this section shall be implemented until (1) applications and plans relating to the program or project have been determined by the responsible Federal official to be compatible with the provisions and objectives of Federal laws which he administers that are not inconsistent with this Act, and (2) the Regional Commission involved has approved such program or project and has determined that it meets the applicable criteria under section 504 and will contribute to the development of the region, which determination shall be controlling. Funds may be provided only for Federal grant-in-aid programs for which funds are available under the Act authorizing such programs. Funds so provided shall be available without regard to any appropriation authorization ceilings in such Act.
"(b) The Federal portion of such costs shall not be increased in excess of the percentages established by each commission, and shall in no event exceed 80 per centum thereof.
"(c) The term 'Federal grant-in-aid programs' as used in this section means all Federal grant-in-aid programs in existence on or before December 31, 1967, assisting in the acquisition of land or the construction or equipment of facilities, including but not limited to grant-in-aid programs authorized by title I of this Act and by the following Acts: Federal Water Pollution Control Act; Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act; title V I of the Public Health Service Act; Vocational Education Act of 1963; Library Services Act; Federal Airport Act; part I V of title I I I of the Communications Act of 1934; Higher Education Facilities Act of 1963; Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965; and National Defense Education Act of 1958. The term shall not include any program in which loans or other Federal financial assistance, except a grant-in-aid program, is authorized by this or any other Act. Grants under this section shall be made solely out of funds specifically appropriated for the purpose of carrying out this section, and shall not be taken into account in the computation of allocations among the States made pursuant to any other provision of law.
"(d) There is hereby authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary for each of the regional commissions for the purposes of this section the sum of $5,000,000 for the period ending June 30, 1968, and the sum of $10,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30,1969.

CHAPTER 1--POLICY
SEC. 101. Section 102 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, which relates to the statement of policy, is amended to read as follows:
"SEC. 102. STATEMENT OF POLICY.--The Congress declares that the freedom, security, and prosperity of the United States are best sustained in a community of free, secure, and prospering nations. In particular, the Congress recognizes the threat to world peace posed by aggression and subversion wherever they occur, and that ignorance, want, and despair breed the extremism and violence which lead to aggression and subversion. The Congress declares therefore that it is not only expressive of our sense of freedom, justice, and compassion but also important to our national security that the United States, through private as well as public etl'orts, assist the people of less developed countries in their efforts to acquire the knowledge and resources essential for development and to build the economic, political, and social institutions which will meet their aspirations for a better life, with freedom, and in peace.

^s stat_. 424^.

446 '

PUBLIC LAW 90-137-NOV. 14, 1967

" I n addition, the Congress declares that it is the policy of the United States to support the principles of increased economic cooperation and trade among countries, freedom of the press, information, and religion, freedom of navigation in international waterways, and recognition of the right of all private persons to travel and pursue their lawful activities without discrimination as to race or religion. The Congress further declares that any distinction made by foreign nations between American citizens because of race, color, or religion in the granting of, or the exercise of, personal or other rights available to American citizens is repugnant to our principles.
"The Congress further declares that to achieve the objectives of this Act, programs authorized by this Act should be carried out in accordance with the following principles:
"First, development is primarily the responsibility of the people of the less developed countries themselves. Assistance from the United States shall be used in support of, rather than substitution for, the self-help efforts that are essential to successful development programs, and shall be concentrated in those countries that take positive steps to help themselves. Maximum effort shall be made, in the administration of this Act, to stimulate the involvement of the people in the development process through the encouragement of democratic participation in private and local governmental activities and institution-building appropriate to the requirements of the recipient nations.
"Second, the tasks of successful development in some instances require the active involvement and cooperation of many countries on a multilateral basis. Therefore, to the maximum extent practicable, other countries shall be encouraged to increase their contributions to development programs and projects so that the cost of such common undertakings, which are for the benefit of all, may be shared equitably by all.
"Third, assistance shall be utilized to encourage regional cooperation by less developed countries in the solution of common problems and the development of shared resources.
"Fourth, the first objects of assistance shall be to support the efforts of less developed countries to meet the fundamental needs of their peoples for sufficient food, good health, home ownership and decent housing, and the opportunity to gain the basic knowledge and skills required to make their own way forward to a brighter future. In supporting these objectives, particular emphasis shall be placed on utilization of resources for food production and voluntary family planning.
"Fifth, assistance shall wherever practicable be constituted of United States commodities and services furnished in a manner consistent with other eff'orts of the United States to improve its balance of payments position.
"Sixth, assistance shall be furnished in such a manner as to promote efficiency and economy in operations so that the United States obtains maximum possible effectiveness for each dollar spent.

81 STAT.]

PUBLIC LAW 90-137-NOV. 14, 1967

"Seventh, to the maximum extent practicable, the furnishing of agri-

cultural commodities, disposal of excess property, and United States

payments to international lending institutions, undertaken pursuant

to this or any other Act, shall complement and be coordinated with

assistance provided under this part.

" I t is the sense of the Congress that every effort must be made to

...

J

,i-/r'in-i->imii

i

obtain a permanent peace m the Middle Jiiast. To help promote that

objective, the United States should encourage, as part of pacific settle-

ment, direct talks among the parties concerned, using such third party

or United Nations assistance as they may wish. To this end, the Presi-

dent should undertake immediately (1) a thorough review of the needs

of the several countries of that area, and (2) a reevaluation of United

States policies aimed at helping meet those needs and securing a

permanent peace in the area,

" I t is further the sense of the Congress that in any case in which any

foreign country has severed diplomatic relations with the United

States, the President should suspend assistance to such country under

this or any other Act, including any program designed to complement

assistance under this Act (such as sales of agricultural commodities

under the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of

1954). When diplomatic relations are resumed, a further study should

be made on a country-by-country basis to determine whether United

States foreign policy objectives would be served by extending assist-

ance under this or any other Act, including any program designed

to complement such assistance."

climate for private enterprise and investment, both domestic and

j foreign;

"(c) the extent to which the government of the country is

''i increasing the role of the people in the developmental process;

"(d) the extent to which the country's governmental expendi-

7 tures are allocated to key developmental areas, including agri-

culture, health, and education, and not diverted for unnecessary

military purposes or to intervention in the affairs of other free

> and independent nations;

"(e) the extent to which the country is willing to make contri-

!= butions of its own to the projects and programs for which the

assistance is provided;

"(f) the extent to which the country is making economic, social,

and political reforms, such as tax collection improvements and

changes in land tenure arrangements, that will enable it to achieve

developmental objectives more efficiently and justly; and

responsiveness to the vital economic, political, and social concerns

of its people, and demonstrating a clear determination to take

effective self-help measures.

"SEC. 209. MULTILATERAL AND REGIONAL PROGRAMS.-- (a) M U L T I -

LATERAL PROGRAMS.--The Congress recognizes that planning and ad-

;/

ministration of development assistance by, or under the sponsorship of,

multilateral lending institutions and other international organizations

may, in some instances, contribute to the efficiency and effectiveness of

that assistance through participation of other donors in the develop-

ment effort, improved coordination of policies and programs, pooling

of knowledge, avoidance of duplication of facilities and manpower,

and greater encouragement of self-help performance.

" ( b ) REGIONAL PROGRAMS.--It is further the sense of the Congress

(1) that where problems or opportunities are common to two or more

countries in a region, in such fields as agriculture, education, transpor-

tation, communications, power, watershed development, disease con-

trol, and establishment of development banks, these countries often can

more effectively resolve such problems and exploit such opportunities

by joining together in regional organizations or working together on

regional programs, (2) that assistance often can be utilized more

efficiently in regional programs than in separate country programs,

and (3) that to the maximum extent practicable consistent with the

purposes of this Act assistance under this Act should be furnished so

as to encourage less developed countries to cooperate with each other

in regional development programs."

located in its rapidly expanding metropolitan and other urban areas, which generally cross the boundary lines of local jurisdictions and often extend into two or more States;
" (2) that the growth in the amount and complexity of air pollution brought about by urbanization, industrial development, and the increasing use of motor vehicles, has resulted in mounting dangers to the public health and welfare, including injury to agricultural crops and livestock, damage to and the deterioration of property, and hazards to air and ground transportation;
"(3) that the prevention and control of air pollution at its source is the primary responsibility of States and local governments; and
" (4) that Federal financial assistance and leadership is essential for the development of cooperative Federal, State, regional, and local programs to prevent and control air pollution. " ( b ) The purposes of this title are--
"(1) to protect and enhance the quality of the Nation's air resources so as to promote the public health and welfare and the productive capacity of its population;
" (2) to initiate and accelerate a national research and development program to achieve the prevention and control of air pollution;
"(3) to provide technical and financial assistance to State and local governments in connection with the development and execution of their air pollution prevention and control programs; and

"Whereas, The federal Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention -^^^ of 1954, as amended, authorizes, under certain circumstances, federal assistance to local organizations in preparing and carrying out undertakings for flood prevention and the conservation, development, utilization and disposal of water in w^atershed or subwatershed areas; and

SEC. 2. Meat and meat food products are an important source of the Nation's total supply of food. They are consumed throughout the Nation and the major portion thereof moves in interstate or foreign commerce. It is essential in the public interest that the health and welfare of consumers be protected by assuring that meat and meat food |~iroducts distributed to them are wholesome, not adulterated, and properly marked, labeled, and packaged. Unwholesome, adulterated, or misbranded meat or meat food products impair the effective regulation of meat and meat food products in interstate or foreign commerce, are injurious to the public welfare, destroy markets for wholesome, not adulterated, and properly labeled and packaged meat and meat food products, and result in sundry losses to livestock producers and processors of meat and meat food products, as well as injury to consumers. The unwholesome, adulterated, mislabeled, or deceptively

"(c) (1) If the Secretary has reason to believe, by thirty days prior to the expiration of two years after enactment of the Wholesome Meat Act, that a State has failed to develop or is not enforcing, with respect to all establishments within its jurisdiction (except those that would be exempted from Federal inspection under subparagraph (2)) at which cattle, sheep, swine, goats, or equines are slaughtered, or their carcasses, or parts or products thereof, are prepared for use as human food, solely for distribution within such State, and the products of such establishments, requirements at least equal
to those imposed under title I and I V of this Act, he shall promptly notify the Governor of the State of this fact. If the Secretary determines, after consultation with the Governor of the State, or representative selected by him, that such requirements have not been developed and activated, he shall promptly after the expiration of such two-year period designate such State as one in which the provisions of titles I and I V of this Act shall apply to operations and transactions wholly within such State: Provided^ That if the Secretary has reason to believe that the State will activate such requirements within one additional year, he may delay such designation for said period, and not designate the State, if he determines at the end of the year that the State then has such requirements in effective operation. The Secretary shall publish any such designation in the Federal Register and, upon the expiration of thirty days after such publication, the provisions of titles I and I V shall apply to operations and transactions and to persons, firms, and corporations engaged therein in the State to the same extent and in the same manner as if such operations and transactions were conducted in or for commerce. Thereafter, upon request of the Governor, the Secretary shall revoke such designation if the Secretary determines that such State has developed and will enforce requirements at least equal to those imposed under title I and title I V of this Act: And provided further^ That, notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if the Secretary determines that any establishment within a State is producing adulterated meat or meat food products for distribution within such State which would clearly endanger the public health he shall notify the Governor of the State and the appropriate Advisory Committee provided by section 301 of
^he Act of such fact for effective action under State or local law. If the State does not take action to prevent such endangering of the public health within a reasonable time after such notice, as determined by the Secretary, in light of the risk to public healtli, the Secretary may forthwith designate any such establishment as subject to the provisions of titles I and I V of the Act, and thereupon the establishment and operator thereof shall be subect to such provisions as though engaged in commerce until such time as the Secretary determines that such State has developed and will enforce requirements at least equal to those imposed under title I and title I V of this Act.
(2) The provisions of this Act requiring inspection of the slaughter of animals and the preparation of carcasses, parts thereof, meat and meat food products shall not apply to operations of types traditionally and usually conducted at retail stores and restaurants, when conducted at any retail store or restaurant or similar retail-type establishment for sale in normal retail quantities or service of such articles to consumers at such establishments if such establishments are subject to such inspection provisions only under this paragraph (c).

(4) The Secretary shall promptly upon enactment of the Wholesome Meat Act and periodically thereafter, but at least annually, review the requirements, including the enforcement thereof, of the several States not designated under this paragraph (c), with respect to the slaughter, and the preparation, storage, handling and distribution of carcasses, parts thereof, meat and meat food products, of such animals, and inspection of such operations, and annually report thereon to the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture and Forestry of the Senate in the report required under section 17 of the Wholesome Meat Act.

This section shall not affect in any way other provisions of this Act for withdrawal of inspection services under title I from establishments failing to maintain sanitary conditions or to destroy condemned carcasses, parts, meat or meat food products.
"For the purpose of this section a person shall be deemed to be responsibly connected with the business if he was a partner, officer, director, holder, or owner of 10 per centum or more of its voting stock or employee in a managerial or executive capacity.
"The determination and order of the Secretary with respect thereto under this section shall be final and conclusive unless the affected applicant for, or recipient of, inspection service files application for judicial review within thirty days after the effective date of such order in the appropriate court as provided in section 404.

STATEMENT OF FINDINGS AND PURPOSE
SEC. 2. (a) The Congress hereby finds and declares that^-- (1) in the face of rising productivity and affluence, older
workers find themselves disadvantaged in their efforts to retain employment, and especially to regain employment when displaced from jobs;
(2) the setting of arbitrary age limits regardless of potential for job performance has become a common practice, and certain otherwise desirable practices may work to the disadvantage of older persons j
(3) the incidence of unemployment, especially long-term unemployment with resultant deterioration of skill, morale, and employer acceptability is, relative to the younger ages, high among older workers; their numbers are great and growing; and their employment problems grave;
(4) the existence in industries affecting commerce, of arbitrary discrimination in employment because of age, burdens commerce and the free flow of goods in commerce. (b) I t is therefore the purpose of this Act to promote employment of older persons based on their ability rather than age; to prohibit arbitrary age discrimination in employment; to help employers and workers find ways of meeting problems arising from the impact of age on employment.

fourth class in salary level 6 of the Postal Field Service Schedule; and
"(2) establish, and adjust from time to time, the annual rate of basic compensation, for each such position of postmaster so ranked, in an amount which bears the same ratio to the annual rate of basic compensation for full-time service in a position (other than postmaster at a post office of the fourth class) in the same step of salary level 6 of such schedule, as the average number of hours of service per day which the Postmaster General determines necessary to be performed by such postmaster to operate the post office, in the light of the postal needs of the patrons of the office, bears to the total number of hours per day of such full-time service. Actions and determinations by the Postmaster General under this subsection shall be final and conclusive until changed by him.
" ( b ) A person who performs the duties of postmaster at a post office of the fourth class where there is a vacancy, or during the absence of the postmaster on sick or annual leave or leave without pay, shall be compensated at the rate of basic compensation for step 1 of salary level 6 of the Postal Field Service Schedule, determined under subsection (a) of this section.
"(c) When required by the Postmaster General, a postmaster at a fourth-class office shall, and any other postmaster in P F S level 6 when permitted by the Postmaster General may, furnish quarters, fixtures, and equipment for an office on an allowance basis. The allowance for this purpose shall be an amount equal to 15 per centum of the basic compensation for step 1 of salary level 6 of the Postal Field Service Schedule, determined under subsection (a) of this section.".
(d) Each postmaster at a post office of the fourth class on the effective date of Postal Field Service Schedule I shall be placed in salary level 6 of the Postal Field Service Schedule at the lowest step which provides a rate, determined under section 3544(a) of title 39, United States Code, which is at least equal to his rate of basic compensation in effect immediately prior to such effective date plus 6 per centum thereof. If there is no such step in salary level 6, he is entitled to his rate of basic compensation in effect immediately prior to such effective date plus 6 per centum thereof. F o r the purposes of this subsection, basic compensation in effect immediately prior to the effective date of Postal Field Service Schedule I shall be determined after giving effect to any change in salary step or revenue units category which would have occurred on the effective date of this section without regard to the enactment of this title.

"(2) the better organization of a range of services related to the needs of the poor, so that these services may be made more effective and efficient in helping families and individuals to overcome particular problems in a way that takes account of, and supports their progress in overcoming, related problems;
"(3) the greater use, subject to adequate evaluation, of newtypes of services and innovative approaches in attacking causes of poverty, so as to develop increasingly effective methods of employing available resources;
"(4) the development and implementation of all programs and projects designed to serve the poor or low-income areas with the maximum feasible participation of residents of the areas and members of the groups served, so as to best stimulate and take full advantage of capabilities for self-advancement and assure that those programs and projects are otherwise meaningful to and widely utilized by their intended beneficiaries; and
"(5) the broadening of the resource base of programs directed to the elimination of poverty, so as to secure, in addition to the services and assistance of public officials, private religious, charitable, and neighborhood organizations, and individual citizens, a more active role for business, labor, and professional groups able to provide employment opportunities or otherwise influence the quantity and quality of services of concern to the poor. " ( b ) I t is further declared to be the purpose of this title and the policy of the Office of Economic Opportunity to provide for basic education, health care, vocational training, and employment opportunities in rural America to enable the poor living in rural areas to remain in such areas and become self-sufficient therein.

' 1) to secure and retain meaningful employment; ^2) to attain an adequate education;
" (3) to make better use of available income; "(4) to provide and maintain ad"equate housing and a suitable living environment; "(5) to undertake family planning, consistent with personal and family goals, religious and moral convictions; "(6) to obtain services for the prevention of narcotics addiction, alcoholism, and the rehabilitation of narcotic addicts and alcoholics; "(7) to obtain emergency assistance through loans or grants to meet immediate and urgent individual and family needs, including the need for health services, nutritious food, housing, and employment-related assistance; "(8) to remove obstacles and solve personal and family problems which block the achievement of self-sufficiency; "(9) to achieve greater participation in the affairs of the community; and "(10) to make more frequent and effective use of other programs related to the purposes of this title.

"(b) If the Director determines that a limited purpose project or program involving activities otherwise eligible under this section is needed to serve needs of low-income families and individuals in a community and no community action agency has been designated for that community pursuant to section 210, or where a community action agency gives its approval for such a program to be funded directly through a public or private nonprofit agency or organization, he may extend financial assistance for that project or program to a public or private nonprofit agency which he finds is capable of carrying out the project in an efficient and effective manner consistent with the purpose of this title. "(c) The Director shall prescribe necessary rules or regulations governing applications for assistance under this section to assure that every reasonable effort is made by each applicant to secure the views of local public officials and agencies in the community having a direct or substantial interest in the application and to resolve all issues of cooperation and possible duplication prior to its submission. " ( d ) After July 1,1968, the Director shall require, as a condition of assistance, that each community action agency has adopted a systematic approach to the achievement of the purposes of this title and to the utilization of funds provided under this part. Such systematic approach shall encompass a planning and implementation process which seeks to identify the problems and causes of poverty in the community, seeks to mobilize and coordinate relevant public and private resources, establishes program priorities, links program components with one another and with other relevant programs, and provides for evaluation. The Director may, however, extend the time for such requirement to take into account the length of time a program has been in operation. He shall also take necessary steps to assure the participation of other Federal agencies in support of the development and implementation of plans under this subsection. "(e) In order to promote local responsibility and initiative, the Director shall not establish binding national priorities on funds authorized by this section, but he shall review each application for

The provisions of this title applicable to the Interstate System shall apply to all mileage designated under the third sentence of this paragraph, except that the cost to the United States of the aggregate of all mileage designated under the third sentence of this paragraph shall not exceed the cost to the United States of the aggregate of all mileage approval for which is withdrawn under the second sentence of this paragraph, as such cost is included in the 1965 Interstate System cost estimate set forth in House Document Numbered 42, Eightyninth Congress. In considering routes or portions thereof to be added to the Interstate System under the third sentence of this paragraph, the Secretary shall, in consultation with the States and local governments concerned, give due regard to (A) routes or portions thereof in States in which the Secretary has heretofore or hereafter withdrawn
his approval of other routes or portions thereof, and (B) the extension of routes which terminate within municipalities served by a single interstate route, so as to provide traffic service entirely through such municipalities."

" (A) an amount representing the amount required by State law or regulation to be set aside in a reserve for mortgage guaranty insurance losses resulting from adverse economic cycles; and

For purposes of this paragraph, the amount required by State law or regulation to be so set aside in any taxable year shall not exceed 50 percent of premiums earned on insurance contracts (as defined in subsection (b) (4)) with respect to mortgage guaranty insurance for such year. For purposes of this subsection, all amounts shall be taken into account on a first-in-time basis.

Proclamation 3753

AMERICAN EDUCATION WEEK, 1966 By the President of the United States of America

October 26, 1966

A Proclamation

America's laws, her institutions, her wealth--all the treasures of our civilization--have been shaped not only by American will and ambition, but by American intellect.

Without the creative spark of human imagination; without trained minds and finely-trained men, none of our proudest accomplishments would have been possible.

And what is true of our past is even more true for our future: better education must be the base on which we build all our other goals.

Because we treasure trained intelligence as a precious national resource, we have begun a major effort to expand and improve our schools, colleges and universities.

A greatly-strengthened Federal, State and local partnership is at work to serve our 56 million students---the three of every ten Americans who are enrolled in school.

For their sake and for the nation's sake,

--We are making improved education available to thousands of poor children, so that they need not be poor adults;

--We are increasing opportunities for vocational training to meet changing job needs in a technical age;

--We are helping physically and socially handicapped young people prepare for productive lives;

--^We are cooperating with the States and with private institutions to improve higher education, and to make it more widely available to deserving young citizens.

But even these massive efforts are not enough.

No programs of government, on any level, hold more promise for the future of our nation than those which advance the cause of education. The foremost goal of this Administration has been to create a legacy of educational excellence. We shall continue to pursue that goal until our schools and universities are as great as human wisdom can make them, and the doors to our classrooms are open to every American boy and girl.

I call upon all the people of the United States to take an active part in the progress and improvement of American education. I ask the citizens of every community to seek every means of advancing the excellence of their schools and fulfilling the educational needs of their school children.

PEARL HARBOR DAY
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
"These are the times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country; but he that stands it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.'"
These words of Thomas Paine were read to Washington's Army when it was retreating across New Jersey, having tasted nothing but defeat. President Franklin D. Roosevelt also read these words to the American people several months after the unprovoked, unforeseen onslaught at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.
Today we are once again called upon to stand in the cause of freedom and justice. Again we reflect upon those words of Thomas Paine, and upon the steadfast heroism of our Armed Forces--which on that day in 1941 kindled in the hearts of all Americans a bright light of courage rallying them to supreme effort and sacrifice, and sustaining them throughout the terrible, long ordeal until final victory.
December 7, 1966, will mark the twenty-fifth anniversary of that attack on Pearl Harbor, and the Congress by Act of J u l y 9, 1964, has requested the President to issue a proclamation designating December 7,1966, as Pearl Harbor Day.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I , L Y N D O N B . J O H N S O N , President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim December 7,1966, as Pearl Harbor Day in commemoration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor,

WRIGHT BROTHERS DAY, 1966

By the President of the United States of America

December i, igee

A Proclamation

On December IT, 1903, two American brothers, Orville and Wilbur Wright, established a milestone in the history of man.

On that day, in a plane they had invented and constructed, they made the world's first successful flight in a heavier-than-air, power-driven machine.

That momentous flight over the sand dunes of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, lasted a mere twelve seconds.

B u t it marked the beginning of the age of aviation.

I t opened the way for a new industry which has expanded our domestic economy--for a new field of international trade and commerce--and for a world-wide network of communications which has helped to break down the barriers of intolerance and contributed to international understanding.

I t led this Nation to a preeminence in global transportation which is still unequaled, and which has contributed to strengthening both our defense and our economy.

I n commemoration of the achievements of Orville and Wilbur Wright, the Congress by a joint resolution approved December 17,1963 (77 Stat. 402), has designated the seventeenth day of December of each year as Wright Brothers Day and has requested the President to issue annually a proclamation inviting the people of the United States to observe that day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.

Proclamation 3758

BILL OF RIGHTS DAY--HUMAN RIGHTS DAY--HUMAN RIGHTS WEEK

December 5, 1966

gy the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

One hundred and seventy-five years ago, on December 15, 1791, our Bill of Rights--the first ten amendments of the United States Constitution--became effective. The Bill of Rights guarantees to every American the rights which are the foundation of democracy-- freedom of speech and religion, the right to peaceable assembly and petition, and the right to fair trial and protection against cruel and unusual punishments. The Bill of Rights thus affirms the words of the Declaration of Independence:

--That all men are created equal,

--That they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights,

--That among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,

--That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, and

--That governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed.

Any denial of these rights diminishes our stature as a nation. Yet, for too many, the ideals of freedom, justice, and equality are words only, with no real place or meaning in their daily lives.

Our successes in the struggle for human rights must not content us. Let them, rather, encourage us to move forward in this noblest of work of man. I t must never be said that injustice and inequality lived on in this era of unparalleled opportunity with our permission or our encouragement.

On December 10, 1948 the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as a standard for all people and all nations. It recognizes that equal and inalienable rights for all mankind are essential to freedom, justice, and peace in the world. It calls for an international order in which these rights and freedoms can be fully realized.

81 STAT. ]

PROCLAMATION 3759-DEC. 28, 1966

We must oppose any force--whether at home or abroad--which would deny these rights or take them away by threats or violence. We can take no other course. This is our heritage and our choice.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, L Y N D O N B. J O H N S O N , President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim December 10, 1966, as Human Rights Day and December 15, 1966, as Bill of Rights Day, and call upon the people of the United States to observe the week of December 10-17 as Human Rights Week, with appropriate ceremonies and activities.

Proclamation 3759

YOUTH FOR NATURAL BEAUTY AND CONSERVATION YEAR

By the President of the United States of America

December 28, 1966

A Proclamation

Last June, young men and women of the National Youth Conference on Natural Beauty and Conservation met in Washington and dedicated themselves:

--to work toward creating a healthful environment in our cities and towns.

--to speak out for the appreciation and protection of the beautiful.

--to clean, to plant, to plan and build for beauty.

--to plead with others to join them in that effort.

They made this pledge because their generation will soon inherit an America that threatens to become physically ugly.

The great industrial progress we have made in this century--resulting in an unj)aralleled prosperity for most of our people--has not been achieved without waste and blight. That progress grows with each year--and refuse, pollution and decay grow with it.

I t is no part of America's dream that we should erect a house of material well-being in the cheerless atmosphere of physical blight. Our people will be denied their heritage if they must live out their lives among polluted rivers, spoiled fields and forests, and streets where nothing pleases the eye.

Young people sense this strongly. They have not grown accustomed to ugliness. They have not resigned themselves to living among the litter and neglect of a careless civilization.

May they never do so.
But it is not enough to be offended by ugliness. Those who would not live without beauty must join in a tireless effort to bring it into being. They must help to reverse the sorry decline of cities and countryside. Tney must become a force for restoring order and dignity to the environment that surrounds them, I know that ugliness will yield to such a force, if it is supported by millions of our people, in public and private life.
And, T H E K E F O K E , I , L Y N D O N B. J O H N S O N , President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the year 1967 to be Youth for Natural Beauty and Conservation Year; and I ask our young people--individually and through clubs, school groups, and other organizations--to observe, to plan, and to act to preserve and protect, salvage and restore, develop and enhance their surroundings.
I ask the youth organizations which sponsored the National Youth Conference--and all other organizations and individuals working with youth--to expand the natural beauty and conservation activities now under way, and to begin new activities. I expect them to report their accomplishments to me during the year and also their plans for the future.
I call upon the President's Council on Recreation and Natural Beauty, the Citizen's Advisory Committee on Recreation and Natural Beauty, and all Federal officials and agencies to cooperate, consistent with their authorities and available funds, in providing technical assistance and support to the young people. It is an investment in better environment, and in better citizenship.
I further call upon all citizens to be alert to the activities and hopes of our young people, to hear their requests, to encourage and assist them, and with them to grow more aware of the beauty of America and the ways in which we can preserve it.

Law or Government alone could never bind two hundred million Americans together in common citizenship: this can only be the result of shared dreams, of common convictions, of the sense of kinship and fraternity which comes from a deep appreciation of our people's history.

Nor is that history merely a chronicle of battles won or lost: it is the sum of all our art and science, our philosophy and politics, our religion and our law. I t is all these woven together which make up the fabric of American life as we see it and live it today.

Finally, it is through the study of history that present generations can best honor our debt to the wisdom, faith, and sacrifice of those who came before us.

I n recognition of this, the Congress by a joint resolution approved November 5,1966, has designated February 1967 as American History Month and has requested the President to issue a proclamation inviting the people of the United States to observe that month with appropriate ceremonies. I am proud to honor that request.

5. W H E R E A S , consistent with the proclamations of January 9 and May 7, 1936, Subpart E of P a r t 2 of Schedule 7 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States renders the concessions reducing rates of duty with respect to the watch movements identified in the first recital of this proclamation inapplicable to any bushing-type movement, but, inconsistent with Proclamation No. 3062, Section 102(2) of the Tariff Classification Act of 1962, and Headnote 1 to Subpart A of P a r t 2 of the Appendix to the Tariff Schedules of the United States, and as a result of a clerical error.

Proclamation 3763
AMERICAN HEART MONTH, 1967
By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation
Disease of the heart and blood vessels continues to be the nation's number one killer. Last year it took almost one million American lives.
Heart disease also leaves a fearful toll in physical disability, suffering, blighted lives, and economic waste. The National Health Survey indicates that over 27 million Americans--more than one tenth of our total population--may suffer some form of heart disease.
Nonetheless, the outlook is encouraging. Public and private programs, such as those of the National Heart Institute of the Public Health Service and of the American Heart Association, are yielding substantial progress.
Greatly expanded research has opened new approaches to treatment and prevention, and the prospect for further advances is good. The results of research are helping more and more victims of heart ailments through improved resources and facilities, training and education, and community services.
Untimely death, disability and suffering due to heart disease can all be substantially reduced. How fast we move ahead will depend directly on the extent of public and private interest in and support of the necessary corrective measures.

Proclamation 3764
NATIONAL SAFE BOATING WEEK, 1967
By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation
Pleasure boating has become one of America's favorite pastimes. Last year, more than 40 million Americans took to the water in more than eight million pleasure boats. They also added nearly $3 billion to our economy.
This growing use of our waters must be accompanied by a greater awareness of safety. F o r the more boats in use, the greater the potential hazard. If we are to insure the full enjoyment of boating, and to avoid needless injury, loss of life, and destruction of property, we must pay increased attention to the basic principles of boating safety.
Boating organizations, the boating industry, and Federal and State agencies must share responsibility for promoting boating safety by informing the public of safety regulations and recommended safety practices. Only through such concerted community effort can boating be made one of our safest recreational sports, as well as one of the most popular.
To focus national attention on the importance of boating safety, the Congress by a joint resolution approved June 4, 1958 (72 Stat. 179), has requested the President to proclaim annually the week which includes July 4 as National Safe Boating Week:

A Proclamation

America's transportation network is a living testament to our system of free enterprise.

Operating in partnership with the Federal Government, it has met every challenge of w^ar and peace. I t has earned the respect and excited the admiration of men everywhere.

Yet the decades ahead will tax our ingenuity to meet sharply rising demands for transportation services. Transportation facilities must double every 20 years.

Responding to this challenge, the Congress has created a new Department of Transportation. I t s mission is to help the transportation industry develop new techniques and better integration of services. The new Department, now in its infancy, can help to assure the Nation the best, the most economical, and the fastest transportation services the world has ever seen.

I n recognition of the contributions of this great industry, the Congress, by joint resolution approved May 16, 1957 (71 Stat. 30), has requested the President to proclaim annually the third Friday of May of each year as National Defense Transportation Day, and by a joint resolution approved May 14, 1962 (76 Stat. 69), has requested the

Americans enjoy one of the highest standards of health and medical care in the world.
i\.mong children, disease has been steadily reduced by technological advances such as vaccines, antibiotics, and other medications. Among the elderly, other discoveries have helped to alleviate pain and suffering from chronic diseases.
The products of technology have lightened household chores and provided more time for leisure. But with this progress has come increased danger of poisoning in the home because of the wide use of such toxic substances as polishes, cleaners, solvents, pesticides, and medicines.
Most victims of poisoning in the home are young children. They need our protection--protection that we can provide only by using dangerous products with caution and taking the time and trouble to store them completely beyond the reach of children.

Proclamation 3768
NATIONAL FARM SAFETY WEEK, 1967
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Agriculture remains America's first and most important industry. It supplies food for our people and for many millions throughout the world, and a vast measure of the raw materials used in the making of other products.
Therefore, whatever diminishes or impedes the efficiency and productivity of our farmers is detrimental to men and women everywhere. Each year, accidents kill thousands of farm people, and disable nearly three-quarters of a million more. The resultant economic loss that must be borne by farm families and the Nation approaches two billion dollars.
This waste of human and economic resources, along with the tragic physical and psychological damage suffered by farm men, women, and children, should prompt us to regard the rural accident problem a matter for national concern.
For this reason, I urge all farm families to help make their farms and communities safer by eliminating hazards and discontinuing unsafe practices that cause or contribute to accidents. This is the objective of National Farm Safety Week, 1967.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I , LYNDON B . J O H N S O N , President of the United States of America, do hereby call on the people of the

Proclamation 3769
SAVE YOUR VISION WEEK, 1967
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
More than one million Americans cannot read a newspaper, not because they are illiterate, but because they cannot see well enough-- even with glasses.
One of every fifty Americans is blind or has only partial vision.
Every fourth schoolchild requires eye care. Every third serviceman needs glasses.
Americans fear blindness more than any affliction except cancer. And every year 32,000 Americans go blind. Aid to the blind costs $1 billion a year, aside from the economic loss suffered by those who must try to find their way through lives of perpetual darkness.
Yet there is hope. Blindness can be prevented. Research and better means of applying the knowledge of the laboratories to the lives of our people can materially lessen the scourge of blindness.
Every American should cherish his God-given gift of sight, protect and care for his eyes, and support the research, diagnosis, and treatment that can save vision.
I call upon all media of communications to carry a new message of hope to the blind. I call upon doctors, and private and public agencies, to press on with their work of saving, for us and for our children, the incomparable blessing of sight.
To encourage greater awareness and action, the Congress by a joint rcsolutiou approved December 30, 1963 (77 Stat. 629), requested the President to issue annually a proclamation designating the first week in March of each year as Save Your Vision Week:

Proclamation 3770
LAW DAY, U.S.A., 1967
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
May 1st is the tenth anniversary of Law Day, U.S.A. The theme of Law Day, 1967 is, in the words of Theodore Roosevelt: "No man is above the law and no man is below it."
Again we remind ourselves that law, and respect for law, is central to the idea of American democracy. Free government could not exist, said Justice Taney, without ready obedience to the law.
Thus all who cherish freedom should also cherish law. Liberty and law abide together. I n that bond is the foundation of our liberties.
I ask every American to take the law into his heart--not into his hands. I ask not blind obedience, but enlightened obedience. I ask patience too, for the law, like our times, will and must change. But America's fidelity to law must be eternal.
I ask every American to respect the law, and to respect also the men who are pledged to its enforcement. And of those who wear the badge, I ask an equal respect both for the law and for the rights of the people they are sworn to protect.
As your President, I can ask no less than the young lawyer Lincoln in 1838:
"Let every American, every lover of liberty . . . . remember that to violate the law is to trample on the blood of his father, and to tear the charter of his own and his children's liberty.
"Let reverence for the laws . . . . be taught in schools, in seminaries, and in colleges; let it be written in primers, spelling books, and in almanacs; let it be preached from the pulpit, proclaimed in legislative halls, and enforced in courts of justice . . . .

Proclamation 3771
WORLD TRADE WEEK, 1967
gy j ^ g President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
World trade joins the United States with other nations in a creative partnership that supports the growth of our free enterprise economy and advances the well-being of all our citizens.
Last year, total trade among the non-communist countries amounted to about $180 billion. Since 1960, this trade has grown by more than $67 billion, or an annual rate of more than 8 percent. Trade among the nations of the free world should reach the astounding annual rate of $200 billion in the year ahead.
The exchange of goods and services builds a foundation for mutual trust among nations. I t sustains our hopes for the attainment of a better world, in which all peoples may live in peace.
Expanding trade with nations around the world accelerates the pace of economic progress at home and abroad.

--It enlarges the opportunities for United States businessmen to sell more products and services in world markets. Since 1960, U.S. exports of merchandise have risen by 50 percent. I n 1966, they exceeded $29 billion, close to $3 billion more than the year before.
--It provides employment for more American workers. About three and a half million Americans are engaged, directly or indirectly, in the production, transport and marketing of our exports. The growth of this trade will create jobs for many more workers in both rural and urban areas throughout the United States.
--It widens the range of materials and consumer goods available at competitive prices in the domestic marketplace.
--It helps the developing countries make fuller use of their energies and resources.
--It encourages the international exchange of ideas, knowledge, and experience.
Vigorous expansion of our export volume is essential. We have succeeded in reducing the deficit in our balance of payments, but we must make still further improvement.
The United States will continue to support the reciprocal reduction of trade barriers to stimulate the flow of international commerce. To this purpose, an early and successful completion of the Kennedy Round of trade negotiations is especially important. There are only a few weeks remaining; by April 30, major issues must be settled and a balance of concessions achieved. The final agreement must be signed by June 30. An historic opportunity to broaden vastly the world's trade horizons is within reach. This opportunity must not be lost.
We are negotiating with other nations on the improvement of the international monetary system. International agreement that will assure an adequate growth of world reserves is a key to the future expansion of world trade.
We believe that trade also offers a means of achieving fruitful cooperation with the Soviet Union and other Eastern European nations. I n 1966, U.S. exports to Eastern Europe totalled only $200 million while other non-communist countries sold Eastern Europe goods worth over $6 billion. U.S. ratification of a consular agreement with the U.S.S.R., our various trade missions to Eastern Europe, and our participation in the 1967 food processing fair in Moscow illustrate our effort to build bridges through trade. We must continue to pursue lasting peace by seeking out every possible course to healthy economic and cultural relations with these countries.
The principal objective of our foreign trade policy is to promote the increase of peaceful, profitable commerce among our Nation and others.
World Trade Week reaffirms and supports this objective.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, LYNDON B. J O H N S O N , President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning May 21, 1967, as World Trade Week; and I request the appropriate Federal, State, and local officials to cooperate in the observance of that week.
I also urge business, labor, agricultural, educational, professional, and civic groups, as well as the people of the United States generally, to observe World Trade Week with gatherings, discussions, exhibits, ceremonies, and other appropriate activities designed to promote continuing awareness of the importance of world trade to our economy and our relations with other nations.

Proclamation 3772
YOUTH TEMPERANCE EDUCATION WEEK
gy j ^ ^ President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
The future of this nation, and perhaps of the world, rests on the integrity and commitment of young Americans who make u p almost half of our population. If we neglect the formation of their character, we betray a human trust that transcends the interest of any individual.
Out of a false sophistication, some find it embarrassing to speak of the simple virtues of character that are the mainstays of any great nation or civilization--of duty, sacrifice, fidelity, of sound minds in healthy bodies, of a sense of human brotherhood, love of country, sanctity of the home, purity of ideals.
Yet on these virtues the peace, prosperity, and quality of our society depend.
The condition of our nation today is historically unique. Never has any society come so close to defeating the ancient enemies of poverty, ignorance and ill health. Our social problems loom large in our consciousness, but in the perspective of history, ours is an unprecedented affluence--both in its extent and in its distribution. And that affluence represents both opportunity and temptation. If it lulls us into complacency, if it dims our moral perception, if it tranquilizes our concern for the suffering of the less fortunate, if it encourages self-indulgence and moral indolence, then it is no blessing but a curse.
If oiir children are to be enriched and not despoiled by the abundance of our material life, we must search our own hearts and minds, our own values and priorities, to be sure that moral and spiritual qualities are not submerged or blunted in the selfish quest for personal security, comfort and luxury. We must accept material abundance gratefully, as a condition which liberates our spirits and frees our minds for the great and beneficent conquests of human sorrow, suffering and weakness.
Human experience illustrates that liberty and discipline are not in opposition; that, in fact, liberty finds its roots in discipline. F o r the wider goals, the larger dreams, the nobler hopes belong to those who have learned to discipline their impulses and desires, to direct them toward the constructive purpose and the creative challenge.

During this week, set aside as Youth Temperance Education Week, let us consider ho^Y we may help our youngsters develop the moral and spiritual strength proudly to accept the challenge to build a better future for all mankind.
To alert young people to the dangers of intemperance and to assist them in the development of moral strength, physical fitness, and civic responsibility, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 4, 1966, has requested the President to issue a proclamation designating the week beginning April 23, 1967, as Youth Temperance Education Week.
To this end:
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I , L Y N D O N B.

Proclamation 3773
SENIOR CITIZENS MONTH, 1967
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Our society has made a commitment to enrich and improve the lives of the senior citizens among us.
A great part of that commitment to the 19 million Americans who are 65 or over has been advanced during this Administration.
Through Medicare, the often crushing burden of hospital and doctor bills has been eased.
The Older Americans Act, with its emphasis on community services, gives direction and meaning to lives that might have been spent out in frustration and purposelessness.
Other programs provide assistance to senior citizens in housing and nursing care, public welfare, and special training programs.
Recommendations now before the Congress will make the older years of life even more productive and more comfortable by:
--Increasing the benefits under Social Security;

March 3o,i967

1090

PROCLAMATION 3773-MAR. 30, 1967

[81 STAT.

--Raising the level of public assistance for those who must depend on such welfare for the essentials;
--Extending the benefits of Medicare to more people, and expanding its services;
--Increasing the educational, recreational and health services under the Older Americans Act;
--Eliminating income tax discrimination against those over 65 who continue to work;
--Prohibiting discrimination because of age in employment.
The Nation needs these programs in order to move closer to realizing the goals which we have set out as the objectives in our Bill of Rights for Older Americans--an adequate income, a decent home, and a meaningful retirement.
But to make good fully on its commitment, the Nation needs more than legislation. There must be an awareness in the heart of every citizen of the duty we all share in this abundant land to the elders whose lives have contributed to the development of the society we enjoy.
There must be a general awareness that it is within the power of us all to discharge that duty--to bring light to the lives of those who are lonely or in despair, better care to those who are ill or disabled, greater benefits to those who are impoverished.
The greater this awareness is, the greater will be our hope of bringing to all older Americans the opportunity to live full and rewarding lives in communities throughout the Nation.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, L Y N D O N B. J O H N S O N , President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the month of May 1967 as Senior Citizens Month.
I call upon all Federal, State and local governments, in partnership with private and voluntary organizations, to join in community effort to give meaning to the theme of tliis special month: M E E T I N G T H E CHALLENGE OF THE LATER YEARS.
Let each citizen help, in whatever way he can, to make this month memorable by working to provide within each community those benefits and opportunities Avhich will add satisfaction and dignity to the ] ives of older Americans.
I also invite the Governors of the States, the Governor of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Commissioners of the District of Columbia, and appropriate officials in other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to join in the observance of Senior Citizens Month.

Proclamation 3774
PAN AMERICAN DAY AND PAN AMERICAN WEEK, 1967
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
There is special meaning this year in the hemispheric tradition of Pan American Day.
On April twelfth, for the first time in a decade and the second time in history, the Presidents and Heads of Government of the American nations will meet to fortify the foundation of the house of the Americas.
Seventy-seven years ago we first joined our hearts and hands as brothers in a hopeful hemisphere. We pledged a common pledge-- we dreamed a common dream. We have since translated that pledge into progress. And we have founded the Organization of American States as a firm framework for the fulfillment of that dream.
We have recently strengthened that Organization by amending its Charter to meet the challenge that our changing times demand.
We have extended our unique experiment in international living by welcoming into our membership the new nation of Trinidad and Tobago.
We have enhanced the meaning of that experiment by forging within it an Alliance for Progress in which our goals for the good life are matched only by our desire to achieve them. And the impressive accomplishments of these last six years trace that desire's growing satisfaction.
When the Alliance was formed in 1961, it was estimated that our Latin American neighbors could supply about 80% of the capital required. I n fact, they have done better than this. By the end of this year, the gross investment in Latin America will have totaled over $100 billion--and 95% of it will have been from domestic sources. This ability of our neighbors to save and invest in their own future is a most striking indication that Latin America can, with relatively modest external help, mobilize the resources needed for its own development--and thus strengthen the foundations of the house we share in this hemisphere.
The cooperative spirit of the Alliance is bringing new-found confidence and hope into this house.
--Per capita growth rates show that more and more countries are breaking the economic stagnation of earlier years.
--Men, women and children are alive today who would otherwise have died. In ten countries, deaths caused by malaria dropped from 10,810 to 2,280 in three years' time. Smallpox cases declined almost as sharply. And new health centers and hospitals are growing everywhere.
--Men whose fathers for generations toiled on land owned by others are now working it as their own. With U.S. assistance, 1.1 million acres have been irrigated and 106,000 acres reclaimed. 15,000 miles of road have been built or improved, many of them farm-to-market access roads.
--For tens of thousands of families, the most fundamental conditions of life are improving. 350,000 housing units have been.

or are now being, constructed. New and modernized water supply systems have been built to benefit some 20 million people.
So as we assemble under the banner of the Alliance for Progress, we are cheered by success and encouraged in the task that lies ahead.
With the confidence born of achievement, we know that we can prepare a better world for the new generation of Americans who will come after us.
We look to the 60% of Latin America's 245 million people who are now under the age of 25, and we know that the task of meeting their aspirations is great. But we also know that we have forged the tools to do the task. And there is promise in what we see.
The sustaining arm of education is reaching out to more and more of this strategic 60% of Latin Americans.
--Since the Alliance was formed, school enrollments have increased at an average annual rate of over 6%. This rate represents more than twice the rate of increase in the total population.
--For each 1,000 inhabitants, there were 124 students enrolled in schools in 1960, 170 in 1965, and 174 in 1966.
--28,000 new classrooms have been built.
--160,000 teachers have been trained or given additional training.
--More than 14 million textbooks have been distributed.
--13 million school children and 3 million pre-schoolers participate in school lunch programs.
And more than this, what statistics cannot adequately relay is the emergence of a generation of vigorous, confident and responsible leaders throughout Latin America--leaders who are ready to help their countries help themselves. These leaders are beginning to include more and more women doers in their ranks. And since women comprise over half the population of Latin America, there is new potential in this leadership.
The successes scored by the Alliance have been aided by the United States--but they have been realized by the cooperative spirit that resides in the commitment and dedication of the Latin American nations themselves. Their unrelenting perseverance has been a keystone in the firm foundation of our house of hemispheric progress.
So as together we seek to strengthen--w^e seek a realistic goal.
As together we build to better--we build on solid ground.
Bound by geography, born of a common revolutionary heritage, nurtured by common ideals, committed to the dignity of man, and sustained by the youth and vigor that have been our common strength, we will project our traditions into a promising future--and we will prevail.
NOW, T H E R E F O K E , I, L Y N D O N B . J O H N S O N , President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Friday, April 14, 1967, as Pan American Day, and the week beginning April 9 and ending April 15 as P a n American Week; and I call upon the Governors of the fifty States of the Union, the Governor of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the officials of all other areas under the flag of the United States to issue similar proclamations.

Proclamation 3775
LOYALTY DAY, 1967
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
May 1st, in some parts of the world, is marked by demonstrations in support of totalitarian party dictatorships. Since 1959, we in the United States have celebrated it as "Loyalty Day," a time when we are asked to recall the ideals which have nourished our free society.
The contrast between these two types of celebration is striking. We are not demanding unthinking fealty to a party or a doctrine. On the contrary, allegiance to American ideals demands commitment to a ceaseless search for new routes to freedom, justice and equality.
Our flag then is not just a symbol of our nationhood. I t signifies more:
--A profound dedication to a community where the rights of minorities are respected as fully as the rights of the majority, where freedom and order are found in harmonious equilibrium.
The patriot leader John Adams thus felt obliged to defend the British officer accused of instigating the "Boston Massacre." And later noted in his diary that it was his proudest contribution to the tradition of freedom.
Similarly, Abraham Lincoln in 1838 called on "every American, every lover of liberty" to swear "never to violate the laws of the country" or to "tolerate their violation by others" through "mob law."
To an American, then, loyalty is not automatic acceptance of authority but consecration to the principles of a free society.
I t imposes restraints on the majority and on minorities alike. The majority must have the right to act, but its actions must follow the course of due process.
Minorities must retain the right to dissent, but should never confuse the right to be heard with the right to determine policy, should never

PROCLAMATION 3775-APR. 6, 1967

[81 STAT.

assert the undemocratic and arrogant claim to speak for the society as a whole.
I n 1967, Loyalty Day has a special meaning. F a r away in Vietnam, our young men are demonstrating by their bravery, and commitment to the freedom of others, the ultimate obligations loyalty can impose.
Loyalty Day 1967 thus becomes an opportunity for the vast majority in America--while respecting the right of dissent--to affirm their conviction that freedom is indivisible, their realization that the cruel burden of war must be carried, and their heartfelt gratitude to those who are risking their lives in harsh witness to our ideals.
If we are to be worthy of their sacrifice, it is vital that we demonstrate our active loyalty to the cause for which they fight. The badge of American loyalty should be more than a uniform.
Enlightened loyalty requires that each citizen take the trouble to learn about, to discuss, to think through, the crucial issues of our time.
Enlightened loyalty demands a commitment by the citizen to the daily life of his society. He must constantly strive to bring American practice into accord with American precepts.
Enlightened loyalty obligates every individual to act and speak in behalf of his beliefs, so the world will not mistake the clamor of dissenting activists for the true voice of the nation.
I n recognition of these precepts, the Congress by a joint resolution of July 18^ 1958 (72 Stat. 369), designated May 1 of each year as Loyalty Day and requested the President to issue a proclamation inviting the people of the United States to observe each such day with appropriate ceremonies.
NOW, T H E E E F O K E , I, L Y N D O N B. J O H N S O N , President of the United States of America, do call upon the people of the United States, and upon all patriotic, civic, and educational organizations, to observe Monday, May 1,1967, as Loyalty Day, with appropriate ceremonies in which all of us may join in a reaffirmation of our loyalty to the United States of America.
I ^Iso call upon appropriate officials of the Government to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on that day as a manifestation of our loyalty to the Nation which that flag symbolizes.
I N W I T N E S S W H E K E O F , I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.

Ours is an age of unprecedented progress in the field of medical research. Yet cancer continues to plague our people.
Every minute-and-three-quarters, a man, woman or child in America is struck by one of its many forms. I n this year alone, more than 300,000 Americans will die of it.
We have taken giant steps toward defeating it: today more people are being cured of cancer than ever before, and our understanding of its causes and characteristics is growing constantly.
But the incidence of cancer is still increasing more rapidly than our progress in curing it. We must intensify our research efforts, and we are:
--The National Cancer Institute of the United States Public Health Service, with a budget of more than $170 million this year, is striving to discover new facts about the causes and cures of cancer.
--Regional medical programs, under the Heart Disease, Cancer and Stroke Amendments of 1965, will bring the latest advances in diagnosis and treatment to people throughout the Nation.
--Medicare and other programs are helping to assure Americans of the care they need in the fight against cancer and other diseases.
-- I have recently directed the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to appoint a lung cancer task force, to supplement the work of task forces on leukemia, cancer chemotherapy, uterine cancer, solid tumor and breast cancer.
These efforts to combat cancer require the continuing cooperation of scientists, physicians, health agencies, and the public.
To impress upon our people the necessity for such cooperation, the Congress by a joint resolution of March 28, 1938 (52 Stat. 148), requested the President to issue annually a proclamation setting aside the month of April as Cancer Control Month.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I , L Y N D O N B.

In the United States today, more than three million children live as captives of asthma. I t affects two million adult Americans. Each year this disease takes 5,000 lives, and many thousands more suffer debilitating effects at home and on the job.
The asthma victim lives under the constant threat of attack by the disease. I t can come from his food, the air he breathes, even from emotional reactions to his environment. I n the throes of such an attack, he must have help.

STEELMARK MONTH
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Steel is the core of industrial America. I t has helped to make American productivity and technology the wonder of the world.
This vital product which we produce in unmatched abundance is basic to our economy and essential to our security. I t supports our buildings, spans our rivers, arms our fighting men.
I t is fundamental to thousands of products which are part of the everyday life of every citizen of this Nation.
It will be increasingly important to us in the years that lie ahead. Research continues to uncover new uses for this durable and versatile product to satisfy exacting military and civilian requirements.
Moreover, the steel industry makes its own vital contribution to the American economy with its demand for raw materials, equipment, and the services of other industries.
The steel industry has created a distinctive symbol for its products-- the "steelmark." I t is used to identify products made of steel and to increase public awareness of the importance of steel to our national life.
By a joint resolution approved November 2, 1966, the Congress designated the month of May of each year as Steelmark Month and requested the President to issue a proclamation for the observance of such a month.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, L Y N D O N B . J O H N S O N , President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon all the people of the United States to observe the month of May in this and each succeeding year as Steelmark Month with appropriate proceedings and ceremonies.

Proclamation 3780
DISCOVER AMERICA PLANNING WEEK
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
The discovery of America began many centuries ago, but it is not yet ended. I t is a continuing experience. Each year, more and more Americans--and friends from other lands--are discovering anew our Nation's bountiful store of natural and cultural treasure.
America is blessed with a wealth of scenic beauty of widely varied kinds. I t is rich in historical, cultural, educational, and technological attractions. It is abundant in recreational opportunities and facilities. Its people are hospitable.
As the summer of 1967 approaches, more travelers than ever before are preparing for that experience of discovery. I t is estimated that 140 million United States citizens will journey this year to some part of our broad and diverse Nation for pleasure. I n addition, some 9 million visitors from other lands will come here to share the enjoyments which our country offers.
This travel is good for America and its people. In economic terms, it will bring into circulation an estimated $26 billion. Even more important are the memorable contributions which travel makes to the health, happiness and mutual understanding of all people.
I t is appropriate that a period of time be set aside in which attention can be focused on the benefits which travel in the United States will bring to the Nation, its citizens and its visitors.
NOW, T H E R E E ' O E E , I, L Y N D O N B. J O H N S O N , President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the period of April 16-22, 1967, to be D I S C O V E R A M E R I C A P L A N N I N G W E E K throughout the Nation.
I n the interest of making 1967 a better travel year than ever for the United States, I urge all individuals, businesses, industries, and civic and other organizations to give the observance their fullest cooperation and support. This can be done by encouraging Americans and the

Proclamation 3781
RUSH-BAGOT AGREEMENT DAYS
gy j ^ g President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
The Rush-Bagot Agreement, signed on April 28-29, 1817, provided for naval disarmament between Canada and the United States along the Great Lakes and Lake Champlain.
It is the oldest arms limitation treaty existing in the world today. For that reason alone it deserves wide recognition.
The Rush-Bagot Agreement--expressed in an exchange of notes between Richard Rush, Acting Secretary of State, and Sir Charles Bagot, British Minister to the United States--was one of the most significant steps in the development of peaceful relations between the United States and Canada. The unfortified boundary between our two countries is a symbol to the rest of the world of the harmony and understanding which can be achieved by two sovereign governments.
The celebration of this event in the United States and Canada coincides with the opening of the 1967 Universal and International Exhibition--known as E X P O 67--in Montreal. The theme of the Exhibition, "Man and His World," has a close relationship to the spirit of peace and good will embodied in the Rush-Bagot Agreement.
I n recognition of the significance of this agreement signed 150 years ago, the Congress by a joint resolution approved April 27, 1967, has requested the President to issue a proclamation designating April 28-29, 1967, as Rush-Bagot Agreement Days.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I , L Y N D O N B. J O H N S O N , President of the United States of America, do hereby designate April 28-29, 1967, as Rush-Bagot Agreement Days; and I invite the Governors of the several States, the chief officials of local governments, and the people of the United States to observe these days with appropriate ceremonies and activities.

NATIONAL MARITIME DAY, 1967
By fhe President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Throughout American history, the Merchant Marine has been indispensable to our security and prosperity.
Today, our merchant fleet binds us in peaceful commerce with the increasingly interdependent nations of the world.
I n this decade alone, our imports and exports have risen nearly 60 percent--from less than $35 billion in 1960 to nearly $55 billion in 1966.
Merchant ships carry the essentials of life to millions in need. They transport military supplies and equipment to our forces abroad. Of all our supplies being sent to Vietnam today, 98 percent are carried by ship.
To remind Americans of the important role which the merchant marine plays in our national life, the Congress in 1933 designated the anniversary of the first transatlantic voyage by a steamship, the SS Savannah^ on May 22, 1819, as National Maritime Day, and requested the President to issue a proclamation annually in observance of that day.

May 9, i967 ^^ st^at. 73.

NOW, T H E E E F O E E , I, L Y N D O N B . J O H N S O N , President of the United States of America, do hereby urge the people of the United States to honor our American Merchant Marine on Monday, May 22, 1967, by displaying the flag of the United States at their homes and other suitable places, and I request that all ships sailing under the American flag dress ship on that day in tribute to the American Merchant Marine.

SMALL BUSINESS WEEK, 1967
By fhe President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Fully 95 percent of the businesses serving the needs of the American people are small and privately owned. More than a third of the Nation's total goods and services are supplied by small businesses.
Small businesses perform a service to the Nation beyond the supplying of goods. Operating in an open, competitive market, they stimulate the new ideas that create progress. They provide community leadership to aid economic development. They offer a wide and challenging variety of job opportunities to our people.
To encourage the growth of new small businesses, the Small Business Administration has in the past three years granted 830 loans, totalling over $131 million, to local development companies. These loans have resulted in the creation of 28,800 new jobs, and added nearly $1.2 billion to our economy. During the last three years there has been a net increase of 200,000 in the number of small business establishments in our Nation.
We recognize and applaud the contributions made by our 4.8 million small businesses. We must insure that they will continue to hold a vital place in our society.
NOW, T H E R E F O E E , I, L Y N D O N B . J O H N S O N , President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning May 21,1967, as Small Business Week, and I urge industrial and commercial organizations, chambers of commerce, boards of trade, and other public and private organizations to participate in ceremonies recognizing the significant contributions, past and present, of small business to our land, our culture, and our ideals.

Proclamation 3784
MOTHER'S DAY, 1967
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
With each passing generation, the words of the poet--"Children are what the mothers are'"--take on greater meaning. We become ever more aware that the quality of our s,ociety depends in large measure upon the training our children receive in the early years of their lives.
The American mother has borne the major responsibility for that early training.
The fortitude to brave the frontier, the courage to bear our flag in battle, the compassion to help the needy and the weak at home and in distant lands--all of these have come to our people through traits of character instilled by our mothers.
I t is fitting that we should set aside one day each year to pay tribute to our mothers--to thank God for their loving devotion, their moral teaching, and their steadfastness in all the weathers of our souls.
To this end, the Congress more than fifty years ago designated the second Sunday in May of each year as Mother's Day and requested the President to issue a proclamation calling for its observance.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, L Y N D O N B . J O H N S O N , President of the United States of America, pursuant to the joint resolution of May 8,1914, do hereby request that Sunday, May 14,19G7, be observed as Mother's D a y ; and I direct the appropriate officials of the Government to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on that day.
I call upon all Americans on that day to pay special tribute to mothers--to our own mothers and to the mothers of our children-- through the display of the flag at their homes or other suitable places, through prayers, and through other acts of love and devotion.

PRAYER FOR PEACE, MEMORIAL DAY, 1967
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
I n reverent tribute on this Memorial Day 1967 we salute the gallant men of our country who have served us and still serve us so nobly and selflessly in defense of freedom.
We can never repay their sacrifices. Our honored dead sleep in hallowed ground on five continents. The debt we owe them, and that our children will owe for generations to come, is beyond measure.
Today, our young men are fighting and dying in Vietnam so that other young men may stand as they have stood--proudly independent, free to determine their own destiny. Before their common sacrifice and dedication the barriers of race, color, or creed crumble. The heroism of a just cause makes all men brothers against tyranny.
Every President in time of armed conflict must act in the deep conviction that the cause for which our young men suffer and die transcends their sacrifices.
A century ago President Lincoln expressed his grief over the terrible losses of the war between the States. He pointed out that all deprecated war, all sought to avoid it, but as there were those who would make war, so there must be those who could accept war.
We have had to accept the war in Vietnam to redeem our pledge to those who have accepted in good faith our commitment to protect their right of free choice. Only in this way can we preserve our own right to act in freedom.
So we shall continue to resist the aggressor in Vietnam, as we must.
But we continue to hold open the door to an honorable peace, as we must.

And I ask you, my fellow Americans, to join me in prayer that the voice of reason and humanity will be heeded, that this tragic struggle can soon be brought to an end.
The Congress in a joint resolution approved May 11, 1950 (64 Stat. 158), has requested the President to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to observe each Memorial Day as a day of prayer for permanent peace and designating a period during such day when the people of the United States might unite in such supplication:
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, L Y N D O N B. J O H N S O N , President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Memorial Day, Tuesday, May 30, 1967, as a day of prayer for permanent peace and I designate the hour beginning in each locality at eleven o'clock in the morning of that day as a time to unite in such prayer.
I urge the press, radio, television, and all other information media to cooperate in this observance.
I also urge all of the people of this Nation to join me in prayer to the Almighty for the safety of our Nation's sons and daughters around the world, for His blessing on those who have sacrificed their lives for this Nation in this and all other struggles, and for His aid in building a world where freedom and justice prevail, and where all men live in friendship, understanding, and peace.

CITIZENSHIP DAY AND CONSTITUTION WEEK, 1967

The signing of the United States Constitution on September 17,1787, gave this Nation an effective plan of self-government--designed to assure our people equality and justice under law, liberty, and unparalleled opportunity for all.
Today, one hundred and eighty years later, despite the increasing complexities of our world, the Constitution continues to guard fundamental rights.

[81 STAT.

The preservation of freedom, equality, and justice requires not only an intelligent exercise of our constitutional rights and privileges, but a firm recognition and support of the rights of others.
Our citizens should be ever mindful of the oppressive conditions and injustices which led to the drafting and signing of the Constitution, and of the sufferings and sacrifices which have made it a viable, effective charter of liberty down through the years. Against this background and in the spirit of the Founding Fathers, they must constantly renew and strengthen their devotion and adherence to constitutional precepts.
Our citizens--naturalized or native-born--must also seek to refresh and improve their knowledge of how our government operates under the Constitution and how they can participate in it. Only in this way can they assume the full responsibilities of citizenship and make our government more truly of, by, and for the people.
Aware of the need for a recurrent dedication of all our citizens to the principles and ideals of the Constitution, the Congress enacted the joint resolutions of February 29,1952 (66 Stat. 9), and August 2,1956 (70 Stat. 932). The first resolution designated September 17 of each year as Citizenship Day in commemoration of the formation and signing of the Constitution on September 17,1787, and in recognition of those persons who during the year acquired the status of citizenship either by coming of age or b^ naturalization. The later resolution requested the President to designate the week beginning September 17 of each year as Constitution Week.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, L Y N D O N B. J O H N S O N , President of the United States of America, summon the appropriate officials of the Government to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on Citizenship Day, September 17,1967; and I urge Federal, State and local officials, as well as all religious, civic, educational, and other organizations, to conduct meaningful ceremonies and observances on that day to inspire all our citizens, especially our youth in whose hands the future rests, to pledge themselves anew to the service of their country and to the support and defense of the Constitution.
I also designate the period beginning September 17 and ending September 23, 1967, as Constitution Week; and I urge the people of the United States to observe that week with appropriate ceremonies and activities in their schools and churches, and in other suitable places, to the end that our citizens, whether they be naturalized or naturalborn, may have a better understanding of the Constitution and of the rights and responsibilities of United States citizenship.

Proclamation 3787
WHITE CANE SAFETY DAY, 1967
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Independence--so important to every American--has a special significance to the blind. Although imprisoned in a world of unceasing darkness, the blind must still be able to enjoy freedom of movement.
The White Cane has become the emblem of the blind American's determination to live the most independent, constructive life possible. Since the foundation of the National Federation for the Blind in 1940, the White Cane has symbolized the aspirations and abilities of the blind. Available to every blind American, it is his passport to selfsufficiency.
But the blind can enjoy their freedom with confidence only if their fellow citizens learn to treat them with consideration and respect. Today, all 50 states have White Cane Laws, emphasizing that for the White Canes to spell independence to the blind they must also spell caution to the rest of us.
We must learn to recognize this symbol from afar, and to understand how much another person's freedom and life depend on our acknowledging his right-of-w^ay above our own.
To make our citizens more fully aware of the significance of the White Cane, and of the need for motorists to exercise caution and courtesy when approaching its bearer, the Congress, by a joint resolution, approved October 6, 1964 (78 Stat. 1003), has authorized the President to issue annually a proclamation designating October 15 as White Cane Safety Day.
NOW, T H E R E F O E E , I , L Y N D O N B. J O H N S O N , President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim October 15, 1967, as White Cane Safety Day.
I call upon all our citizens, our civic and service organizations, schools, public bodies and the media of public information in every community to join in observing White Cane Safety Day, so that blind persons in our society may increasingly enjoy the greatest possible measure of personal independence.

Proclamation 3788
FLAG DAY AND NATIONAL FLAG WEEK, 1967
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
On June 14, 1777, our young nation created a symbol of her newly declared freedom. That day, in Philadelphia, the Continental Congress resolved "That the flag of the thirteen United States be thirteen stripes, alternate red and white, that the union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing a new constellation."
Then, this flag was only colored cloth. B u t the beliefs and achievements of the people who pledged it allegiance quickly endowed our national banner with the proud meaning it has today.
This is the flag that gave words to our anthem, that beckoned generations of immigrants to our shores, that gave safe escort to our commerce, and protection to Americans abroad.
This is the flag that crossed the oceans in defense of freedom, that waved in the smoke above Corregidor, that was pushed aloft on Iwo Jima, that cheered the liberated peoples of Europe. This is the flag that has covered the remains of those who died in freedom's cause.
This flag has earned the salute of the soldier and the respect of our citizens.
So that this may be done, NOW, T H E E E F O K E , I, LYNDON B. J O H N S O N , President of the United States, do hereby designate the week beginning June 11, 1967, as National Flag Week.
I direct the appropriate Government officials to display the flag on all Government buildings during that week. And on Flag Day, June 14--the 190th anniversary of the action of the Continental Congress--I urge every American to fly the flag.
Fly it from your home, and from your place of business. And fly it in your heart. Let us teach our children of its meaning by our proud and reverent example. Let every American show how this "new constellation"--now of half a hundred stars--continues to guide and inspire the way of a free and dauntless people.

NATIONAL COAL WEEK

By the President of the United States of America

June is, i967

A Proclamation

Nearly a thousand years ago, Indians in what is now Arizona began to mine coal as a fuel for baking pottery. From that remote beginning grew a great industry that contributed mightily to our development as a Nation.

Coal fed the steam engines that conquered our rivers and pushed our frontiers westward. I t smelted the iron that built cities and railroads and automobiles. I t warmed our homes and provided the current to light them.

I t fired--and is still firing--the furnaces of freedom.

Today, our expanding technology imposes new demands on the coal industry to assure its future service as a source of energy, and as a continued source of livelihood for thousands of our citizens.

All Americans look to the leaders of this great industry--management and labor alike--to continue their efforts toward further technological advancement. I t is essential to our national well-being that this great natural resource, which has meant much to our history, continue to play a significant role in the development of America's tomorrow.

The Congress, by Senate Concurrent Eesolution 20, has asked me to direct attention to this abundant resource. I t is my pleasure to do so.

NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, L Y N D O N B . J O H N S O N , President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week of June 1824, 1967, as National Coal Week.

I invite the Governors of the various States to issue proclamations for this purpose. I encourage the various agencies and departments to join in suitable observances of National Coal Week, including public meetings, exhibits, and news-media features.

W H E K E A S , on the basis of such investigations and reports, I find and declare that the imposition of the import restrictions hereinafter proclaimed is necessary in order that the entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption of such articles will not render or tend to render ineffective, or materially interfere with the price support program now conducted by the Department of Agriculture for milk and butterfat;

Proclamation 3791
WORLD LAW DAY, 1967
By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation
Our Nation is committed to the Rule of Law. A government of laws, rather than of men, is the very essence of our society.
The Rule of Law, in our tradition, demands that

juiy 3, i967

1114

PROCLAMATION 3792-JULY 12, 1967

[81 STAT.

--Men be entitled to the government and the representatives of their choice.
--No citizen be above the law.
--Justice be administered by an independent judicial system.
--Disputes be fairly resolved by peaceful means.
We wish that relations among nations, as among individual citizens, were alwajs governed by the Kule of Law--that disputes among nations were always adjudicated peacefully--that nations could learn to live with their differences as law-abiding neighbors.
One step in making this vision a reality is the joining together of the best judicial and legal minds of many nations. Many men of such eminence will assemble in Geneva on July 10, 1967, for the World Conference of World Peace Through Law. While other meetings will command more headlines, none will meet for a more important purpose.
I t is especially fitting in these times of strife that we salute those who seek to establish the Rule of Law as a standard for the world.
Our best wishes are with this conference, as it assembles to promote the role of law and legal institutions in the resolution of international disputes and the maintenance of world peace. We join our fellow men throughout the world in reaffirming our commitment to the principles of international justice--and our hope that all men may find the wisdom to implement them.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, LYNDON B. JOHNSON, President of the United States of America, in order to advance the great goal of achieving and securing world peace, do hereby proclaim July 10,1967, as World Law Day, and I call upon all public and private officials, members of the legal profession, citizens, and all men of good will to demonstrate the importance of the law in mankind's quest for world peace by appropriate observances and ceremonies in courts, schools, universities, and other public places.
IN W I T N E S S W H E R E O F , I have hereunto set my hand this third day of July in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-first.

UNITED NATIONS DAY, 1967
By jhe President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Twenty-two years ago, the United States joined in founding the United Nations. Since that time, our Nation has faithfully honored its commitments to the world body, in pursuit of a just and lasting peace.
Every President and Congress since the time of Franklin Delano Roosevelt has given full support to the United Nations. Under every Administration, and without regard to party, our country has:
--cooperated actively in the United Nations search for peace in the Middle East, Kashmir, and other troubled areas around the world;
--supported the United Nations efforts to strengthen the respect of men and nations for the rule of law, and for fundamental human rights and freedoms;
--worked to limit armaments, including nuclear weapons, under effective international control;
--supported the principle of self-determination for areas emerging from dependent status;

81 STAT. 1

PROCLAMATION 3798-AUG. 2, 1967

1121

--contributed abundantly to United Nations humanitarian activities, and to its programs of economic and social development.
The successful negotiation of a treaty banning weapons of mass destruction from outer space is an outstanding recent example of our support for the UN's work.
The United Nations has no magic formula for solving the increasingly complex problems of our revolutionary age. I t s failures have disheartened those who saw in it the only hope for peace in a world torn by strife. Yet despite those failures, it has achieved much that could not have been achieved without it. I t remains the symbol, and the standard, of man's desire to turn away from ancient quarrels and make peace with his neighbor.
I urge Americans to study the United Nations--its accomplishments, its strengths, its limitations, and its potential for the future. Broad public knowledge of the United Nations can provide a firm base for future United States action in the organization.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I , LYNDON B. J O H N S O N , President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Tuesday, October 24, 1967, as United Nations Day, and urge the citizens of this Nation to observe that day by means of community programs that will contribute to a realistic understanding of the aims, problems, and achievements of the United Nations and its associated organizations.
I also call upon officials of the Federal and State Governments and upon local officials to encourage citizen groups and agencies of communication--press, radio, television, and motion pictures--to engage in special and appropriate observance of United Nations Day this ;7ear in cooperation with the United Nations Association of the United States of America and other interested organizations.

PROCLAMATION 3798
FIRE PREVENTION WEEK, 1967
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Every day, destructive fires bring tragedy and loss to some American families. Every year the human toll of fire exceeds 10,000 lives. I n 1966, more than twice as many Americans were killed by fire than on the battlefields of Vietnam.
The dollar damage from fire increases every year. Last year, almost $2 billion worth of property was destroyed in flame and smoke.
These are grievous statistics. They represent sorrow and suffering and financial hardship which need not have happened. F o r fire's final, bitter irony is that most of it is avoidable. Most fires are caused by carelessness or by hazardous conditions which could be corrected.
It is imperative that the United States undertake a massive program to perfect its knowledge of, and its protection against, the havoc of fire.

Ante, p. 568.

For this reason, I have asked the Congress to enact the Fire Kesearch and Safety Act of 1967, which will:
--Improve our information about the causes and costs of fire.
--Develop better fire fighting and fire prevention techniques.
--Support community efforts to improve their fire control programs.
--Expand public education in the prevention of fires.
I have also asked the Congress to enact amendments to the Flammable Fabrics Act, which will enable us to help save the thousands who die each year because of flammable and explosive clothing and interior furnishings.
This legislation will strengthen America's efforts to reduce the senseless repetition of destruction that fire inflicts on our Nation.
But in the final analysis, fire prevention can succeed only at the community level. Local efforts must make every citizen aware of his personal responsibility for removing fire hazards and reforming the habits that cause fires.
Recognizing the importance of those efforts, I , L Y N D O N B . J O H N S O N , President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning October 8, 1967, as Fire Prevention Week.
I bid all citizens earnestly to support the fire prevention and control efforts of their community fire departments. I urge State and local governments, the National Fire Protection Association, business and civic groups, and public information agencies to observe Fire Prevention Week, to provide useful fire safety information to the public, and to enlist the active participation of all citizens in year-round fire prevention programs. I also direct the Federal Fire Council and the appropriate Federal agencies to assist in this effort to reduce the needless waste of life and property caused by preventable fires.

The future of America is written on school blackboards and in student notebooks. The quality of thought in our classrooms today will determine the quality of our lives a generation hence.
This year more Americans are in school than ever before in our history. Three out of every ten are occupied--as students or teachers-- in the process of education.
Thirty-seven million children--1.4 percent more than last year-- are enrolled in elementary schools. High school enrollments are up 3

percent more than last year--to 13.7 million. College and university enrollments have increased 8.3 percent from last year--up to 6.5 million.
Dropout rates are falling. About three out of four young people finish high school today. The 1968 high school graduating class will be the largest in history, and about 40 percent of these graduates will go on to college. Every sixth young American is earning a bachelor's degree.
Our people know that the education of our young people is our best investment. In just two years, Federal contributions to education at all levels have nearly tripled. And we have not rested, and will not rest until we
--bring college within reach of every American,
--make vocational training available to all who need it,
--provide education and training for adults who missed it in their youth,
--improve the quality of education for all.
To call attention to this challenge, to muster the support of all the media of communication, public officials, business leaders, parents, educators and students, I , L Y N D O N B . J O H N S O N , President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the period of November 5 through November 11, 1967, as American Education Week, and I call upon the American people to celebrate the achievements of their educational system, and to dedicate themselves to making it still more responsive to our Nation's needs.

"STAY IN SCHOOL"
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Education through high school is now within the reach of every American boy and girl. I t is essential to our nation's welfare--and to theirs--that they grasp it.
This Nation could neither prosper nor endure without trained, productive men and women. F o r this reason, we have begun a massive campaign
--to extend the blessings of education to the children of the poor,
--to increase opportunities for vocational training,
--to help the physically handicapped,
--and to bring higher education within the grasp of more and more of our young people.
A high school diploma is not a sure pass to a successful life, but it vastly increases a young adult's chances for employment and economic independence.
Those who seek employment without training or preparation will knock upon many closed doors. This year, more than 900,000 of our youth will not return to their high school classrooms to complete their secondary education.
For their sake and for ours, it is urgent that they, and others who are tempted to leave school, be persuaded to continue their education.
Citizens in communities across the Nation can help to combat the high school dropout problem--and they are. We have succeeded in reducing the percentage of dropouts among high school age youngsters from 26 percent in 1960 to 18 percent last year. B u t we must do more.
To emphasize the importance of this task, I , L Y N D O N B. J O H N SON, President of the United States of America, do proclaim a national "Stay in School" campaign.

NATIONAL EMPLOY THE PHYSICALLY HANDICAPPED WEEK, 1967
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Millions of American families know, firsthand, the painful and frustrating limitations of physical disability.
Those handicaps, cruel as they are, need not be totally disabling. Our society should not be deprived of the skills and talents of disabled men and women. Many of those men and women have a remarkable capacity for achievement despite their disability.
I t is part of America's promise that every citizen should have the opportunity to escape from perpetual dependence, make the most of his capacities, and take a full part in community life.
Government and private organizations have long worked to reduce the consequences of disability. Research, health conservation programs, and medical and rehabilitation facilities have all combined to lessen the residual damage of disease and injury.
The Federal Government is assisting States and communities in training the handicapped for jobs in a continually changing job market. I t offers leadership to business and industry to increase the range of job opportunities for the handicapped. I t encourages voluntary organizations to create the necessary climate of acceptance for the full admission of the handicapped into the mainstream of everyday life.
Yet pockets of prejudice still exist, particularly against certain categories of the more severely disabled.
We must continue to educate our citizens--employers and workers, healthy and handicapped--about the benefits of developing and using every person's skills.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, LYNDON B. J O H N S O N , President of the United States of America, in consonance with the joint resolution of Congress approved August 11, 1945 (59 Stat. 530), designating the first full week of October of each year as National Employ the Physically Handicapped Week, do hereby call upon the people of our Nation to observe the week beginning October 1,1967, for such purpose.

Proclamation 3803

NATIONAL SCHOOL LUNCH WEEK, 1967

August 30, 1967

By fhe President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

This year nearly 20 million children--more than ever before--will be served low-cost or free lunches under the National School Lunch Program. More than 71,000 elementary and secondary schools take part in the program.

Now in its twenty-first year, the Program remains an effective example of how Federal, State and local agencies can work together for the health and well-being of the Nation's children.

Over the past several years we have invested more than $1 billion to bring school lunch and nutritional programs to the children of our cities.

The Program also makes good use of America's food abundance, helping to convert farm products into meals for children, many of whom might otherwise have gone hungry.

This year, in addition, about 100,000 children in selected schools will be served breakfast in school under a pilot program authorized by the Child Nutrition Act of 1966.

There are still 9 million children attending schools which have no school lunch program. That number includes one million poor children who should be receiving lunch at little or no cost. Thus, while deserved recognition is being given our progress, we cannot be wholly satisfied until these needy young people are also being assisted.

36 u s e 168.

I n recognition of the value and achievements of the School Lunch Program, the Congress by a joint resolution of October 9, 1962 (76 Stat. 779), has designated the seven-day period beginning on the second Sunday of October in each year as National School Lunch Week, and has requested the President to issue annually a proclamation calling for the observance of that week.

Proclamation 3804 NATIONAL HIGHWAY WEEK, 1967

By the President of the United States of America

September23, i967

A Proclamation

There are now more than 100 million motor vehicle operators in the United States. They drive their automobiles and trucks nearly a trillion miles a year--over a network of 3.7 million miles of streets and roads that is the envy of the world.
These are impressive statistics, but they fail to convey the real contribution America's highways make to the economic and social life of the country. The best way of understanding that contribution is by considering what we would do without the road and system we have.

Today we are entering a new era in highway transportation. The creation of the Department of Transportation, and under it the Federal Highway Administration, marked a broadening of the Federal interest in total highway transportation.

We are becoming more and more concerned with the operation of those highways. We have begun an unprecedented effort to make our highways and the vehicles that operate on them as safe as man can achieve. We are engaged in a parallel effort to beautify our highways and roadsides, and to provide rest and recreation facilities for highway travelers.

The continued growth of highway travel reflects the demand of Americans for a greater mobility that broadens their opportunities for residence, recreation, and employment. The rapid growth of trucking reflects the increasing economy and efficiency of highway transport.
In serving these private and economic needs, however, we must always remember that highways are for the whole society's convenience and enjoyment. We must take pains to assure that highway development proceeds with a due respect for the needs of all our people--that it becomes neither an end in itself, nor an isolated phenomenon, unrelated to the orderly use of land.

Our unmatched achievements in highway transportation have been accomplished through a partnership of Federal, State, and local governments--in the finest tradition of democratic government. Those achievements should be acknowledged and celebrated by those who benefit from them.

VETERANS DAY, 1967

September25,1967

gy jl,g President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Ante. p. 178.

We Americans hold freedom as our birthright. We cherish it as the basic condition of our national life.
But we are deeply mindful of its cost.
Our freedom was won in the agony of conflict. Two centuries later, we enjoy its blessings only because men have been willing to risk their lives to preserve it.
Again today, in a complex and bitter war, America's sons must fight in freedom's defense. None before them have fought more bravely, or with greater devotion to America's cause, than those who serve us now in Vietnam.
We can never repay in full the debt we owe to the veterans of this Nation's wars.
Yet we can show our appreciation of their service and sacrifice. Through the G.I. Bill of Rights, we endeavor to ease the serviceman's retum to civilian life. As a result of the Veterans' Act of 1967, men in uniform today can receive benefits comparable to those granted their brothers-in-arms of past conflicts.
For almost three decades, it has been a proud American tradition to observe each year a special day of gratitude to all of America's veterans.

To this end the Congress has designated the eleventh of November as a legal holiday to be known as Veterans Day, and has dedicated it to the cause of world peace (Act of May 13,1938, 52 Stat. 351, as amended (5U.S.C.6103)).

NOW, T H E E E F O K E , I, L Y N D O N B. J O H N S O N , President of the United States of America, urge the people of this Nation to join in commemorating Saturday, November 11, 1967, as Veterans Day with suitable observances.

Proclamation 3806

CHILD HEALTH DAY, 1967

By the President of the United States of America

September25, i967

A Proclamation

Fifty years ago almost a hundred babies in every thousand died in their first year. By 1965 this tragic figure had dropped to twentyfive. The result is that an inconsolable grief has been lifted from the hearts of millions of American families--and more than a third of our population today is under eighteen years of age.

The health of our children is both a national pride and a national concern.

Thanks to the genius of our medical scientists, doctors, and public health officials--who have in recent years received vital support from national funds--many of the diseases which plagued our childhood are no longer a serious threat to our children today.

Vaccines for polio, diphtheria, and whooping cough have cut these diseases to a virtual vanishing point. Measles, so familiar in our youth, can be dealt a final blow this fall if all the children in kindergarten and first and second grades, who are not already protected, are vaccinated. Other infectious diseases of childhood, such as scarlet fever, can be quickly controlled and their after-effects prevented with today's drugs.

It is important to the American future that we assure the health and full development of our youth. F o r to the degree that we do, we assure the health and development of tomorrow's America.

I urge all Americans to encourage our young people to take full advantage of the many facilities for the promotion and protection of physical, mental, and emotional health.

Because of its concern for the well-being of our children, the Congress, by a joint resolution of May 18, 1928, 45 Stat. 617, as amended (36 U.S.C. 143), requested the President of the United States to issue annually a proclamation setting apart the first Monday in October as Child Health Day.

GENERAL PULASKI'S MEMORIAL DAY, 1967

September 26,1967

Ry the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

One hundred and eighty-eight years ago, Casimir Pulaski gave his life so that a young and valiant nation might live in freedom.

Barely thirty years old when, as a Polish patriot in exile, he came to fight with George Washington's Revolutionary Army, General Pulaski was richly endowed with the qualities of dedication and courage that have been the source of America's greatest strength.

He organized the first American cavalry unit, known as the Pulaski Legion, and served with great distinction at Brandywine and Germantown. He was mortally wounded on October 9, 1779 while leading his cavalry unit in a daring charge during the Battle of Savannah.

General Pulaski held the conviction that freedom is a nation's most cherished possession--that the erosion of freedom anywhere weakens freedom everywhere. Americans have fought many times for that conviction. We are fighting for it today in Vietnam.

I n memory of a gallant defender of our Nation, let us rededicate ourselves to the principles for which he gave his life--principles which millions of Polish immigrants to America have defended and strengthened over the years.

NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, L Y N D O N B. J O H N S O N , President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Wednesday, October 11, 1967, as General Pulaski's Memorial Day; and I direct the appropriate Government officials to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on that day.

The courage and determination of these intrepid seamen have inspired hundreds of thousands of Americans who trace their ancestry back to the Vikings. These qualities have long been a part of the American character, and have preserved and defended our Nation since its inception.

Proclamation 3809 NATIONAL FARM-CITY WEEK, 1967 3^ ^^^^ President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

I n less than a generation, the American farmer has created a greater agricultural abundance than his predecessors through all the generations of our history achieved.

One farmer today feeds and clothes himself and 39 others--almost four times as many as he sustained a quarter of a century ago.
This revolution wrought by the American farmer is one of the triumphs of our age. Even though he himself has not always received his fair share of the Nation's prosperity--a circumstance which his country in good conscience cannot permit to continue--he has helped to improve the conditions of life for every American.

The average consumer today enjoys a more abundant supply of food than any people has ever known--and he pays a lesser share of his income for it than ever before.
One of the most vital contributions to the achievements of American agriculture has been understanding and cooperation between farm and city--an interdependence that has supported our National development.
Moreover, American agriculture now represents hope for cities and villages far beyond our shores, where the spectre of poverty threatens the stability--and even the peace--of the world.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I , L Y N D O N B. J O H N S O N , President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week of November 17 through November 23, 1967, as National Farm-City Week, and call upon citizens throughout the Nation to participate in observance of that week.
I request that leaders of farmers' organizations, business groups and labor unions, youth and women's clubs, civic associations, and all consumers join in this observance to increase public appreciation of agriculture as the vital base of our Nation's economy and of our individual well-being.

I urge the Department of Agriculture, land-grant colleges and universities, the cooperative extension service, and all appropriate Government officials to cooperate with National, State, and local organizations in carrying out appropriate observations of National FarmCity Week, including public meetings and exhibits, and press, radio, and television features.

I urge that such programs emphasize:
--the necessity of facing the challenge of the future in agriculture simultaneously with meeting the needs of today--a theme which the Department of Agriculture calls "Agriculture/2000."
--the need to help hungry nations help themselves to become more productive--the ultimate solution to food shortage problems.
--the moral and practical imperative of creating a better total environment for all our citizens in both rural and urban communities, by removing the causes of poverty, discrimination, and ignorance, by controlling pollution, and by wisely and productively using our soil, water, forests, and other renewable resources.

Proclamation 3810
NATIONAL FOREST PRODUCTS WEEK, 1967
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
The vast timberlands which stretched across our continent were of vital importance to the men and women who settled America. In an often hostile land, forests provided the homes, food, tools and warmth for pioneer families.
Wood--the most basic forest resource--is no less vital to America today. From the forests that cover one-third of America's land area comes the material for thousands of products essential to the progress and well-being of our people.
And our forests help us preserve less tangible, but equally important qualities of our Nation:
--Our forests help us protect our watersheds, providing water for farming, leisure, industry, and human consumption.
--They shelter and feed wildlife, and preserve for us simplicity and beauty, helping us to find reserves of quiet strength in a tumultuous world.
Our forests must be renewed so that the great heritage that we received may be enjoyed again by those who come after us. We look to industry, and to each individual American, to help insure the wise use of our forests and its resources, so that renewal will continue.
The Congress, in order to reemphasize the importance of maintaining and restoring our forest resources, has by a joint resolution of September 13,1960 (74 Stat. 898), designated the seven-day period beginning on the third Sunday of October in each year as National Forest Products Week, and has requested the President to issue annually a proclamation calling for the observance of that week.
NOW, T H E K E F O R E , I, LYNDON B . J O H N S O N , President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon the people of the United States to observe the week beginning October 15, 1967, as National Forest Products Week, with activities and ceremonies designed to direct public attention to the essential role that our forest resources play in stimulating the advancement of our economy and the continued prosperity of the entire Nation.

Proclamation 3811
FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE LANGLEY RESEARCH CENTER
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamtion
The Langley Research Center this year marks its fiftieth year as a national resource. Established in 1917, it was the first national laboratory to conduct basic research in the science of aeronautics.
During the last fifty years the speed of airplanes has increased from less than 100 miles an hour to more than 4,000 miles an hour, and the exciting epoch of the exploration of space has begun.
Langley's contributions have been many. Among them are:
--^The development in the late Twenties of the cowling for radial air-cooled engines, a streamlining effect that boosted airplane speeds 12 to 15 percent.
--The scientific information and technical skills needed to increase the performance and utility of World W a r I I aircraft.
--The research facilities that made possible the advancement of supersonic and hypersonic aircraft.
--The investigations into concepts of advance supersonic and hypersonic vehicles, helicopters, and vertical and short takeoff and landing aircraft.
The passive communications satellite Echo owes much to Langley research as does the Explorer series of spacecraft that has taught us so much about the space environment in which we live.
Research at Langley contributed to the development of the versatile Scout vehicle, first of the all-solid-fueled rockets, as well as to the management of Lunar Orbiter and other such major flight efforts as Project Fire.
Langley was the birthplace of Project Mercury, the first United States manned space flight project. Important research was continued there in support of our continuing manned flight efforts, Gemini and Apollo.
The Center is supporting Project Apollo through the use of simulators and specialized laboratories. Through those facilities, we are able to simulate on earth some of the conditions of space and to develop techniques for such events as lunar landing, walking on the moon, extra-vehicular activities, rendezvous and docking m lunar orbit, reentry, and earthlanding.
I n recognition of the Langley Research Center's contribution to the advancement of the United States in aeronautics and astronautics, ^}jg Cougress, by a joint resolution approved October 3, 1967, has requested the President to issue a proclamation commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the establishment of the Langley Research Center.

Proclamation 3812

NATIONAL DAY OF PRAYER, 1967

By the President of the United States of America

October 6, 1967

A Proclamation

Abraham Lincoln, leaving his beloved Illinois to assume the office of President, told his friends in farewell:

I now leave, not knowing when or whether ever I may return, with a task before me greater than that which rested upon Washington, Without the assistance of the Divine Being who ever attended him, I cannot succeed. With that assistance, I cannot fail. Trusting in Him who can go with me, and remain with you, and be everywhere for good, let us confidently hope that all will yet be well. To His care commending you, as I hope in your prayers you will commend me, I bid you an affectionate farewell.

A t every moment of crisis, in every hour of trial, our people have prayed for guidance and strength from their Creator. On that day when Americans first declared themselves to be free, they appealed to "the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions."

Today, favored as we have been as a land and people, we have not forgotten the ultimate source of every power for good. I n churches, in homes, or, as St. Paul said, "In sighs too deep for words," we pray that "in the time of prosperity, fill our hearts with thankfulness. And in the day of trouble, suffer not our trust in Thee to fail."

Sensible of our people's faith, the Congress, by a joint resolution of April 17, 1952, provided that the President "shall set aside and proclaim a suitable day each year, other than a Sunday, as a National Day of Prayer, on which the people of the United States may turn to God in prayer and meditation at churches, in groups, and as individuals."

^ ^^^' fg^g-

NOW, T H E K E F O E E , I, L Y N D O N B . J O H N S O N , President of the United States of America, do hereby set aside Wednesday, October 18,1967, as National Day of Prayer, 1967.

Let each of us pray that God will endow us with the constancy to prevail in defense of freedom, and with the courage and resolution to preserve and extend His blessings of liberty.

Let us ask God to enlighten the minds of all our people so that we may work together to remove the inequalities that are among us. Let us pray that the Supreme Lawgiver will inspire all Americans to take the law into our hearts, not into our hands, and teach us all a respect for the rights of our fellowmen.

Proclamation 3813
COLUMBUS DAY, 1967
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Four hundred and seventy-five years ago, Christopher Columbus set off from Spain through perilous seas on one of history's most challenging--and most rewarding explorations. His perseverance through storms and testing is part of the living legend of the man and tne heritage of this Nation, whose gates he opened.
Like Columbus, we are constantly seeking new paths to the future. A t home, we seek to fulfill our dreams of a society of prosperity and justice for all Americans. Abroad, we strive to build a new world of peace, with freedom and dignity for all men.
In acknowledging our legacy from the great explorer, Christopher Columbus, we also honor the Italian nation from which he came. Millions of his countrymen have followed him to the New World. They have helped to forge the cultural, economic, and political strength of this Nation. America is proud of Columbus. America is proud of its people of Italian ancestry who have given so much to make our Nation great.
I n tribute to that great Captain, the Congress of the United States, by a joint resolution approved April 30,1934 (48 Stat. 657), requested the President to proclaim October 12 of each year as Columbus Day for the observance of the anniversary of the discovery of America.
NOW, T H E K E F O E E , I , L Y N D O N B. J O H N S O N , President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Thursday, October 12,1967, as Columbus Day; and I invite the people of this Nation to observe that day in schools, churches, and other suitable places with appropriate ceremonies in honor of the great explorer.
I also direct that the flag of the United States be displayed on all public buildings on the appointed day in memory of Christopher Columbus.
IN W I T N E S S W H E R E O F , I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixtyseven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-second.

Proclamation 3814

HUMAN RIGHTS WEEK AND HUMAN RIGHTS YEAR

By the President of the United States of America

October ii,i967

A Proclamation

The year 1968 will mark the twentieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of H u m a n Rights by the United Nations--an historic document of freedom that expresses man's deepest beliefs about the rights that every human being is born with, and that no government is entitled to deny.

The United Nations has designated 1968 as International Human Rights Year. I t has invited its members to intensify their domestic efforts to realize the aims of the Declaration.

Every American should remember, with pride and gratitude, that much of the leadership in the drafting and adoption of the Declaration came from a great American, Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt. She was our first representative on the U N Commission on Human Rights.

Today, October 11, would have been her 83rd birthday. With the inspiration of her humanitarian concern still before us, I call the attention of our people to the Declaration she helped to author.

To Americans, the rights embodied in the Declaration are familiar, but to many other people, in other lands, they are rights never enjoyed and only recently even aspired to.

The adoption of the Declaration by the United Nations established a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations. These principles were incorporated into Human Rights Conventions, to be ratified by the individual nations.

American ratification of these Conventions is long overdue. The principles they embody are part of our own national heritage. The rights and freedoms they proclaim are those which America has defended--and fights to defend--around the world.

It is my continuing hope that the United States Senate will ratify these conventions. This would present the world with another testament to our Nation's abiding belief in the inherent dignity and worth of the individual person. I t would speak again of the highest ideals of America.

NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, L Y N D O N B. J O H N S O N , President of the United States of America, in honor of the ratification of the American Bill of Rights, December 15,1791, and in honor of the adoption by the General Assembly of the United Nations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, December 10,1948, do hereby proclaim the week of December 10 through 17,1967, to be Human Rights Week and the year 1968 to be Human Rights Year. I n so doing, I call upon all Americans and upon all Government agencies--federal, state and local--to use this occasion to deepen our commitment to the defense of human rights and to strengthen our eft'orts for their full and effective realization both among our own people and among all the peoples of the United Nations.

NATIONAL UNICEF DAY

By the President of the United States of America

October 27, i967

A Proclamation 

The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) was established by the United Nations in 1946.

U N I C E F is dedicated to the welfare of children throughout the world--to eliminating the disease, hunger, and ignorance that afflicts them and their mothers.

U N I C E F is one of the most successful international efforts the world has ever known.

The American people have actively and generously supported the work of U N I C E F through their private efforts, and through the financial contributions of their Government. American children make their own very significant contribution through their annual Halloween collections for U N I C E F .

Yet, despite past efforts, three out of four of all the world's children continue to suffer in the shadow of poverty, hunger, and disease. There is an enormous job still to be done--for the world's future depends on the wholesome, healthy development of today's children.

I hope that the American people, and the peoples of all countries, will continue to support U N I C E F to the limits of their ability, both through their private efforts and through their governments.

NOW, T H E R E F O E E , I, L Y N D O N B. J O H N S O N , President of the United States of America, in honor of this great humanitarian enterprise, do hereby proclaim October 31, 1967, and October 31 in each subsequent year, as National U N I C E F Day.

Proclamation 3819
THANKSGIVING DAY, 1967
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
The first American tradition grew out of gratitude for survival.
It began--long before independence was a dream--with families responding to an even deeper human impulse. They had suffered the rigors of winter in a new world--and they had endured. They put aside their plows and thanked God for the harvest's bounty.
Over the years, we have made Thanksgiving a unique national occasion. Thanking God for His goodness, we thank Him as well for the promise and the achievement of America.
Our reasons for gratitude are almost without number. We are grateful for the endurance of our government for one hundred and eighty years. We are grateful that the founding fathers planned so wisely for the generations that followed them. We are grateful for a material abundance beyond any mankind has ever known. In our land, the harvests have been good.

Much as we are grateful for these material and spiritual blessings, we are conscious, in this year, of special sorrows and disappointments. We are engaged in a painful conflict in Asia, which was not of our choosing, and in which we are involved in fidelity to a sacred promise to help a nation which has been the victim of aggression. W e are proud of the spirit of our men who are risking their lives on Asian soil. We pray that their sacrifice will be redeemed in an honorable peace and the restoration of a land long torn by war.
We are grateful for the tremendous advances which have been made in our generation in social justice and in equality of opportunity, regardless of racial background. But we are saddened by the civil strife which has occurred in our great cities.
Recognizing the trials we have endured and are enduring, I have turned to the Thanksgiving Proclamation of President Abraham Lincoln in 1863. President Lincoln faced, with equal emphasis, both the blessings and the sorrows of the people.
He recommended to his fellow citizens that, "while offering up the ascriptions justly due to Him for such singular deliverances and blessings, they do also, with humble penitence for our national perverseness and disobedience, commend to His tender care all those who have become widows, orphans, mourners, or sufferers in the lamentable civil strife in which we are unavoidably engaged."
I n a similar spirit I ask my fellow citizens to join their thankfulness with penitence and humility. Let us implore Almighty God that, to all our other blessings, H e may add the blessings of wisdom and perseverance that will lead us to both peace and justice, in the family of nations and in our beloved homeland.
NOW, T H E R E F O E E , I , L Y N D O N B . J O H N S O N , President of the United States of America, in consonance with Section 6103 of Title 5 of the United States Code designating the fourth Thursday of November in each year as Thanksgiving Day, do hereby proclaim Thursday, November 23,1967 as a day of national thanksgiving.
IN W I T N E S S W H E R E O F , I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of November in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-second.

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
W H E E A S , pursuant to section 2 of the act of July 1, 1954, as amended (72 Stat. 678), and section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act Qf ^^952 (76 Stat. 877), findings and determinations have been made that adjustments in the imports of crude oil, unfinished oils, and finished products were necessary so that such imports would not threaten to impair the national security, such adjustments have been ^^^^ ^y Proclamation 3279 (24 F.R. 1781) and modified by Procla-

W H E R E A S , it appears that, as represented by the Virgin Islands Government, the development of petrochemical facilities in the Virgin Islands will provide a much needed increase in opportunities for employment of its citizens at job levels which will upgrade the standard of living in the Islands and will make available revenues for the control of air and water pollution, urban beautification, and conservation projects on the Islands, I find and determine that provision should be made to assist the development of petrochemical facilities in the Virgin Islands without impairment of the objectives of Proclamation 3279, as amended:
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, L Y N D O N B. J O H N S O N , President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the statutes, including section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, do hereby proclaim that:
1. The last sentence of subparagraph (1) of paragraph (a) of section 2 of Proclamation 3279, as amended, is amended to read as follows:
Within such maximum level, imports of unfinished oils shall not exceed such percentum of the permissible imports of crude oil and unfinished oils as the Secretary may determine and imports of finished products (other than residual fuel oil to be used as fuel) shall not exceed the level of imports of such products into these districts during the year 1957 except as the Secretary may find it necessary to adjust the 1957 level to accommodate an allocation made pursuant to the last sentence of subparagraph (4) of paragraph (b) of section 3, as amended.
2. A new sentence, reading as follows, is added to subparagraph (4) of paragraph (b) of section 3 of Proclamation 3279, as amended:
In addition the Secretary may make an allocation of imports, not in excess of 15,000 average barrels per day in any particular allocation period, into Districts I - I V of finished products other than residual fuel oil to be used as fuel if the Secretary determines that such action would not impair the accomplishment of the objectives of this proclamation and that such action would serve substantially to promote employment or substantially to upgrade opportunities for employment of Virgin Islanders or substantially to increase revenues received by the Virgin Islands, and the Secretary shall impose such conditions and restrictions upon such allocation as he may deem necessary to assure that the holder of the allocation fulfills commitments made in connection with the making of the allocation.
3. This amendatory proclamation shall take effect as of its date.
IN W I T N E S S W H E R E O F , I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of November in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-second.

Proclamation 3821

WRIGHT BROTHERS DAY, 1967

December 6, 1967

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

December 17 will mark the 64th anniversary of powered flight.

I t is difficult to believe that two pioneering brothers, Orville and Wilbur Wright, made the first successful flight in a heavier-than-air, mechanically propelled airplane just a little over threescore years ago. Few developments in technology have been so rapid as that of flight-- from the frail craft at Kitty Hawk to the great jet planes and space capsules of today.

The Wright brothers' epic flight--in a plane they designed, built, and flew themselves--lasted less than a minute. But their inventive genius revolutionized transportation, and gave rise to great new industries that have strengthened America's defense and economy.

36 u s e 169.

The names of Orville and Wilbur Wright symbolize American ingenuity and courage, and it is right that we should commemorate their achievements. To this end, the Congress by a joint resolution approved December 17,1963 (77 Stat. 402), has designated the seventeenth day of December of each year as Wright Brothers Day and has requested the President to issue annually a proclamation inviting the people of the United States to observe that day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.

NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I , L Y N D O N B. J O H N S O N , President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon the people of this Nation, and their local and national government officials, to observe Wright Brothers Day, December 17, 1967, with appropriate ceremonies and activities, both to recall the accomplishments of the W r i g h t brothers and to provide a stimulus to aviation in this country and throughout the world.

IN W I T N E S S W H E R E O F , I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of December, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixtyseven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-second.

EXPLANATION

The following tables are designed to serve as a guide to prior laws and other

Federal instruments which are patently amended, repealed, referred to, or otherwise

cited by the textual provisions of the public laws contained in this volume. These

tables were initiated as a separate pamphlet to accompany Volume 70 of the United

States Statutes at Large. Beginning with Volume 71, they are being published as

an integral part of each volume.

From time to time the tables will be cumulated and made separately available

as a convenience to users. Tables 1-9 of Volumes 70-79 covering the years 1956 through

1965 have been cumulated and published as a separate pamphlet. Coverage and arremge-

ment of the tables are subject to change with a view to improved usefulness.

The arrangement of the tables is outlined above. There are two basic groups:

(1) Tables 1-10 cover amendments, repeals, and other actions directly affecting prior

laws and other Federal instruments; and (2) Tables 11-19 cover all citations and

other references to prior laws and other Federal instruments.

Details of Arrangement.

Tables 1-9 are limited to cases in which prior laws and other Federal instruments

are expressly affected.

LAWS AFEECTED IN VOLUME 81

Table 10 is a catch-all table designed as a finding aid to relationships which are expressed in general terms. Listed in this table are all public laws in this volume which contain such provisions as "notwithstanding any other provision of law," and "all laws in conflict with this law are hereby repealed."
Tables 11-19 cover all other cases in which prior laws or other Federal instruments are mentioned in the text of the public laws in this volume, without regard to the purpose underlying such reference.
In each of the basic groups the first and largest table is entitled "General Legislation," and contains listings of all laws affected which have not been codified in the Revised Statutes, the Internal Revenue Codes, the Canal Zone Code, or in those titles of the United States Code or District of Columbia Code which have been enacted into law. Succeeding tables cover these codified provisions, as well as other instruments such as reorganization plans, veterans' regulations, Executive orders and proclamations, and treaties and international agreements. The numbering of the tables in the two groups is parallel. Thus Table 2 and Table 12 both relate to the Revised Statutes; Table 7 and Table 17 both relate to veterans' regulations.
Table 1 is arranged chronologically. In preparing this table the "basic act" principle has been followed. Under this principle the key listing of amendatory legislation will be found under the basic act affected, rather than under intervening amendments thereto. Furthermore, all laws included are treated as if tables covering prior volumes of the United States Statutes at Large were in existence. Thus, no attempt is made to give an historical picture of a law, and only the latest amendment in the chain wUl be reflected. Occasionally, to promote clarity, cross references have been supplied at key points.
Users of Table 1 should, therefore, look under the date, public law number, or statutes volume and page number of the basic act affected, in order to determine whether changes have been made by the public laws contained in this volume. Although a given section of any act may have been added at a later date, the section is carried under the date and statutes citation of the basic act. For this reason the page numbers in the column headed "Statutes volume and page" are the numbers of the page on which each act begins.
All tables are arranged chronologically, except where the existence of a system of codification makes possible a sequential arrangement from the lowest to the highest title or section number. In Tables 1-10 there is a "Comment" column, in which the nature of the affecting action is described. These are editorial comments, intended to reflect what is patent in the laws reviewed, and every effort has been made to avoid interpretations.
In Tables 11-19 the "Comment" column is unnecessary, since in each instance the comment would be "Cited" or "Referred to." In these tables, moreover, the number of columns has been held to a minimum in the interest of brevity. Thus Table 11 contains only three columns listing the date and number of the law referred to, and the page number in this volume at which the reference may be found.
Caveat.
All the tables are editoriaUy compiled and presented as reference guides only. Hence they have no evidentiary status or legal effect. Indirect or implied relationships are not included. These may be found through use of the Subject Index or through research based on the text itself.
The Office of the Federal Register invites criticisms or suggestions with a view to improving the tables wherever possible.
