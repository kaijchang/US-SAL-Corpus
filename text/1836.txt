(a) Decisions of the Courts of the United States on Insurance against Fire: Among the conditions which were printed on the same sheet with a policy of insurance against fire, was one requiring " that all persons insured, and sustaining loss or damage by fire, should forthwith give notice thereof to the company, and as soon after as possible deliver in a particular account of such loss or damage, signed with their own hands, and verified with their oath or affirmation, and also, if required, by their books of account and other proper vouchers." Held, that the particular account required by the above condition is a particular account of the articles lost or damaged, and does not refer to the manner and cause of the loss. Catlin v. The Springfield Ins. Co., 1 Sumner's C. C. R. 434. In stating a loss, it is sufficient to show it to have been occasioned by a peril within the policy, without negativing the exception of losses from design, invasion, public enemies, riots, &c.; which are properly matters of defence. Ibid. The words in a policy against fire,described the house as " at present occupied as a dwelling-house, but to be occupied hereafter as a tavern, and privileged as such." Held, that this is not a warranty that the house should, during the continuance of the risk, be constantly occupied as a tavern ; but that it is, at farthest, a mere representation of the intention to occupy it as such, and a license or privilege granted by the underwriters that it might be so occupied. Ibid. Where underwriters agree to make good any loss or damage "by fire originating in any cause, except design in the insured, invasion," &c., held, that the exception of losses by design admits all losses not by design ; that, therefore, where the plaintiff negligently left the premises insured derelict, and intruders came and burnt them, without any co-operation or knowledge on the part of the plaintiff, it is a loss within the policy. Ibid. The material inquiry is, does the offer for insurance state truly the interest of the assured in the property to be insured? The offer describes the property as belonging to Lawrence & Poindexter, and states it afterwards to be their stone mill. It contains no qualifying terms, which should lead the mind to suspect that their title was not complete and absolute. The title of the assured was subject to contingencies, and was held under contracts which had become void by the non-performance of the same. The supreme court is of opinion that a precarious title, depending for its continuance on events which might or might not happen, is not such a title as is described in this offer for insurance ; construing the words of that offer as they are fairly to be understood. The Columbian Ins. Co. v. Lawrence, 2 Peters, 48. The contract for insurance against fire is one in which the underwriter generally acts on the representation of the assured ; and that representation ought consequently to be fair, and to omit nothing which it is material to the underwriter to know. It may not be necessary that the person requiring insurance should state every incumbrance on his property, which it might be required of him to state if it was offered for sale ; but fair dealing requires that he should state everything which might influence the mind of the underwriter in forming or declining the contract.

fire. They have a tendency to keep premiums down to the lowest rates, and to uphold institutions of this sort, so essential to the present state of the country for the protection of the vast interests embarked in manufactures, and on consignments of goods in warehouses. Ibid.
Questions on a policy of insurance are of general commercial law, and depend upon the construction of a contract of insurance, which is by no means local in its character, or regulated by any local policy or customs. Ibid.
The Circuit Court charged the jury, that at law, whatever might be the case in equity, mere parol notice of another insurance on the same property was not a compliance with the terms of the policy; and that it was necessary in the case of such prior policy, that the same should not only be notified to the company, but should be mentioned in or endorsed on the policy; otherwise the insurance was to be void and of no effect. Held, that this instruction of the Circuit Court was correct. It never can be properly said that the stipulation in the policy is complied with, when there has been no such mention or endorsement as it positively requires ; without which it declares that the policy shall be void and of no effect.

Chap . XXXVIII.--Jin Act to incorporate afire insurance company, in the town of
Alexandria, in the District of Columbia. (a)

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the persons who were

(a) Decisions of the Courts of the United States on Insurance against Fire: Among the conditions which were printed on the same sheet with a policy of insurance against fire, was one requiring " that all persons insured, and sustaining loss or damage by fire, should forthwith give notice thereof to the company, and as soon after as possible deliver in a particular account of such loss or damage, signed with their own hands, and verified with their oath or affirmation, and also, if required, by their books of account and other proper vouchers." Held, that the particular account required by the above condition is a particular account of the articles lost or damaged, and does not refer to the manner and cause of the loss. Catlin v. The Springfield Ins. Co., 1 Sumner's C. C. R. 434. In stating a loss, it is sufficient to show it to have been occasioned by a peril within the policy, without negativing the exception of losses from design, invasion, public enemies, riots, &c.; which are properly matters of defence. Ibid. The words in a policy against fire,described the house as " at present occupied as a dwelling-house, but to be occupied hereafter as a tavern, and privileged as such." Held, that this is not a warranty that the house should, during the continuance of the risk, be constantly occupied as a tavern ; but that it is, at farthest, a mere representation of the intention to occupy it as such, and a license or privilege granted by the underwriters that it might be so occupied. Ibid. Where underwriters agree to make good any loss or damage "by fire originating in any cause, except design in the insured, invasion," &c., held, that the exception of losses by design admits all losses not by design ; that, therefore, where the plaintiff negligently left the premises insured derelict, and intruders came and burnt them, without any co-operation or knowledge on the part of the plaintiff, it is a loss within the policy. Ibid. The material inquiry is, does the offer for insurance state truly the interest of the assured in the property to be insured? The offer describes the property as belonging to Lawrence & Poindexter, and states it afterwards to be their stone mill. It contains no qualifying terms, which should lead the mind to suspect that their title was not complete and absolute. The title of the assured was subject to contingencies, and was held under contracts which had become void by the non-performance of the same. The supreme court is of opinion that a precarious title, depending for its continuance on events which might or might not happen, is not such a title as is described in this offer for insurance ; construing the words of that offer as they are fairly to be understood. The Columbian Ins. Co. v. Lawrence, 2 Peters, 48. The contract for insurance against fire is one in which the underwriter generally acts on the representation of the assured ; and that representation ought consequently to be fair, and to omit nothing which it is material to the underwriter to know. It may not be necessary that the person requiring insurance should state every incumbrance on his property, which it might be required of him to state if it was offered for sale ; but fair dealing requires that he should state everything which might influence the mind of the underwriter in forming or declining the contract. Ibid. 49.

the proprietors of the stock of the late fire insurance company of the town of Alexandria, on the eighth day of March, eighteen hundred and thirty-five, and the representatives and assigns of such of them as have since that time died, or transferred their interests, be, and the same are, hereby incorporated and declared to be a body politic, under the name
and style of the Fire Insurance Company of Alexandria.

Certain persons incorporated as a fire insurance company.

The description of the property insured must be such as the property is, and not such as will in any way reduce the rate of the premium. Ibid., 56.
The doctrine, as applied to policies against fire on land, has for a great length of time prevailed, that losses occasioned by the mere fault or negligence of the assured, or his servants, unaffected by fraud or design, are within the protection of the policy, and as such are recoverable from the underwriters. This doctrine is fully established in England and America. Waters v. The Merchants' Louisville Ins. Co., 11 Peters, 213.
It is a well established principle of the common law, that in all cases of loss we are to attribute it to the proximate cause, and not to the remote cause. This has become a maxim to govern cases arising under policies of insurance. Ibid.
L. & P. at the time an insurance was made for them against loss by fire, were entitled to one third of the property by deed, and to two thirds as mortgagees; but one moiety of the whole was held under an agreement which had not been complied with, and which purported on its face to be void, if not complied with; but the other contracting party had not declared it void, nor called for a compliance with it. L. & P. had an insurable interest in the property. The Columbian Ins. Co. v. Lawrence, 2 Peters, 46.
That an equitable interest may be insured, is admitted; and the court perceive no reason which excludes an interest held under an executory contract. While the contract subsists, the person claiming under it has undoubtedly a substantial interest in the property. If it be destroyed, the loss, in contemplation of law, is his. If the purchase money be paid, it is his in fact. If he owes the purchase money, the property is equivalent, and is still valuable to him. The embarrassment of his affairs may be such that his debts may absorb all his property; but this circumstance has never been considered as proving a want of interest in it. The destruction of the property is a real loss to the person in possession, who claims title under an executory contract; and the contingency that his title may be defeated by subsequent events does not prevent this loss. Ibid. 46.
Action on a policy of insurance on the " Glenco Cotton Factory," against loss or damage by fire. The policy was dated the 27th day of September, 1838, and was to endure for one year. The policy contained a clause by which it was stipulated by the assured, that if any other insurance on the property had been made, and had not been notified to the assurers, and mentioned in or endorsed on the policy, the insurance should be void ; and if afterwards any insurance should be made on the property, and the assured should not give notice of the same to the assurers, and have the same endorsed on the policy, or otherwise acknowledged by the assured in writing, the policy should cease; and in case any other insurance on the property, prior or subsequent to this policy, should be made, the assured should not, in case of loss, be entitled to recover more than the portion of the loss should bear to the whole amount insured on the property ; the interest of the assured in the property not to be assignable, unless by consent of the assurers, manifested in writing; and if any sale or transfer of the property without such consent is made, the policy to be void and of no effect. On all the policies of insurance made by the insurance company, there was a printed notice of the conditions on which the insurance was made. The declaration alleged that Carpenter was the owner of the property insured, and was interested in the same to the whole amount insured by the policy; and that the property had been destroyed by fire. The facts of the case showed that the property had been mortgaged for a part of the purchase money, and the policy of insurance was held for the benefit of the mortgagor. Another insurance was made by another insurance company, but this was not communicated in writing to the Providence Washington Insurance Company; nor was the same assented to by them, nor was a memorandum thereof made on the policy. By the Court: No doubt can exist that the mortgagor and the mortgagee may each separately insure his own distinct interest in property against loss by fire. But there is this important distinction between the cases ; that where the mortgagee insures solely on his own account, it is but an insurance of his debt; and if his debt is afterwards paid or extinguished, the policy ceases from that time to have any operation; and even if the premises insured are subsequently destroyed by fire, he has no right to recover for the loss, for he sustains no damage thereby; neither can the mortgagor take advantage of the policy, for he has no interest whatsoever therein: on the other hand, if the premises are destroyed by fire, before any payment or extinguishment of the mortgage, the underwriters are bound to pay the amount of the debt to the mortgagee, if it does not exceed the insurance. Upon such payment, the underwriters are entitled to an assignment of the debt from the mortgagee, and may recover the same from the mortgagor. The payment of the insurance is not a discharge of the debt, but only changes the creditor. Carpenter v. The Providence Washington Insurance Company, 16 Peters, 495.
When the insurance is made by the mortgagor, he will, notwithstanding the mortgage or other encumbrance, be entitled to recover the full amount of his loss, not exceeding the insurance, since the whole loss is his own. The mortgagee can only insure to the amount of his debt; whereas the mortgagor can insure to the full value of the property, notwithstanding any encumbrances thereon. Ibid.
An assignment of a policy by the assured only covers such interest in the premises as he may have had at the time of the insurance, and at the time of the loss. If a loss takes place after the policy has been assigned, the assignee alone is entitled to recover. The rights of the assignee under the policy cannot be more extensive than the rights of the assignor. Cited the Columbia Insurance Company v. Lawrence, 10 Peters, 507, 512; 2 Peters, 25, 49. Ibid.
Policies of insurance against fire are not deemed in their nature incidents to the property insured, but they are mere special agreements with the person insuring against such loss or damage as they may sustain ; and not the loss or damage that any other person having an interest as grantee, or mortgagee, or creditor, or otherwise, may sustain by reason of the subsequent destruction by fire. Ibid.
The public have an interest in maintaining the validity of the clauses in a policy of insurance against

Questions on a policy of insurance are of general commercial law, and depend upon the construction of a contract of insurance, which is by no means local in its character, or regulated by any local policy or customs. Ibid.
The Circuit Court charged the jury, that at law, whatever might be the case in equity, mere parol notice of another insurance on the same property was not a compliance with the terms of the policy; and that it was necessary in the case of such prior policy, that the same should not only be notified to the company, but should be mentioned in or endorsed on the policy; otherwise the insurance was to be void and of no effect. Held, that this instruction of the Circuit Court was correct. It never can be properly said that the stipulation in the policy is complied with, when there has been no such mention or endorsement as it positively requires ; without which it declares that the policy shall be void and of no effect.

Duties relating to public lands under supervision of the commissioner.

(a) Decisions of the courts of the United States upon land titles from the United States, and titles to the public lands:
Under the act of Congress of March 3, 1803, entitled "An act regulating the grants of land, and providing for the sale of the lands of the United States, south of the State of Tennessee," such lands only were authorized to be sold as had not been appropriated by the previous sections of the law, and certificates granted by the commissioners in pursuance thereof. A right, therefore, to a particular tract of land, derived from a donation certificate given under that law, is superior to the title of any one who purchased the same land at the public sales, unless there is some fatal infirmity in the certificate, which renders it void. Ross v. Barland et al. 1 Peters, 666.
An act of Congress requires no precise form for the donation certificate. It is sufficient if the proofs be exhibited to the court of commissioners, to satisfy them of the facts entitling the party to the certificate. It is sufficient if the consideration, to wit, the occupancy, and the quantity granted, appears. Nothing more is necessary to certify to the government the party's right, or to enable him, after it is surveyed by the proper officer, to obtain a patent. Ibid.

Duties relating to public lands under supervision of the commissioner.

(a) Decisions of the courts of the United States upon land titles from the United States, and titles to the public lands:
Under the act of Congress of March 3, 1803, entitled "An act regulating the grants of land, and providing for the sale of the lands of the United States, south of the State of Tennessee," such lands only were authorized to be sold as had not been appropriated by the previous sections of the law, and certificates granted by the commissioners in pursuance thereof. A right, therefore, to a particular tract of land, derived from a donation certificate given under that law, is superior to the title of any one who purchased the same land at the public sales, unless there is some fatal infirmity in the certificate, which renders it void. Ross v. Barland et al. 1 Peters, 666.
An act of Congress requires no precise form for the donation certificate. It is sufficient if the proofs be exhibited to the court of commissioners, to satisfy them of the facts entitling the party to the certificate. It is sufficient if the consideration, to wit, the occupancy, and the quantity granted, appears. Nothing more is necessary to certify to the government the party's right, or to enable him, after it is surveyed by the proper officer, to obtain a patent. Ibid.

108

TWENTY-FOURTH CONGRESS. Sess . I. Ch . 352. 1836.

of the public lands of the United States, or in anywise respecting such public lands, and, also, such as relate to private claims of land, and the issuing of patents for all grants of land under the authority of the Government of the United States, shall be subject to the supervision and control of the Commissioner of the General Land Office, under the direction of the President of the United States.
The second section of the act of Congress of March 3, 1803, was intended to confer a bounty on a numerous class of individuals, and in construing the ambiguous words of the section, it is the duty of the court to adopt that construction which will best effect the liberal intentions of the Legislature. Ibid. 667.
The time when the territory over which this law operated was evacuated by the Spanish troops, was very important, as the law was intended to provide for those who were actually at that time inhabitants of, and cultivated the soil within it; but whether it was in 1797 or 1798, was comparatively unimportant. The decision of the commissioners upon the period when the evacuation took place, is sufficient: and the court are disposed to adopt the construction of the act given by the commissioners west of Pearl river; that the evacuation took place on the 30th March 1798, by which persons coming within the objects of the section were entitled to donation certificates. Ibid. 667.
Congress have treated as erroneous the construction given to the law by the commissioners to settle claims to lands east of Pearl river, who have decided that only those who were settled on the lands within the territory in the year 1797 were entitled to donation certificates, and who had granted to others pre-emption certificates. Ibid. 668.
The commissioners appointed under the act of Congress relative to claims to lands of the United States south of the State of Tennessee, were authorized to hear evidence as to the time of the actual evacuation of the territory by the Spanish troops, and to decide upon the fact. The law gave them power to hear and decide all matters respecting such claims, and to determine thereon, according to justice and equity; and declared their deliberations shall be final. The court are bound to presume that every fact necessary to warrant the certificate, in the terms of it, was proved before the commissioners; and that, consequently, it was shown to them that the final evacuation of the territory by the Spanish troops took place on the 30th of March 1798. Ibid.
By the treaty of St. Ildefonso, made on the 1st of October 1800, Spain ceded Louisiana to France; and France, by the treaty of Paris, signed the 30th of April 1803, ceded it to the United States. Under this treaty, the United States claimed the countries between the Iberville and the Perdido. Spain contended that her cession to France comprehended only that territory which at the time of the cession was denominated Louisiana, consisting of the island of New Orleans, and the country which had been originally ceded to her by France, west of the Mississippi. The land claimed by the plaintiffs in error, under a grant from the crown of Spain, made after the treaty of St. Ildefonso, lies within the disputed territory ; and this case presents the question, to whom did the country between the Iberville and Perdido belong after the treaty of St. Ildefonso ? Had France and Spain agreed upon the boundaries of the retroceded territory before Louisiana was acquired by the United States, that agreement would undoubtedly have ascertained its limits. But the declarations of France, made after parting with the province, cannot be admitted as conclusive. In questions of this character, political considerations have too much influence over the conduct of nations, to permit their declarations to decide the course of an independent government, in a matter vitally interesting to itself. Foster et al. v. Neilson, 2 Peters, 306.
If a Spanish grantee had obtained possession of the land in dispute so as to be the defendant, would a court of the United States maintain his title under a Spanish grant, made subsequent to the acquisition of Louisiana, singly on the principle that the Spanish construction of the treaty of St. Ildefonso was right, and the American construction wrong ? Such a decision would subvert those principles which govern the relations between the legislative and judicial departments, and mark the limits of each. Ibid. 309.
The sound construction of the eighth article of the treaty between the United States and Spain, of the 22d of February 1829, will not enable the court to apply its provisions to the case of the plaintiff. Ibid. 314.
The article does not declare that all the grants made by his catholic majesty before the 24th of January, 1818, shall be valid to the same extent as if the ceded territories had remained under his dominion. It does not say that those grants are hereby confirmed. Had such been its language, it would have acted directly on the subject, and it would have repealed those acts of Congress which were repugnant to it; but its language is, that those grants shall be ratified and confirmed to the persons in possession, &c. By whom shall they be ratified and confirmed ? This seems to be the language of contract; and, if it is, the ratification and confirmation which are promised must be the act of the Legislature. Until such act shall be passed, the court is not at liberty to disregard the existing laws on the subject. Ibid.
A title to lands, under grants made by Indian tribes or nations, north-west of the river Ohio, to private individuals, in the years 1773 and 1775, cannot be sustained in the courts of the United States. Lessee of Johnson et al. v. M'Intosh, 8 Wheat. 543 ; 5 Cond. Rep. 515.
The title to lands depends entirely upon the law of the nation in which they lie. Ibid. Discovery constitutes the original foundation of title to lands on the American continent, as between the different European nations ; the title thus derived, was the exclusive right of acquiring the soil from the natives, and establishing settlements upon it; the title was to be consummated by possession. Ibid. The rights of the original inhabitants were, to a considerable extent, impaired, but in no instance entirely disregarded. The Europeans respected the right of the natives as occupants, but asserted the ultimate dominion to be in themselves; and claimed and exercised, as a consequence of this ultimate dominion, a power to grant the soil while yet in the possession of the natives. Ibid. By the treaty between Great Britain and the United States, which concluded our revolution, the powers of government and the right to soil which had previously been in Great Britain, passed definitively to these States. Ibid. The United States, or the several States, have a clear title to all the lands within the boundary lines described in the treaty, subject only to the Indian right of occupancy ; and the exclusive power to extinguish that right was vested in that government which might constitutionally exercise it. Ibid. It is a principle of universal law, that, if an uninhabited country be discovered by a number of indivi-

duals, who acknowledge no connection with, and owe no allegiance to any government whatever, the country becomes the property of the discoverers in common, so far as they can use it. Ibid.
If the discovery be made and possession taken under the authority of an existing government, which is acknowledged by the emigrants, the discovery is made for the whole nation; the country becomes a part of the nation ; and the vacant soil is to be disposed of by that organ of the government which has the constitutional power to dispose of the national domains. Ibid.
According to the theory of the British constitution, all vacant lands are vested in the crown as representing the nation; and the exclusive power to grant them is admitted to reside in the crown as a branch of the royal prerogative. Ibid.
Congress, in order to guard against imposition, declared by the law of 1804 that all grants of land made by the Spanish authorities in the territory west of the Perdido, after the treaty of St. Udefonso, should be null and void, excepting those to actual settlers, acquired before December 20, 1803. Garcia v. Lee,
12 Peters, 511. The controversy relative to the country lying between the Mississippi and the Perdido rivers, and the
validity of the grants made by Spain in the disputed territory after the cession of Louisiana to the United States, were carefully examined in the case of Foster & Elam v. Neilson. The Supreme Court in that case decided that the question of boundary between the United States and Spain was a question for the political departments of the government: that the legislative and executive branches having decided the question, the courts of the United States are bound to regard the boundary determined by them as the true one; that grants made by the Spanish authorities of lands, which, according to this boundary line, belonged to the United States, gave no title to the grantees in opposition to those claiming under the United States, unless the Spanish grants were protected by the subsequent arrangements made between the two governments; and that no such arrangements were to be found in the treaty of 1819, by which Spain ceded the Floridas to the United States, according to the fair import of its words, and its true construction. Ibid.
In the case of Foster & Elam v. Neilson, the Supreme Court said that the Florida treaty of 1819 declares that all grants made before the 24th of January 1818, by the Spanish authorities, " shall be ratified and confirmed to the persons in possession of the lands, to the same extent that the same grants would be valid, if the territories had remained under the dominion of his catholic majesty:" and in deciding the case of Foster & Elam, the court held, that even if this stipulation applied to lands in the territory in question, yet the words used did not import a present confirmation by virtue of the treaty itself, but that they were words of contract: " that the ratification and confirmation which were promised must be the act of the Legislature ; and until such shall be passed, the court is not entitled to disregard the existing laws on the subject." Afterwards, in the case of the United States v. Percheman, 7 Peters, 86, in reviewing the words of the eighth article of the treaty, the court, for the reasons there assigned, came to a different conclusion, and held that the words were words of present confirmation, by the treaty, where the land had been rightfully granted before the cession, and that it did not need the aid of an act of Congress to ratify and confirm the grant. This language was, however, applied by the court, and was intended to apply, to grants made in a territory which belonged to Spain at the time of the grant. The case then before the court was one of that description. It was in relation to a grant of land in Florida, which unquestionably belonged to Spain at the time the grant was made, and where the Spanish authorities had an undoubted right to grant, until the treaty of cession in 1819. It is of such grants that the court speak, when they declare them to be confirmed and protected by the true construction of the treaty, and that they do not need the aid of an act. of Congress to ratify and confirm the title of the purchaser. The court do not apply this principle to grants made within the territory of Louisiana. The case of Foster & Elam v. Neilson must, in all other respects, be considered as affirmed by the case of Percheman ; as it underwent a careful examination in that case, and as none of its principles were questioned except that referred to. Ibid.
The power over the public lands is vested in Congress by the constitution without limitation, and has been considered as the foundation on which the territorial government rests. The United States v. Gratiot et al., 14 Peters, 529.
The words " dispose of" the public lands, used in the constitution of the United States, cannot, under the decisions of the Supreme Court, receive any other construction than that Congress has the power in its discretion to authorize the keeping of the lead-mines on the public lands in the territories of the United States. There can be no apprehensions of encroaching on State rights by the creation of a numerous tenantry within the borders of a State, from such reasons. Ibid.
The authority as given to the President of the United States to lease the lead-mines, is limited to a term not exceeding five years. This limitation, however, is not to be construed to be a prohibition to renew the leases from time to time, if he thinks proper so to do. The authority is limited to a short period, so as not to interfere with the power of Congress to make other dispositions of the mines, should they think the same necessary. Ibid.
The law of 1807, authorizing the leasing of the lead-mines, was passed before Illinois was organized as a State. She cannot now complain of any disposition or regulation of the lead-mines previously made by Congress. She, secondly, cannot claim a right to the public lands within her limits. Ibid.
Under the acts of 1805, chap. 26, 1806, chap. 39, 1807, chap. 36, it was necessary to file the evidence of an incomplete claim under French or Spanish authority, which bore date anterior to the 1st of October 1800, as well as those which were dated subsequent to that day; and in cases of neglect, the bar provided in the act applied to both classes. Ibid.
A title resting on a permit to settle and warrant of survey, dated before the 1st of October 1800, without settlement or survey of any kind having been made, was an incomplete title within that act. Ibid.

In making an entry of land, where mistakes occur which are occasioned by the impracticability of ascertaining the relative positions of the objects called for, the court will correct those mistakes, so as to carry out the intentions of the locator. Croghan's lessee v. Nelson, 3 Howard, 187.
There is no principle of the common law which forbids individuals from associating together to purchase lands from the United States, on joint account, at public sale. Olner v. Pratt, 3 Howard, 333.
Where the purchaser of land from the United States has paid for it, and received a final certificate, it is taxable property, according to the statute of Michigan, although a patent has not been issued. Carroll v. Salford, 3 Howard, 441.
Taxation upon lands so held is not a violation of the ordinance of 1787, as "an interference with the primary disposition of the soil by Congressnor is it a tax on the lands of the United States. The State of Michigan could rightfully impose the tax. Ibid.
It was competent to the State to assess and tax lands at their full value, as the absolute property of the holder of the final certificate; and, in default of payment, to sell them as if he owned them in fee. Ibid.
The act of 26th May 1830, chap. 106, providing for the final settlement of land claims in Florida, must be construed to contain the same limitation of time, within which claims are to be presented, as that provided by the act of May 23, 1828, chap. 70. The United States v. Marvin, 3 Howard, 620.
Under the act of Congress providing for the subdivision of the public lands, and the instructions of the Secretary of the Treasury, made under the act of 24th April 1820, chap. 49, entitled, An act making further provision for the sale of the public lands, it is the duty of the Surveyor General to leave out a fractional section in such a manner as that an entire quarter section may be had, if the fraction will admit of it. Brown's Lessee v. Clements, 3 Howard, 650.
The Surveyor General has no right to divide a fractional section by arbitrary lines, so as to prevent an entire quarter section from being taken up. Ibid.
The treaty by which Louisiana wras ceded to the United States, recognised complete grants, issued anterior to the cession ; and the decision of a State court against the validity of a grant set up under such a title, would be subject to reversal by the Supreme Court, under the 25th section of the Judiciary Act. M'Donogh v. Millaudon, 3 Howard, 693.
But if the State court only applies the laws of the State to the construction of the grant, it is not a decision against the validity of the grant, and the Supreme Court has no jurisdiction. Ibid.
Congress, in asking a complete grant, recognised them as they stood; and the act of May 11, 1820, chap. 87, confirming such as were recommended for confirmation by the register and receiver, had no reference to any particular surveys. A decision of a State court, therefore, which may be in opposition to one of these surveys, is not against the validity of a title existing under an act of Congress; and the Supreme Court has no jurisdiction. Ibid.
By the treaty of 1795 between the United States and Spain, by which Spain admitted that she had no title to land north of the 31st degree of north latitude, her previous grants of land so situated were of course void. The country thus belonging to Georgia was ceded to the United States in 1802, with a reservation that all persons who were actual settlers on the 27th October 1795, should have their grants confirmed. Congress provided a board of commissioners to examine these grants, and declared that their decision should be final. The Court of Chancery of Mississippi had no right to establish one of these grants which had not been brought within the provisions of the act of Congress. The claim itself being utterly void, and no power having been conferred by Congress on that court to take or exercise jurisdiction over it, for the purpose of imparting to it legality, the exercise of jurisdiction was a mere usurpation of judicial power, and the whole proceeding of the court void. Lessor of Hickey, v. Stewart, 3 Howard, 750.
The Supreme Court has repeatedly declared, and in cases too where the instrument contained clear words of grant, that if the description was vague and indefinite, and there was no official survey to give a certain location, it could give no right of private property in any particular parcel of land, which could be maintained in a court of justice. The United States v. King et al. 3 Howard, 773.
An equitable title is no defence in a suit at law brought by the United States. An imperfect title, derived from Spain before the cession, cannot be supported against a party claiming under a grant from the United States. Ibid.
The act of Congress of 29th April 1816, chap. 159, confirming the grant to a league square, restricted it to that quantity, and cannot be construed as confirming the residue. Ibid.
The act of Congress, entitled "An act to create additional land districts in the States of Illinois and Missouri, and the territories north of the State of Illinois," approved June 26, 1834, chap. 76, does nor require the President of the United States to cause to be offered for sale the public lands containing lead-mines, situated in the land districts created by the said act. United States v. Gear, 3 Howard, 120.
The lands containing lead-mines in the Indiana territory, or in that part of it made into a new land district by the act of 26th June 1834, chap. 76, are not subject, under any of the pre-emption laws which have been passed by Congress, to pre-emption by settlers upon the public lands. Ibid.
Digging lead-ore from the lead-mines upon the public lands of the United States, is such a waste as entitles the United States to a writ of injunction to restrain it. Ibid.
The United States now hold the public lands in the new States by force of the deeds of cession, and the statutes connected with them, and not by any municipal sovereignty which it may be supposed they possess or have received by compact with the new States for that purpose. Pollard's Lessee v. Hagan, 3 Howard, 212.
The shores of navigable rivers, and the soil under them, were not granted to the United States, but were reserved to the States respectively; and the new States have the same rights, sovereignty and jurisdiction over this subject, as the original States. Ibid.

Every such patent shall contain a short description or title of the invention or discovery, correctly indicating its nature and design, and in its terms grant to the applicant or applicants, his or their heirs, administrators, executors, or assigns, for a term not exceeding fourteen years, the full and exclusive right and liberty of making, using, and vending to others to be used, the said invention or discovery, referring to the specifications for the particulars thereof, a copy of which shall be annexed to the patent, specifying what the patentee claims as his invention or discovery.
Sec . 6. And be it further enacted, That any person or persons having discovered or invented any new and useful art, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement on any art, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, not known or used by others before his or their discovery or invention thereof, and not, at the time of his application for a patent, in public use or on sale, with his consent or allowance, as the inventor or discoverer; and shall desire to obtain an exclusive property therein, may make application in writing to the Commissioner of Patents, expressing such desire, and the Commissioner, on due proceedings had, may grant a patent therefor. But before any inventor shall receive a patent for any such new invention or discovery, he shall deliver a written description of his invention or discovery, and of the manner and process of making, constructing, using, and compounding the same, in such full, clear, and exact terms, avoiding unnecessary prolixity, as to enable any person skilled in the art or science to which it appertains, or with which it is most nearly connected, to make, construct, compound, and use the same; and in case of any machine, he shall fully explain the principle and the several modes in which he has contemplated the application of that principle or character by which it may be distinguished from other inventions; and shall particularly specify and point out the part, improvement, or combination, which he claims as his own invention or discovery. He shall, furthermore, accompany the whole with a drawing, or drawings, and written references, where the nature of the case admits of drawings, or with specimens of ingredients, and of the composition of matter, sufficient in quantity for the purpose of experiment, where the invention or discovery is of a composition of matter; which descriptions and drawings, signed by the inventor and attested by two witnesses, shall be filed in the Patent Office; and he shall moreover furnish a model of his invention, in all cases which admit of a representation by model, of a convenient size to exhibit advantageously its several parts. The applicant shall also make oath or affirmation that he does verily believe that he is the original and first inventor or discoverer of the art, machine, composition, or improvement, for which he solicits a patent, and that he does not know or believe that the same was ever before known or used; and also of what country he is a citizen; which oath or affirmation may be made before any person authorized by law to administer oaths.
Sec . 7. And be it further enacted, That, on the filing of any such application, description, and specification, and the payment of the duty hereinafter provided, the Commissioner shall make or cause to be made, an examination of the alleged new invention or discovery; and if, on any such examination, it shall not appear to the Commissioner that the same had been invented or discovered by any other person in this country prior to the alleged invention or discovery thereof by the applicant,or that it had been patented or described in any printed publication in this or any foreign country, or had been in public use or on sale with the applicant's consent or allowance prior to the application, if the

Commissioner shall deem it to be sufficiently useful and important, it shall be his duty to issue a patent therefor. But whenever, on such examination, it shall appear to the Commissioner that the applicant was not the original and first inventor or discoverer thereof, or that any part of that which is claimed as new had before been invented or discovered, or patented, or described in any printed publication in this or any foreign country, as aforesaid, or that the description is defective and insufficient, he shall notify the applicant thereof, giving him, briefly, such information and references as may be useful in judging of the propriety of renewing his application, or of altering his specification to embrace only that part of the invention or discovery which is new. In every such case, if the applicant shall elect to withdraw his application, relinquishing his claim to the model, he shall be entitled to receive back twenty dollars, part of the duty required by this act, on filing a notice in writing of such election in the Patent Office, a copy of which, certified by the Commissioner, shall be a sufficient warrant to the Treasurer for paying back to the said applicant the said sum of twenty dollars. But if the applicant in such case shall persist in his claim for a patent, with or without any alteration of his specification, he shall be required to make oath or affirmation anew, in manner as aforesaid. And if the specification and claim shall not have been so modified as, in the opinion of the Commissioner, shall entitle the applicant to a patent, he may, on appeal, and upon request in writing, have the decision of a board of examiners, to be composed of three disinterested persons, who shall be appointed for that purpose by the Secretary of State, one of whom at least, to be selected, if practicable and convenient, for his knowledge and skill in the particular art, manufacture, or branch of science to which the alleged invention appertains; who shall be under oath or affirmation for the faithful and impartial performance of the duty imposed upon them by said appointment. Said board shall be furnished with a certificate in writing, of the opinion and decision of the Commissioner, stating the particular grounds of his objection, and the part or parts of the invention which he considers as not entitled to be patented. And the said board shall give reasonable notice to the applicant, as well as to the Commissioner, of the time and place of their meeting, that they may have an opportunity of furnishing them with such facts and evidence as they may deem necessary to a just decision; and it shall be the duty of the Commissioner to furnish to the board of examiners such information as he may possess relative to the matter under their consideration. And on an examination and consideration of the matter by such board, it shall be in their power, or of a majority of them, to reverse the decision of the Commissioner, either in whole or in part, and their opinion being certified to the Commissioner, he shall be governed thereby in the further proceedings to be had on such application: Provided, however, That before a board shall be instituted in any such case, the applicant shall pay to the credit of the Treasury, as provided in the ninth section of this act, the sum of twenty-five dollars, and each of said persons so appointed shall be entitled to receive for his services in each case a sum not exceeding ten dollars, to be determined and paid by the Commissioner out of any moneys in his hands, which shall be in full compensation to the persons who may be so appointed, for their examination and certificate as aforesaid.
Sec . 8. And be it further enacted, That whenever an application shall be made for a patent which, in the opinion of the Commissioner, would interfere with any other patent for which an application may be pending, or with any unexpired patent which shall have been granted, it shall be the duty of the Commissioner to give notice thereof to such applicants, or patentees, as the case may be; and if either shall be dissatisfied with the decision of the Commissioner on the question of pri-

ority of right or invention, on a hearing thereof, he may appeal from

such decision, on the like terms and conditions as are provided in the

preceding section of this act; and the like proceedings shall be had,

to determine which or whether either of the applicants is entitled to

receive a patent as prayed for. But nothing in this act contained shall

be construed to deprive an original and true inventor of the right to a

patent for his invention, by reason of his having previously taken out

letters patent therefor in a foreign country, and the same having been

published, at any time within six months next preceding the filing of

his specification and drawings. And whenever the applicant shall

request it, the patent shall take date from the time of the filing of the

specification and drawings, not however exceeding six months prior to

the actual issuing of the patent; and on like request, and the payment

of the duty herein required, by any applicant, his specification and

drawings shall be filed in the secret archives of the office until he shall

furnish the model and the patent be issued, not exceeding the term of

one year, the applicant being entitled to notice of interfering applica-

tions.

Sec . 9. And be it further enacted, That before any application for

a patent shall be considered by the commissioner as aforesaid, the'appli-

cant shall pay into the Treasury of the United States, or into the Patent

Office, or into any of the deposite banks to the credit of the Treasury,

if he be a citizen of the United States, or an alien, and shall have been

resident in the United States for one year next preceding, and shall

have made oath of his intention to become a citizen thereof, the sum

of thirty dollars; if a subject of the King of Great Britain, the sum of

five hundred dollars; and all other persons the sum of three hundred

dollars; for which payment duplicate receipts shall be taken, one of

which to be filed in the office of the Treasurer. And the moneys re-

ceived into the Treasury under this act shall constitute a fund for the

payment of the salaries of the officers and clerks herein provided

for, and all other expenses of the Patent Office, and to be called the

patent fund.

Sec . 10. And be it further enacted, That where any person hath

made, or shall have made, any new invention, discovery, or improve-

ment, on account of which a patent might by virtue of this act be

granted, and such person shall die before any patent shall be granted

therefor, the right of applying for and obtaining such patent shall

devolve on the executor or administrator of such person, in trust for

the heirs at law of the deceased, in case he shall have died intestate ;

but if otherwise, then in trust for his devisees, in as full and ample

manner, and under the same conditions, limitations, and restrictions, as

the same was held, or might have been claimed or enjoyed by such

person in his or her lifetime; and when application for a patent shall be

made by such legal representatives, the oath or affirmation provided in

the sixth section of this act shall be so varied as to be applicable to

them.

Sec . 11. And be it further enacted, That every patent shall be

assignable in law, either as to the whole interest, or any undivided part

thereof, by any instrument in writing; which assignment, and also

every grant and conveyance of the exclusive right under any patent, to

make and use, and to grant to others to make and use, the thing pa-

tented within and throughout any specified part or portion of the United

States, shall be recorded in the Patent Office within three months from

the execution thereof, for which the assignee or grantee shall pay to the

Commissioner the sum of three dollars.

a citizen thereof, who shall have invented any new art, machine, or improvement thereof, and shall desire further time to mature the same, may, on paying to the credit of the Treasury, in manner as provided in the ninth section of this act, the sum of twenty dollars, file in the Patent Office a caveat, setting forth the design and purpose thereof, and its principal and distinguishing characteristics, and praying protection of his right till he shall have matured his invention; which sum of twenty dollars, in case the person filing such caveat shall afterwards take out a patent for the invention therein mentioned, shall be considered a part of the sum herein required for the same. And such caveat shall be filed in the confidential archives of the office, and preserved in secrecy. And if application shall be made by any other person within one year from the time of filing such caveat, for a patent of any invention with which it may in any respect interfere, it shall be the duty of the Commissioner to deposite the description, specifications, drawings, and model, in the confidential archives of the office, and to give notice, by mail, to the person filing the caveat, of such application, who shall, within three months after receiving the notice, if he would avail himself of the benefit of his caveat, file his description, specifications, drawings, and model; and if, in the opinion of the Commissioner, the specifications of claim interfere with each other, like proceedings may be had in all respects as are in this act provided in the case of interfering applications: Provided, however, That no opinion or decision of any board of examiners, under the provisions of this act, shall preclude any person interested in favor of or against the validity of any patent which has been or may hereafter be granted, from the right to contest the same in any judicial court in any action in which its validity may come in question.
Sec . 13. And be it further enacted, That whenever any patent which has heretofore been granted, or which shall hereafter be granted, shall be inoperative, or invalid, by reason of a defective or insufficient description or specification, or by reason of the patentee claiming in his specification as his own invention, more than he had or shall have a right to claim as new; if the error has, or shall have arisen by inadver-
tency, accident, or mistake, and without any fraudulent or deceptive intention, it shall be lawful for the Commissioner, upon the surrender to him of such patent, and the payment of the further duty of fifteen dollars, to cause a new patent to be issued to the said inventor, for the same invention, for the residue of the period then unexpired for which the original patent was granted, in accordance with the patentee's corrected description and specification. And in case of his death, or any assignment by him made of the original patent, a similar right shall vest in his executors, administrators, or assignees. And the patent, so reissued, together with the corrected description and specification, shall have the same effect and operation in law, on the trial of all actions hereafter commenced for causes subsequently accruing, as though the same had been originally filed in such corrected form, before the issuing out of the original patent. And whenever the original patentee shall be desirous of adding the description and specification of any new improvement of the original invention or discovery which shall have been invented or discovered by him subsequent to the date of his patent, he may, like proceedings being had in all respects as in the case of original applications, and on the payment of fifteen dollars, as hereinbefore provided, have the same annexed to the original description and specification; and the Commissioner shall certify, on the margin of
such annexed description and specification, the time of its being annexed and recorded; and the same shall thereafter have the same effect in law, to all intents and purposes, as though it had been embraced in the original description and specification.

Sec . 14. And be it further enacted, That whenever, in any action for damages for making, using, or selling the thing whereof the exclu-
sive right is secured by any patent heretofore granted, or by any patent which may hereafter be granted, a verdict shall be rendered for the plaintiff in such action, it shall be in the power of the court to render judgment for any sum above the amount found by such verdict as the actual damages sustained by the plaintiff, not exceeding three times the amount thereof, according to the circumstances of the case, with costs ; and such damages may be recovered by action on the case, in any court of competent jurisdiction, to be brought in the name or names of the person or persons interested, whether as patentees, assignees, or as
grantees of the exclusive right within and throughout a specified part
of the United States. Sec . 15. And be it further enacted, That the defendant in any such
action shall be permitted to plead the general issue, and to give this act and any special matter in evidence, of which notice in writing may have been given to the plaintiff or his attorney, thirty days before trial, tending to prove that the description and specification filed by plaintiff does not contain the whole truth relative to his invention or discovery, or that it contains more than is necessary to produce the described effect; which concealment or addition shall fully appear to have been made for the purpose of deceiving the public, or that the patentee was not the original and first inventor or discoverer of the thing patented,
or of a substantial and material part thereof claimed as new, or that it had been described in some public work anterior to the supposed discovery thereof by the patentee, or had been in public use, or on sale, with the consent and allowance of the patentee before his application for a patent, or that he had surreptitiously or unjustly obtained the patent for that which was in fact invented or discovered by another, who was using reasonable diligence in adapting and perfecting the same; or that the patentee, if an alien at the time the patent was granted, had failed and neglected for the space of eighteen months from the date of the patent, to put and continue on sale to the public, on reasonable terms, the invention or discovery for which the patent issued; in either of which cases judgment shall be rendered for the defendant, with costs.
And whenever the defendant relies in his defence on the fact of a previous invention, knowledge, or use of the thing patented, he shall state, in his notice of special matter, the names and places of residence of those whom he intends to prove to have possessed a prior knowledge of the thing, and where the same had been used : Provided, however, That
whenever it shall satisfactorily appear that the patentee, at the time of making his application for the patent, believed himself to be the first inventor or discoverer of the thing patented, the same shall not be held
to be void on account of the invention or discovery or any part thereof having been before known or used in any foreign country, it not appearing that the same or any substantial part thereof had before been patented or described in any printed publication. And provided, also, That whenever the plaintiff shall fail to sustain his action on the ground that in his specification of claim is embraced more than that of which he was the first inventor, if it shall appear that the defendant had used or violated any part of the invention justly and truly specified and claimed as new, it shall be in the power of the court to adjudge and award as to costs as may appear to be just and equitable.
Sec . 16. And be it further enacted, That whenever there shall be two interfering patents, or whenever a patent on application shall have
been refused on an adverse decision of a board of examiners, on the ground that the patent applied for would interfere with an unexpired patent previously granted, any person interested in any such patent,

And such adjudication, if it be in favor of the right of such applicant, shall authorize the Commissioner to issue such patent, on his filing a copy of the adjudication, and otherwise complying with the requisitions of this act. Provided, however, That no such judgment or adjudication shall affect the rights of any person except the parties to the action and those deriving title from or under them subsequent to the rendition of such judgment.

And be it further enacted, That all actions, suits, controversies, and cases arising under any law of the United States, granting or confirming to inventors the exclusive right to their inventions or discoveries, shall be originally cognizable, as well in equity as at law, by the circuit courts of the United States, or any district court having the powers and jurisdiction of a circuit court; which courts shall have power, upon bill in equity filed by any party aggrieved, in any such
case, to grant injunctions, according to the course and principles of courts of equity, to prevent the violation of the rights of any inventor as secured to him by any law of the United States, on such terms and conditions as said courts may deem reasonable: Provided, however, That from all judgments and decrees, from any such court rendered in the premises, a writ of error or appeal, as the case may require, shall lie to the Supreme Court of the United States, in the same manner and under the same circumstances as is now provided by law in other judgments and decrees of circuit courts, and in all other cases in which the court shall deem it reasonable to allow the same.
Sec . 18. And be it further enacted, That whenever any patentee of an invention or discovery shall desire an extension of his patent beyond the term of its limitation, he may make application therefor, in writing, to the Commissioner of the Patent Office, setting forth the grounds thereof; and the Commissioner shall, on the applicant's paying the sum
of forty dollars to the credit of the Treasury, as in the case of an original application for a patent, cause to be published, in one or more of the principal newspapers in the city of Washington, and in such other paper or papers as he may deem proper, published in the section
of country most interested adversely to the extension of the patent, a
notice of such application and of the time and place when and where the same will be considered, that any person may appear and show cause why the extension should not be granted. And the Secretary of State, the Commissioner of the Patent Office, and the Solicitor of the Treasury, shall constitute a board to hear and decide upon the evidence produced before them both for and against the extension, and shall sit for that purpose at the time and place designated in the published notice thereof. The patentee shall furnish to said board a statement, in
writing, under oath, of the ascertained value of the invention, and of his receipts and expenditures, sufficiently in detail to exhibit a true and
faithful account of loss and profit in any manner accruing to him from and by reason of said invention. And if, upon a hearing of the mat-
ter, it shall appear to the full and entire satisfaction of said board, having due regard to the public interest therein, that it is just and proper that the term of the patent should be extended, by reason of the

And .the benefit of such renewal shall extend to assignees and grantees of the right to use the thing patented, to the extent of their respective interest therein: Provided, however, That no extension of a patent shall be granted after the expiration of the term for which it was originally issued.
Sec . 19. And be it further enacted, That there shall be provided for the uses of said office, a library of scientific works and periodical publications, both foreign and American, calculated to facilitate the discharge of the duties hereby required of the chief officers therein, to be purchased under the direction of the Committee of the Library of Congress. And the sum of fifteen hundred dollars is hereby appropriated, for that purpose, to be paid out of the patent fund.
Sec . 20. And be it further enacted, That it shall be the duty of the Commissioner to cause to be classified and arranged, in such rooms or galleries as may be provided for that purpose, in suitable cases, when necessary for their preservation, and in such manner as shall be conducive to a beneficial and favorable display thereof, the models and specimens of compositions and of fabrics and other manufactures and works of art, patented or unpatented, which have been, or shall hereafter be deposited in said office. And said rooms or galleries shall be kept open during suitable hours for public inspection.

Sta tu te I. July 4,1836.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That from and after the
passage of this act, the executive duties now prescribed, or which may hereafter be prescribed by law, appertaining to the surveying and sale

Duties relating to public lands under supervision of the commissioner.

(a) Decisions of the courts of the United States upon land titles from the United States, and titles to the public lands:
Under the act of Congress of March 3, 1803, entitled "An act regulating the grants of land, and providing for the sale of the lands of the United States, south of the State of Tennessee," such lands only were authorized to be sold as had not been appropriated by the previous sections of the law, and certificates granted by the commissioners in pursuance thereof. A right, therefore, to a particular tract of land, derived from a donation certificate given under that law, is superior to the title of any one who purchased the same land at the public sales, unless there is some fatal infirmity in the certificate, which renders it void. Ross v. Barland et al. 1 Peters, 666.
An act of Congress requires no precise form for the donation certificate. It is sufficient if the proofs be exhibited to the court of commissioners, to satisfy them of the facts entitling the party to the certificate. It is sufficient if the consideration, to wit, the occupancy, and the quantity granted, appears. Nothing more is necessary to certify to the government the party's right, or to enable him, after it is surveyed by the proper officer, to obtain a patent. Ibid.

Pre-emption rights declared void.

Arti cle 1. It is therefore agreed that all the pre-emption rights and reservations provided for in articles 12 and 13 shall be and are hereby relinquished and declared void.

Arti cle 2. Whereas the Cherokee people have supposed that the sum of five millions of dollars fixed by the Senate in their resolution of-----day of March, 1835, as the value of the Cherokee lands and possessions east of the Mississippi river was not intended to include the amount which may be required to remove them, nor the value of certain claims which many of their people had against citizens of the United States, which suggestion has been confirmed by the opinion expressed to the War Department by some of the Senators who voted upon the question and whereas the President is willing that this subject should be referred to the Senate for their consideration and if it was not intended by the Senate that the above-mentioned sum of five millions of dollars should include the objects herein specified that in that case such further provision should be made therefor as might appear to the Senate to be just.

Allowance in Arti cle 3. It is therefore agreed that the sum of six hundred thou-

lieu of pre-emp- sand dollars shall be and the same is hereby allowed to the Cherokee

tions, &e.

people to include the expense of their removal, and all claims of every

But it is expressly understood that the subject of this article is merely referred hereby to the consideration of the Senate and if they shall approve the same then this supplement shall remain part of the treaty.

Arti cle 4. It is also understood that the provisions in article 16, for
the agency reservation is not intended to interfere with the occupant
right of any Cherokees should their improvement fall within the same. It is also understood and agreed, that the one hundred thousand dol-
lars appropriated in article 12 for the poorer class of Cherokees and
intended as a set-off to the pre-emption rights shall now be transferred from the funds of the nation and added to the general national fund of
four hundred thousand dollars so as to make said fund equal to five hundred thousand dollars.

Provisions for agency reservation not to interfere, &c.

spending in length, and one mile in depth. Sugar island, with its islets, in the river of St. Mary's. Six hundred and forty acres, at the mission of the Little Rapids. A tract commencing at the mouth of the Pississowining river, south of Point Iroquois, thence running up said stream to its forks, thence westward, in a direct line to the Red water lakes, thence across the portage to the Tacquimenon river, and down the same to its mouth, including the small islands and fishing grounds, in front of this reservation. Six hundred and forty acres, on Grand island, and two thousand acres, on the main land south of it. Two sections, on the northern extremity of Green bay, to be located by a council of the chiefs. All the locations, left indefinite by this, and the preceding articles, shall be made by the proper chiefs, under the direction of the President. It is understood that the reservation for a place of fishing and encampment, made under the treaty of St. Alary's of the 16th of June 1820, remains unaffected by this treaty.

Paj'ments to be made to the Indians.

Article Fou rt h . In consideration of the foregoing cessions, the United States engage to pay to the Ottawa and Chippewa nations, the following sums, namely. 1st. An annuity of thirty thousand dollars per annum, in specie, for twenty years; eighteen thousand dollars, to be paid to the Indians between Grand river and the Cheboigun; three thousand six hundred dollars, to the Indians on the Huron shore, between the Cheboigan and Thunder-bay river; and seven thousand four hundred dollars, to the Chippewas north of the straits, as far as the cession extends; the remaining one thousand dollars, to be invested in stock by the Treasury Department and to remain incapable of being sold, without the consent of the President and Senate, which may, however, be given, after the expiration of twenty-one years. 2nd. Five thousand dollars per annum, for the purposes of education, teachers, school-houses, and books in their own language, to be continued twenty years, and as long thereafter as Congress may appropriate for the object. 3rd. Three thousand dollars for missions, subject to the conditions mentioned in the second clause of this article. 4th. Ten thousand dollars for agricultural implements, cattle, mechanics' tools, and such other objects as the President may deem proper. 5th. Three hundred dollars per annum for vaccine matter, medicines, and the services of
physicians, to be continued while the Indians remain on their reservations. 6th. Provisions to the amount of two thousand dollars; six thousand five hundred pounds of tobacco; one hundred barrels of salt, and five hundred fish barrels, annually, for twenty years. 7th.

Article Fif th . The sum of three hundred thousand dollars shall be set apart for the payment of just debts against the said Indians. All claims for such debts shall be examined by a commissioner to be ap-
pointed by the President and Senate, who shall act under such instructions as may be given to him, by the order of the President, for the purpose of preventing the allowance of unjust claims. The investigation shall be made at Michilimackinac, and no claims shall be.,allowed, except such as were contracted by Indians living within the district of country
hereby ceded, and to citizens or residents of the United States. No claim shall be paid out of this fund unless the claimant will receive the sum allowed to him, as full payment of all debts, due to him by the said Indians. If the fund fall short of the full amount of just debts, then a ratable division shall be made. If it exceed such amount, the balance shall be paid over to the Indians, in the same manner, that annuities
are required by law to be paid.

TREATY WITH THE OTTAWAS, ETC. 1836.

493

Article Sixt h . The said Indians being desirous of making provision for their half breed relatives, and the President having determined,
that individual reservations shall not be granted, it is agreed, that in lieu thereof, the sum of one hundred and fifty thousand dollars shall be set apart as a fund for said half-breeds. No person shall be entitled to any part of said fund, unless he is of Indian descent and actually resident within the boundaries described in the first article of this treaty, nor shall any thing be allowed to any such person, who may have received any allowance at any previous Indian treaty. The following principles, shall regulate the distribution. A census shall be taken of all the men, women, and children, coming within this article. As the Indians hold in higher consideration, some of their half-breeds than others, and as there is much difference in their capacity to use and take care of property, and, consequently, in their power to aid their Indian
connexions, which furnishes a strong ground for this claim, it is, therefore, agreed, that at the council to be held upon this subject, the commissioner shall call upon the Indian chiefs to designate, if they require it, three classes of these claimants, the first of which, shall receive onehalf more than the second, and the second, double the third. Each man woman and child shall be enumerated, and an equal share, in the respective classes, shall be allowed to each. If the father is living with the family, he shall receive the shares of himself, his wife and children. If the father is dead, or separated from the family, and the mother is living with the family, she shall have her own share, and that of the children. If the father and mother are neither living with the family, or if the children are orphans, their share shall be retained till they are twenty-one years of age; provided, that such portions of it as may be
necessary may, under the direction of the President, be from time to time applied for their support. All other persons at the age of twentyone years, shall receive their shares agreeably to the proper class. Out of the said fund of one hundred and fifty thousand dollars, the sum of five thousand dollars shall be reserved to be applied, under the direction of the President, to the support of such of the poor half breeds, as may require assistance, to be expended in annual instalments for the term of ten years, commencing with the second year. Such of the halfbreeds, as may be judged incapable of making a proper use of the money, allowed them by the commissioner, shall receive the same in instalments, as the President may direct.

Provision for half-breeds,&c.

Article Seve nth . In consideration of the cessions above made, and as a further earnest of the disposition felt to do full justice to the Indians, and to further their well being, the United States engage to keep two additional blacksmith-shops, one of which, shall be located on the reservation north of Grand river, and the other at the Sault Ste. Marie. A permanent interpreter will be provided at each of these locations. It is stipulated to renew the present dilapidated shop at Michilimackinac, and to maintain a gunsmith, in addition to the present smith's establishment, and to build a dormitory for the Indians visiting the post, and
appoint a person to keep it, and supply it with fire-wood. It is also agreed, to support two farmers and assistants, and two mechanics, as the President may designate, to teach and aid the Indians, in agriculture, and the mechanic arts. The farmers and mechanics, and the dormitory, will be continued for ten years, and as long thereafter, as the President may deem this arrangement useful and necessary; but the benefits of the other stipulations of this article, shall be continued beyond the expiration of the annuities, and it is understood that the whole of this article shall stand in force, and inure to the benefit of the Indians, as long after the expiration of the twenty years as Congress may appro-
priate for the objects. 2R

Arti cle Eigh th . It is agreed, that as soon as the said Indians desire it, a deputation shall be sent to the west of the Mississippi, and to the country between Lake Superior and the Mississippi, and a suitable location shall be provided for them, among the Chippewas, if they desire it, and it can be purchased upon reasonable terms, and if not, then in
some portion of the country west of the Mississippi, which is at the disposal of the United States. Such improvements as add value to the land, hereby ceded, shall be appraised, and the amount paid to the proper Indian. But such payment shall, in no case, be assigned to, or paid to, a white man. If the church on the Cheboigan, should fall within this cession, the value shall be paid to the baud owning it.

ance of the same in this treaty; and whereas no such reservations can be permitted in carrying out the special directions of the President on
this subject, it is agreed, that, in addition to the general fund set apart for half-breed claims, in the sixth article, the sum of forty-eight thousand one hundred and forty-eight dollars shall be paid for the extinguish-
ment of this class of claims, to be divided in the following manner: To Rix Robinson, in lieu of a section of land, granted to his Indian family,

the rate of ten dollars an acre: To John A. Drew, for a tract of one section and three quarters, to his Indian family, at Cheboigan rapids, at

family at the fishing grounds, at the rate of three dollars: To John Holiday,for five sections of land to five persons of his Indian family, at the rate of one dollar and twenty-five cents; to .Eliza Cook, Sophia Biddle, and Mary Holiday, one section of land each, at two dollars and

[Note .--This treaty was ratified with the following amendments thereto, as expressed in the aforesaid resolution of the Senate:
After the word " country" in line 4 of article 2d strike out the words " the sum of
twenty-three thousand seven hundred and fifty," and insert the following words in lieu thereof--or at such other place as may be designated by the President of the United
States, the sum of twenty thousand. After the word "cents," at the end of the third paragraph of the second article, in-
sert the following words. Provided, always, That no part or portion of said debts shall be paid until the validity and justice of each of them, shall have been inquired into by the Superintendent of Indian Affairs, who shall in no instance increase the amount spe-
cified in said schedule, but who shall allow the sum specified, reject it entirely, or reduce it as upon examination and proof may appear just, and if any part of said sum is left after paying said debts so adjudged to be just, then such surplus shall be paid to the
said Indians for their own use. Strike out the fourth paragraph of the second article in the following words: " The
sum of one thousand dollars per annum having been included by the commissioner, in his proposition for the purchase of the above land (which sum was applied to the education of the Indian youth) and the said Indians having declared that they were not
desirous of applying that sum to the aforesaid purpose, and that they wished to give that amount to their friend and relation Robert Grignon, for valuable services rendered
by him to their nation, therefore, the United States do agree to pay to the said Robert
Grignon the sum of one thousand dollars, each year, during the said term of twenty years."
At the end of the second article insert the following proviso : Provided, always, That no person shall be entitled to any part of said fund, unless he is of Indian descent and
actually resident within the boundaries described in the first article of this treaty, nor
shall any thing be allowed to any such person who may have received any allowance under any previous treaty. The portions of this fund allowed by the commissioner to
those half-breeds who are orphans, or poor or incompetent to make a proper use thereof, shall be paid to them in instalments or otherwise as the President may direct.
At the end of the third article insert the following words : And in consideration of said release and relinquishment, the United States stipulate and agree that the sum of seventysix thousand dollars shall be allowed to the said Indians, and this sum shall be invested in some safe stock and the interest thereof as it accrues shall also be so vested until such time as in the judgment of the President, the income of the aggregate sum can be
usefully applied to the execution of the provisions in the said fourth article, or to some other purposes beneficial to the said Indians.]

Sept. 17, 1836. Proclamation, Feb. 15, 1837.

Art icl e 1. By the first article of the treaty of Prairie du Chien, held the fifteenth day of July eighteen hundred and thirty, with the confederated tribes of Sacks, Foxes, loways, Omahaws, Missourias, Ottoes, and Sioux, the country ceded to the United States by that treaty, is to be assigned and allotted under the direction of the President of the United
States to the tribes living thereon, or to such other tribes as the President may locate thereon for hunting and other purposes.--And whereas it is further represented to us the chiefs, warriors, and counsellors of the loways and Sack and Fox band aforesaid, to be desirable that the lands lying between the State of Missouri and the Missouri river, should be attached to and become a part of said State, and the Indian title thereto, be entirely extinguished; but that, notwithstanding, as these
lands compose a part of the country embraced by the provisions of said first article of the treaty aforesaid, the stipulations thereof will be strictly observed until the assent of the Indians interested is given to the pro-
posed measure. Now we the chiefs, warriors, and counsellors of the loways, and Mis-
souri band of Sacks and Foxes, fully understanding the subject, and well satisfied from the local position of the lands in question, that they never can be made available for Indian purposes, and that an attempt to place an Indian population on them, must inevitably lead to collisions with the citizens of the United States; and further believing that the extension of the State line in the direction indicated would have a happy effect, by presenting a natural boundary between the whites and Indians; and willing, moreover, to give the United States a renewed evidence of our attachment and friendship, do hereby for ourselves, and on behalf of our respective tribes, (having full power and authority to this effect,) forever cede, relinquish, and quit claim, to the United States, all our right, title, and interest of whatsoever nature in, and to, the lands lying between the State of Missouri and the Missouri river; and do freely and fully exonerate the United States from any guarantee; condition or limitation, expressed or implied, under the treaty of Prairie du Chien aforesaid, or otherwise, as to the entire and absolute disposition of the said lands, fully authorizing the United States to do with the same whatever shall seem expedient or necessary.
As a proof of the continued friendship and liberality of the United

CONVENTION WITH THE SAC AND FOX TRIBE.
In a convention held this twenty-seventh day of September 1836, between Henry Dodge Superintendant of Indian Affairs, and the chiefs, braves, and principal men of the Sac and Fox tribe of Indians, it has been represented, that according to the stipulations of the first article of the treaty of Prairie du Chien, of the 15th July 1830, the country thereby ceded, is "to be assigned and allotted under the direction of the President of the United States, to the tribes now living thereon, or to such other tribes as the President may locate thereon for hunting and other purposes." And, whereas, it is further represented to us, the chiefs, braves, and principal men of the tribe aforesaid, to be desirable that the lands lying between the State of Missouri and the Missouri river should be attached to, and become a part of said State, and the Indian title thereto be entirely extinguished; but that, notwithstanding, as these lands compose a part of the country embraced by the provisions of said first article of the treaty aforesaid, the stipulations thereof will be strictly observed until the assent of the Indians interested is given to the proposed measure.
Now, we the chiefs, braves, and principal men of the Sac and Fox tribes of Indians, fully understanding the subject, and well satisfied from the local position of the lands in question, that they can never be made available for Indian purposes, and that an attempt to place an Indian population on them must inevitably lead to collisions with the citizens of the United States; and further believing that the extension of the State line in the direction indicated, would have a happy effect, by presenting a natural boundary between the whites and Indians; and, willing moreover, to give the United States a renewed evidence of our attachment and friendship, do hereby, for ourselves, and on behalf of our respective tribes (having full power and authority to this effect) forever cede, relinquish, and quit claim to the United States, all our right, title, and interest of whatsoever nature in, and to, the lands lying between the State of Missouri and the Missouri river, and do freely and fully exonerate the United States from any guarantee, condition, or limitation, expressed or implied, under the treaty of Prairie du Chien aforesaid, or otherwise, as to the entire and absolute disposition of the said lands, fully authorizing the United States to do with the same whatever shall seem expedient or necessary.

CONVENTION WITH THE SAC AND FOX TRIBE.
In a convention held this twenty-seventh day of September 1836, between Henry Dodge Superintendant of Indian Affairs, and the chiefs, braves, and principal men of the Sac and Fox tribe of Indians, it has been represented, that according to the stipulations of the first article of the treaty of Prairie du Chien, of the 15th July 1830, the country thereby ceded, is "to be assigned and allotted under the direction of the President of the United States, to the tribes now living thereon, or to such other tribes as the President may locate thereon for hunting and other purposes." And, whereas, it is further represented to us, the chiefs, braves, and principal men of the tribe aforesaid, to be desirable that the lands lying between the State of Missouri and the Missouri river should be attached to, and become a part of said State, and the Indian title thereto be entirely extinguished; but that, notwithstanding, as these lands compose a part of the country embraced by the provisions of said first article of the treaty aforesaid, the stipulations thereof will be strictly observed until the assent of the Indians interested is given to the proposed measure.
Now, we the chiefs, braves, and principal men of the Sac and Fox tribes of Indians, fully understanding the subject, and well satisfied from the local position of the lands in question, that they can never be made available for Indian purposes, and that an attempt to place an Indian population on them must inevitably lead to collisions with the citizens of the United States; and further believing that the extension of the State line in the direction indicated, would have a happy effect, by presenting a natural boundary between the whites and Indians; and, willing moreover, to give the United States a renewed evidence of our attachment and friendship, do hereby, for ourselves, and on behalf of our respective tribes (having full power and authority to this effect) forever cede, relinquish, and quit claim to the United States, all our right, title, and interest of whatsoever nature in, and to, the lands lying between the State of Missouri and the Missouri river, and do freely and fully exonerate the United States from any guarantee, condition, or limitation, expressed or implied, under the treaty of Prairie du Chien aforesaid, or otherwise, as to the entire and absolute disposition of the said lands, fully authorizing the United States to do with the same whatever shall seem expedient or necessary.

Art icl e 1st. Whereas it has been represented that according to the stipulations of the first article of the treaty of Prairie du Chien of the fifteenth of July eighteen hundred and thirty, the country ceded is "to be assigned and allotted under the direction of the President of the United States to the tribes now living thereon or to such other tribes as the President may locate thereon for hunting and other purposes,''and whereas it is further represented to us the chiefs, braves and head men of the tribes aforesaid, that it is desirable that the lands lying between the State of Missouri and the Missouri river, and south of a line running due west from the northwest corner of said State until said line strikes the Missouri river, should be attached to and become a part of said State, and the Indian title thereto be entirely extinguished; but that notwithstanding, as these lands compose a part of the country embraced by the provisions of the said first article of the treaty aforesaid, the stipulations whereof will be strictly observed, until the assent of the Indians interested is given to the proposed measure. Now we the chiefs braves and principal men of the Otoes Missouries Omahaws Yankton and Santee bands of Sioux aforesaid fully understanding the subject and well satisfied from the local position of the lands in question, that they never can be made available for Indian purposes; and that an attempt to place an Indian population on them must inevitably lead to collisions with the citizens of the United States; and, further believing that the extension of the State line in the direction indicated, would have a happy effect by presenting a natural boundary between the whites and Indians; and willing moreover to give the United States a renewed evidence of our attachment and friendship; do hereby for ourselves and on behalf of our respective tribes (having full power and authority to this effect) for ever cede relinquish and quit claim to the United States all our right title and interest of whatsoever nature in and to the lands lying between the State of Missouri and the Missouri river, and south of a line running due west from the northwest corner of the State to the Missouri river, as herein before mentioned, and freely and fully exonerate the United States from any guarantee condition or limitation expressed or implied under the treaty of Prairie du Chien aforesaid or otherwise, as to the entire and absolute disposition of said lands, fully authorizing the United States to do with the same whatever shall seem expedient or necessary.

relinquishment; and as some compensation for the great sacrifice made by the several deputations at this particular season, by abandoning their fall hunts and traveling several hundred miles to attend this convention the undersigned John Dougherty and Joshua Pilcher agrees on behalf of the United States to pay as a present to the tribes herein before named the sum of four thousand five hundred and twenty dollars in
merchandize, the receipt of which they hereby acknowledge having been distributed among them in the proportions following. To the Otoes twelve hundred and fifty dollars,to the Missouries one thousand dollars to the Omahaws twelve hundred and seventy dolls.to the Yankton and Santee bands of Sioux one thousand dollars.

Portions of each tribe.

Art . 3d. In consequence of the removal of the Otoes and Missou-
ries from their former situation on the river Platte to the place selected for them, and of their having to build new habitations last spring at the
time which should have been occupied in attending to their crops, it
appears that they have failed to such a degree as to make it certain that they will lack the means of subsisting next spring, when it will be necessary for them to commence cultivating the lands now preparing for their use. It is therefore agreed that the said Otoes, and Missouries
(in addition to the presents herein before mentioned) shall be furnished at the expence of the United States with five hundred bushels of corn
to be delivered at their village in the month of April next. And the same causes operating upon the Omahaws, they having also abandoned
their former situation, and established at the place recommended to them on the Missouri river, and finding it difficult without the aid of
ploughs to cultivate land near there village where they would be secure from their enemies, it is agreed as a farther proof of the liberality of the
Government and its disposition to advance such tribes in the cultivation of the soil as may manifest a disposition to rely on it for the future
means of subsistence ; that they shall have one hundred acres of ground broke up and put under a fence near their village, so soon as it can be
done after the ratification of this convention, and that there shall be a
suitable person employed as farmer to assist and instruct them in cultivating the soil so soon and for such time as the President of the United
States may deem p*roper.

Ottoes and Missourias to be furnished with 500 bushels of corn.
Omahas to have 100 acres of ground broke up, &c.
* See note on p. 526.

* Art . 4th. The undersigned chiefs braves and head men of the
tribes herein before named, feeling sensible of the many acts of kindness and liberality manifested towards them, and their respective tribes by their good friends Joseph Roubadoux sen., and Lucien Fontenelle, during an intercourse of many years; aware of the heavy losses sustained by them at different times by their liberality in extending large
credits to them and their people, which have never been paid, and which
(owing to the impoverished situation of their country and their scanty means of living) never can be; are anxious to evince some evidence of
gratitude for such benefits and favours, and compensate the said indi-
viduals in some measure for their losses. To this end at the earnest solicitation of said tribes it is agreed that the said Joseph Roubadoux
sen. shall have the privilege of selecting three sections of land any where
within the ceded territory so soon as the same shall be surveyed, and the said Lucien Fontenelle shall be permitted to select two sections in like manner which shall be conveyed to them by the United States without cost, whenever the land so selected shall be reported by them there agents or legal representatives to the register and receiver of the land office of the district in which they lie. It is however distinctly understood that if the President and Senate of the United States should refuse to ratify this and the last preceding article or either of them or any part
thereof, that such refusal shall in no way affect the relinquishment and

With the Wahpaakootah, Susseton, and Upper Medawakanton tribes of Sioux Indians.
In a convention held this thirtieth day of November 1836 between Lawrence Taliaferro, Indian Agent at St. Peters, and the chiefs, braves, and principal men of the Wahpaakootah, Susseton, and Upper Medawakanton tribes of Sioux Indians, it has been represented, that according to the stipulations of the first article of the treaty of Prairie du Chien of the 15th July, 1830, the country thereby ceded is " to be assigned and allotted under the direction of the President of the United States to the tribes now living thereon, or to such other tribes as the President may locate thereon for hunting and other purposes." And, whereas, it is further represented to us, the chiefs, braves and principal men of the tribes aforesaid, to be desirable, that the lands lying between the State of Missouri, and the Missouri river should be attached to, and become a part of said State, and the Indian title thereto be entirely extinguished; but that, notwithstanding, as these lands compose a part of the country embraced by the provisions of said first article of the treaty aforesaid, the stipulations thereof will be strictly observed until the assent of the Indians interested is given to the proposed measure.
Now we, the chiefs, braves, and principal men of the Wahpaakootah, Susseton and Upper Medawakanton tribes of Sioux Indians, fully understanding the subject, and well satisfied from the local position of the lands in question that they can never be made available for Indian purposes, and that an attempt to place an Indian population on them must inevitably lead to collisions with the citizens of the United States; and further believing that the extension of the State line in the direction indicated, would have a happy effect, by presenting a natural boundary between the whites and Indians; and willing, moreover, to give the United States a renewed evidence of our attachment and friendship, do hereby for ourselves, and on behalf of our respective tribes (having full power and authority to this effect) forever cede, relinquish and quit claim to the United States all our right, title and interest of whatsoever nature in, and to, the lands lying between the State of Missouri, and the Missouri river, and do freely and fully exonerate the United States from any guarantee, condition, or limitation, expressed or implied, under the treaty of Prairie du Chien aforesaid, or otherwise, as to the entire and absolute disposition of the said lands, fully authorizing the United States to do with the same whatever shall seem expedient or necessary.
As a proof of the continued friendship and liberality of the United States towards the Wahpaakootah, Susseton and Upper Medawakanton tribes of Sioux Indians, and as an evidence of the sense entertained for the good will manifested by said tribes to the citizens and Government of the United States, as evinced in the preceding cession or relinquishment, the undersigned agrees, on behalf of the United States, to cause said tribes to be furnished with presents to the amount of five hundred and fifty dollars in goods,,the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged.

Favors granted to other nations shall become common.

ARTICLE II. The United States of America and the Peru-Bolivian Confederation, desiring to live in peace and harmony, as well with each other as with all the nations of the earth, by means of a policy frank, and equally friendly with all, engage, mutually, not to concede any particular favor to other nations, in respect of commerce and navigation, which shall not immediately become common to the other party to this treaty; who shall enjoy the same freely, if the concession was freely made, or on allowing the same compensation, if the concession was conditional.

Citizens placed on the footing of the most favored nation, with regard to commerce and navigation.
Coasting trade excepted.
Merchants and others free to manage their own business. Citizens of neither liable to any embargo, &c.

ARTICLE III. The two high contracting parties, being likewise desirous of placing the commerce and navigation of their respective countries on the liberal basis of perfect equality with the most favored nation, mutually agree that the citizens of each may frequent with their vessels, all the coasts and countries of the other, and may reside and trade there in all kinds of produce, manufactures, and merchandize, not prohibited to all; and shall pay no other or higher duties, charges or fees, whatsoever, either on their vessels or cargoes, than the citizens or subjects of the most favored [nation] are, or shall be, obliged to pay on their vessels and cargoes; and they shall enjoy, respectively, all the rights, privileges, and exemptions, in navigation and commerce, which the citizens or subjects of the most favored nation do or shall enjoy; they submitting themselves to the laws, decrees, and usages there established, to which such citizens or subjects are, of right, subjected. But it is understood that the stipulations contained in this article do not include the coasting trade of either of the two countries; the regulation of this trade being reserved by the parties, respectively, according to their own separate laws.
ARTICLE IV. It is likewise agreed, that it shall be wholly free for all merchants, commanders of ships, and other citizens of both countries, to manage, themselves, their own business in all the ports and places subject to the jurisdiction of the other, as well with respect to the consignment and sale of their goods and merchandize, as to the purchase of their returns, unloading, loading, and sending off of their vessels. The citizens of neither of the contracting parties shall be liable to any embargo, nor to be detained with their vessels, cargoes, merchandize, or effects, for any military expedition, nor for any public or private purpose whatever, without being allowed therefor a sufficient indemnification. Neither shall they be called upon for any forced loan, or occasional contributions ; nor be subject to military service on land or sea.

Protection to citizens ofeither party seeking

ARTICLE V. Whenever the citizens of either of the contracting parties shall be forced to seek refuge, shelter, or relief, in the rivers, bays, ports, and dominions of the other, with their vessels, whether of war, (public or

ments.

ARTICLE VII.

Whenever any vessel belonging to the citizens of either of the contracting parties shall be wrecked, founder, or suffer damage, on the coasts, or within the dominions of the other, all assistance and protection shall be given to the said vessel, her crew, and the merchandize on board, in the same manner as is usual and customary with vessels of the nation where the accident happens, in like cases; and it shall be permitted to her, if necessary, to unload the merchandize and effects on board, with the proper precautions to prevent their illicit introduction, without exacting, in this case, any duty, impost, or contribution whatever, provided the same be exported.

Vessels, &c. captured by pirates, to be restored.

And if, in the case of real estate, the said heirs should be prevented from entering into possession of the inheritance on account of their character as aliens, there shall be granted to them the term of three years in which to dispose of the same, as they may think proper, and to withdraw the proceeds, which they may do without obstacle, and exempt from all charges, save those which are imposed by the laws of the

country.

ARTICLE IX.

Both the contracting parties solemnly promise and engage to give their special protection to the persons and property of the citizens of each other, of all classes and occupations, who may be in the territories subject to the jurisdiction of the one or the other, transient or dwelling therein, leaving open and free to them the tribunals of justice, for their judicial recourse, on the same terms as are usual and customary with the natives or citizens of the country in which they may be; for which purpose they may employ, in defence of their rights, such advocates, solicitors, notaries, agents, and factors, as they may judge proper, in all their trials at law; and such citizens or agents shall have free opportunity to be present at the decisions and sentences of the tribunals, in all cases that may concern them ; and, likewise, at the taking of all evidence and examinations that may be exhibited in the said trials.

No rights of citizens to be withdrawn, until, &c.

And, to render more explicit, and make more effectual, the solemn promise and engagement herein before mentioned, under circumstances to which one of the parties thereto has heretofore been exposed, it is hereby further stipulated and declared, that all the rights and privileges which are now enjoyed by, or may hereafter be conferred on, the citizens of one of the contracting parties, by or in virtue of the constitution and laws of the other, respectively, shall be deemed and held to belong to, and inhere in, them, until such rights and privileges shall have been abrogated or withdrawn by an authority constitutionally or lawfully competent thereto.

Liberty of conscience secured. Rites of burial.

ARTICLE X. It is likewise agreed, that perfect and entire liberty of conscience shall be enjoyed, by the citizens of both the contracting parties, in the countries subject to the jurisdiction of the one and the other, without their being liable to be disturbed or molested on account of their religious belief, so long as they respect the laws and established usages of the country. Moreover, the bodies of the citizens of one of the contracting parties, who may die in the territories of the other, shall be buried in the usual burying-grounds, or in other decent and suitable places, and shall be protected from violation or disturbance.

ARTICLE XI. It shall be lawful for the citizens of the United States of America and of the Peru-Bolivian Confederation, to sail with their ships, with all manner of liberty and security; no distinction being to be made who are the proprietors of the merchandise laden therein, from any port or places whatever, to the ports and places of those who are now, or hereafter shall be, at enmity with either of the contracting parties. It shall likewise be lawful for the citizens aforesaid to sail with the ships and merchandise before mentioned, and to trade, with the same liberty and security, from the places, ports, and havens of those who are enemies of both, or of either party, without any opposition or disturbance whatsoever ; not only directly from the places of the enemy before mentioned to neutral places, but also from one place belonging to an enemy to another place belonging to an enemy, whether they be under the jurisdiction of one power, or under that of several. And it is hereby stipulated, that free ships shall give freedom to goods; and that every thing shall be deemed to be free and exempt, which shall be found on board of the ships belonging to the citizens of either of the contracting parties, although the whole lading, or any part thereof, should appertain to the enemies of either ; goods contraband of war being always excepted. It is also agreed, in like manner, that the same liberty shall be extended to persons who are on board of a free ship, with this effect, that, although they be enemies to both or either of the parties, they shall not be taken out of that free ship, unless they are officers or soldiers, and in the actual service of the enemy : Provided, however, and it is hereby further agreed, that the stipulations in this article contained, declaring that the flag shall cover the property, shall be understood as applying to those powers only who recognise this principle; but if either of the contracting parties shall be at war with a third, and the other be neutral, the flag of the neutral shall cover the property of those enemies whose Governments acknowledge this principle, and not that of others.

Qualification of the principle as to neutral property.

ARTICLE XII. It is likewise agreed, that in cases where the neutral flag of one of the contracting parties shall protect the property of the enemies of the other, in virtue of the above stipulation, it shall always be understood

CONVENTION WITH PERU-BOLIVIA. 1836.

491

that the neutral property found on board of such enemy's vessel shall be held and considered as enemy's property, and as such, shall be Hable to detention and confiscation, except such property as was put on board of such vessels before the declaration of war, or even afterwards, if it were done without the knowledge of such declaration : but the contracting parties agree, that six months having elapsed after the declaration, their citizens shall not be allowed to plead ignorance thereof. On the contrary, if the flag of the neutral does not protect the enemy's property on board; in this case, the goods and merchandise of the neutral, embarked in such enemy's ship, shall be free.

ARTICLE XIII.

This liberty of navigation and commerce shall extend to all kinds of merchandise, excepting only those which are distinguished by the name of contraband, or prohibited goods; under which name shall be comprehended, 1st, cannons, mortars, howitzers, swivels, blunderbusses, muskets, fusees, rifles, carbines, pistols, pikes, swords, sabres, lancets, spears, halberds, grenades and bombs; powder, matches, balls, and all other things belonging to the use of these arms; 2dly, bucklers, helmets, breastplates, coats of mail, infantry belts, and clothes made up in a military form, and for a military use; 3dly, cavalry belts, and horses with their furniture; 4thly, and generally, all kinds of arms and instruments of iron, steel, brass, and copper, or of any other materials manufactured, prepared, and formed expressly for the purposes of war, either by

sea or land.

ARTICLE XIV.

All other merchandise and things not comprehended in the articles of contraband, explicitly enumerated and classified as above, shall be held and considered as free, and subjects of free and lawful commerce; so that they may be carried and transported in the freest manner by both the contracting parties, even to places belonging to an enemy, excepting only those places which are, at that time, besieged or blockaded ; and to avoid all doubt in this particular, it is declared, that those places only are besieged or blockaded, which are actually attacked by a force

capable of preventing the entry of the neutral.

Liberty ofcommerce and navigation to extend to all goods except contraband.
Contraband specified.
All kinds of merchandise, except contraband, free.

ARTICLE XV. The articles of contraband, of those before enumerated and classified, which may be found in a vessel bound for an enemy's port, shall be subject to detention and confiscation; but the rest of the cargo and the ship shall be left free, that the owners may dispose of them as they see proper. No vessel, of either of the contracting parties shall be detained on the high seas, on account of having on board articles of contraband, whenever the master, captain, or supercargo of said vessel will deliver up the articles of contraband to the captor, unless, indeed, the quantity of such articles be so great, and of so large a bulk, that they cannot be received on board the capturing vessel without great inconvenience; but in this, and all other cases of just detention, the vessel detained shall be sent to the nearest convenient and safe port, for trial and judgment according to law.
ARTICLE XVI. And whereas it frequently happens that vessels sail for a port or place belonging to an enemy, without knowing that the same is besieged, blockaded or invested, it is agreed that every vessel so circumstanced may be turned away from such port or place, but shall not be detained; nor shall any part of her cargo, if not contraband, be confiscated, unless, after being warned of such blockade or investment, by the commanding officer of a vessel forming part of the blockading forces, she

Contraband goods only, liable to confiscation.
Vessels not to be detained, unless, &c.

shall again attempt to enter; but she shall be permitted to go to any other port or place the master or supercargo shall think proper. Nor shall any vessel of either party, that may have entered into such port or place, before the same was actually besieged, blockaded, or invested by the other, be restrained from quitting it, with her cargo; nor, if found therein before or after the reduction and surrender, shall such vessel, or her cargo be liable to seizure, confiscation, or any demand on the score of redemption or restitution; but the owners thereof shall be allowed to remain in the undisturbed possession of their property. And if any vessel, having thus entered the port before the blockade took place, shall take on board a cargo after the blockade be established, and attempt to depart, she shall be subject to being warned by the blockading forces to return to the port blockaded, and discharge the said cargo; and if, after receiving said warning, the vessel shall persist in going out with the cargo, she shall be liable to the same consequences to which a vessel attempting to enter a blockaded port, after being warned off by the blockading forces would be liable.
ARTICLE XVII. To prevent all kinds of disorder and irregularity in the visiting and examining of the ships and cargoes of both the contracting parties on the high seas, they have agreed, mutually, that whenever a vessel of war, public or private, shall meet with a neutral of the other contracting party, the first shall remain at the greatest distance compatible with the possibility and safety of making the visit, under the circumstances of wind and sea, and the degree of suspicion attending the vessel to be visited, and shall send one of her small boats, with no more men than those necessary to man it, for the purpose of executing the said examination of the papers concerning the ownership and cargo of the vessel, without causing the least extortion, violence, or ill-treatment; in respect of which, the commanders of said armed vessels shall be responsible, with their persons and property; for which purpose, the commanders of said private armed vessels shall, before receiving their commissions, give sufficient security to answer for all the injuries and damages they may commit. And it is expressly agreed, that the neutral party shall in no case be required to go on board the examining vessel, for the purpose of exhibiting the ship's papers, nor for any other purpose whatever.

In case of war, vessels to be provided with sea-letters.
If not so provided, may be adjudged lawful prize.

ARTICLE XVIII. To avoid all vexation and abuses in the examination of the papers relating to the ownership of the vessels belonging to the citizens of the contracting parties, they have agreed, and do agree, that, in case one of them should be engaged in war, the ships and vessels of the other must be furnished with sea-letters, or passports, expressing the name, property, and burden of the ship, as also the name and place of residence of the master or commander thereof, in order that it may thereby appear that the said ship really and truly belongs to the citizens of one of the parties. They have likewise agreed, that such ships, being laden, besides the said sea-letters or passports, shall be provided with certificates, containing the several particulars of the cargo, and the place whence the ship sailed; so that it may be known whether any contraband or prohibited goods are on board of the same: which certificates shall be made out by the officers of the place whence the ship sailed, in the accustomed form: without which requisites the said vessel may be detained, to be adjudged by the competent tribunals, and may be declared legal prize, unless the said defect shall be proved to be owing to accident, or be satisfied or supplied by testimony entirely equivalent, in the opinion of said tribunals; to which ends, there shall be allowed a sufficient term of time for its procurement.

CONVENTION WITH PERU-BOLIVIA. 1836.

493

ARTICLE XIX. And it is further agreed, that the stipulations above expressed, relative to the visiting and examining of vessels, shall apply to those only which sail without convoy ; and when said vessels shall be under convoy, the verbal declaration of the commander of the convoy, on his word of honor, that the vessels under his protection belong to the nation whose flag he carries, and, when they are bound to an enemy's port, that they have no contraband goods on board, shall be sufficient.

Vessels under convoy not subject to examina. tion.

ARTICLE XX. It is moreover agreed, that, in all cases, the established courts for prize causes, in the country to which the prize may be conducted, shall alone take cognizance of them. And whenever such tribunal or court, of either party, shall pronounce judgment against any vessel, goods, or property, claimed by citizens of the other party, the sentence or decree shall mention the reasons or motives in which the same shall have been founded; and an authenticated copy of the sentence or decree, and of all the proceedings in the case, shall, if demanded, be delivered to the commander or agent of said vessel or property, without any excuse or delay, he paying the legal fees for the same.

Prize courts only to take cognizance of prizes.

ARTICLE XXI.
Whenever one of the contracting parties shall be engaged in war with another State, no citizen of the other contracting party shall accept a commission or letter of marque, for the purpose of assisting or co-operating hostilely with the said enemy against the said party so at war, under pain of being treated as a pirate.

Citizens of neither party to engage in privateering against the other.

ARTICLE XXII.

If, at any time, a rupture should take place between the two contracting nations, and (which God forbid) they should become engaged in war with each other, they have agreed, and do agree now, for then, that the merchants, traders, and other citizens of all occupations, of each of the two parties residing in the cities, ports, and dominions of the other, shall have the privilege of remaining and continuing their trade and business therein, and shall be respected and maintained in the full and undisturbed enjoyment of their personal liberty and property, so long as they behave peaceably and properly, and commit no offence against the laws. And in case their conduct should render them suspected of malepractices, and, having thus forfeited this privilege, the respective Governments should think proper to order them to depart, the term of twelve months, from the publication or intimation of this order therefor, shall be allowed them, in which to arrange and settle their affairs, and remove with their families, effects, and property; to which end, the necessary safe conduct shall be given to them, and which shall serve as a sufficient protection until they arrive at the designated port, and there embark. But this favour shall not be extended to those who shall act contrary to the established laws. It is, nevertheless, to be understood, that the persons so suspected may be ordered, by the respective Governments, to remove forthwith into the interior, to such places as they shall think fit to designate.
ARTICLE XXIII.

In the event of war between the parties, citizens may remain, &c. If suspected of malpractices, and ordered to depart, time allowed, &c.
Exceptions.

Neither the debts due from individuals of the one nation, to the individuals of the other, nor shares, nor money, which they may have in public funds, nor in public or private banks, shall ever, in any event of war or national difference, be sequestered or confiscated.

I
ARTICLE XXIV. Both the contracting parties being desirous of avoiding all inequality in relation to their public communications and official intercourse, they have agreed, and do agree, to grant to their envoys, ministers, and other public agents, the same favors, immunities, and exemptions, as those of the most favored nation do or shall enjoy; it being understood, that whatever favors, immunities, or privileges the United States of America, or the Peru-Bolivian Confederation, may find it proper to grant to the envoys, ministers, and public agents of any other power, shall, by the same act, be granted and extended to those of the contracting parties, respectively.
ARTICLE XXV. To make more effectual the protection which the United States of America and the Peru-Bolivian Confederation, shall afford in future to the navigation and commerce of the citizens of each other, they agree to receive and admit consuls and vice-consuls, in all the ports open to foreign commerce; who shall enjoy, within their respective consular districts, all the rights, prerogatives, and immunities of the consuls and vice-consuls of the most favored nation; each contracting party, however, remaining at liberty to except those ports and places in which the admission and residence of such functionaries may not seem convenient.
ARTICLE XXVI. In order that the consuls and vice-consuls of the two contracting parties may enjoy the rights, prerogatives, and immunities which belong to them by their public character, they shall, before entering on the exercises of their functions, exhibit their commission, or patent, in due form, to the Government to which they are accredited; and, having received their exequatur, they shall be held and considered as such consuls and vice-consuls, by all the authorities, magistrates, and inhabitants in the consular district in which they reside.

ARTICLE XXVII. It is likewise agreed, that the consuls, vice-consuls, their secretaries, officers and persons attached to their service, (they not being citizens of the country in which the consul or vice-consul resides,) shall be exempt from all public service, and also from all kinds of taxes, imposts, and contributions, except those which they shall be obliged to pay on account of commerce, or their property, and from which the citizens of their respective country, resident in the other, are not exempt, in virtue of the stipulations contained in this treaty; they being, in every thing besides, subject to the laws of the respective States. The archives and papers of the consulates shall be respected inviolably, and, under no pretext whatever, shall any magistrate, or other person, seize, or in any way interfere with them.

Consuls, &c. may require the assistance of the local authorities to arrest deserters.

ARTICLE XXVIII. The said consuls and vice-consuls shall have power to require the assistance of the authorities of the country for the arrest, detention, and custody of deserters from the public and private vessels of their country; and for this purpose they shall address themselves to the courts, judges, or officers competent, and shall demand the said deserters in writing, proving, by an exhibition of the ship's roll, or other public document, that the men so demanded are part of the crew of the vessel from which

CONVENTION WITH PERU-BOLIVIA. 1836.

it is alleged they have deserted; and on this demand, so proved, (saving, however, when the contrary is more conclusively proved,) the delivery shall not be refused. Such deserters, when arrested, shall be put at the disposal of the said consuls or vice-consuls, and may be put in the public prisons, at the request and expense of those who reclaim them, to be sent to the ships to which they belong or to others of the same nation; but if they should not be so sent within two months, to be counted from the day of their arrest, they shall be set at liberty, and shall be no more arrested for the same cause.

' And it is hereby agreed between the parties, that on the expiration of one year after such notice shall have been received by either of them from the other, as above mentioned, this treaty shall, in all the points relating to commerce and navigation, altogether cease and determine; and in all those parts which relate to peace and friendship, it shall be permanently and perpetually binding on both powers.

The United States of America and the Republic of Venezuela, desiring to live in peace and harmony with all the other nations of the earth, by means of a policy frank and equally friendly with all, engage, mutually, not to grant any particular favor to other nations, in respect of commerce and navigation, which shall not immediately become common to the other party, who shall enjoy the same freely, if the concession was freely made, or on allowing the same compensation, if the concession

was conditional.

Mutual benefits in trade and residence to be enjoyed.

ARTICLE 3. The two high contracting parties being likewise desirous of placing the commerce and navigation of their respective countries on the liberal basis of perfect equallity and reciprocity, mutually agree that the citizens of each may frequent all the coasts and countries of the other, and reside and trade there in all kinds of produce, manufactures and merchandize; and they shall enjoy all the rights, privileges and exemptions, in navigation and commerce, which native citizens do, or shall enjoy, submitting
