SHORT TITLE

RandolphSheppard Act Amendments of 1974.

SEC. 200. This title may be cited as the "Randolph-Sheppard Act 20 u s e 107 note. Amendments of 1974".
FINDINGS

SEC. 201. The Congress finds-- (1) after review of the operation of the blind vending stand
program authorized under the Randolph-Sheppard Act of June 20, 1936, that the program has not developed, and has not been sustained, in the manner and spirit in which the Congress intended at the time of its enactment, and that, in fact, the growth of the program has been inhibited by a number of external forces;
(2) that the potential exists for doubling the number of blind operators on Federal and other property under the RandolphSheppard program within the next five years, provided the obstacles to growth are removed, that legislative and administrative means exist to remove such obstacles, and that Congress should adopt legislation to that end; and
(3) that at a minimum the following actions must be taken to insure the continued vitality and expansion of the RandolphSheppard program--
(A) establish uniformity of treatment of blind vendors by all Federal departments, agencies, and instrumentalities,
(B) establish guidelines for the operation of the program by State licensing agencies,
(C) require coordination among the several entities with responsibility for the program,
(D) establish a priority for vending facilities operated by blind vendors on Federal property,
(E) establish administrative and judicial procedures under which fair treatment of blind vendors, State licensing agencies, and the Federal Government is assured,
(F) require stronger administration and oversight functions in the Federal office carrying out the program, and
(G) accomplish other legislative and administrative objectives which will permit the Randolph-Sheppard program to flourish.

In the event such a ceiling is imposed, no blind licensee shall receive less vending machine income under such ceiling than he was receiving on January 1,1974. No limitation shall be imposed on income from vending machines, combined to create a vending facility, which are maintained, serviced, or operated by a blind licensee. Any amounts received by a blind licensee that are in excess of the amount permitted to accrue to him under any ceiling imposed by the Commissioner shall be disbursed to the appropriate State agency under clause (2) of this subsection and shall be used by such agency in accordance with subsection (c) of this section.

'Direct competition' as used in this section means the existence of any vending machines or facilities operated on the same premises as a blind vending facility except that vending machines or facilities operated in areas serving employees the majority of whom normally do not have direct access to the blind vending facility shall not be considered in direct competition with the blind vending facility. After January 1,1975, 50 per centum of all vending machine income from vending machines on Federal property which are not in direct competition with a blind vending facility shall accrue as specified in subsection (a) of this section, except that with respect to Federal property at which at least 50 per centum of the total hours worked on the premises occurs during periods other than normal working hours, 30 per centum of such income shall so accrue.
"(2) The head of each department, agency, and instrumentality of the United States shall insure compliance with this section with respect to buildings, installations, and facilities under his control, and shall be responsible for collection of, and accounting for, such vending machine income.

Public Law 94-13 94th Congress

An Act

To continue the national insurance development program.

Be it enacted hy the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled^ That this Act may be cited as the "National Insurance Development Act of 1975".
SECTION 1. (a) The Congress finds that (1) under the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 (Public Law 90^48, approved August 1, 1968), as amended, the powers of the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development to enter into new reinsurance contracts with respect to the Federal riot reinsurance program and into new direct insurance contracts with respect to the Federal crime insurance program will terminate on April 30,1975, except to the extent necessary (a) to continue policies of direct insurance and reinsurance, until April 30, 1978, (b) to handle claims and those arising under the policies still in force on the termination date of the program, and (c) to complete the liquidation and termination of the reinsurance and direct insurance programs; (2) continuation of the Federal riot reinsurance program is essential both to the operation of the system of State FAIR plans, which provide access for many people to basic property insurance not otherwise available in urban areas, and to the continued existence of such F A I R plans inasmuch as many State laws condition the very existence of such F A I R plans upon the continued existence of the Federal riot reinsurance program; (3) continuation of the Federal crime insurance program, which provides access for many homeowners, tenants, and small businessmen to burglary, robbery, and similar coverages, in States where an insurance coverage availability problem exists, is likewise essential; (4) withdrawal at this time of the Federal support which these programs give to the insurance buying public and the insurers would be particularly ill timed and inadvisable in view of the (a) threatening major shortage of voluntary insurance facilities to which the consumer can turn to fulfill his insurance purchase needs and (b) the potential for insurer insolvencies inherent in times of economic stress; and (5) the impending tightening of the availability of insurance coverage in the insurance market will only intensify due to the present economic conditions confronting insurers, which affect the capital adequacies of insurers due to severe declines in the values of insurers' securities portfolios, thus impacting on their ability to increase their underwritings in a growing insurance market.
(b) The purpose of this Act, therefore, is to extend the duration of the national insurance development program so as to maintain the Federal riot reinsurance program which reinsures the general property insurance business against the catastrophic peril of riot and, thus, makes this insurance available, together with its review and compliance function which assures that the intent of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 (Public Law 90-448, approved August 1, 1968) as amended is carried out, as well as the Federal crime insurance program which provides basic crime insurance coverages in the States where it is needed, both of which programs aid the insurance purchasing consumer when, from time to time and especially in times such as

PUBLIC LAW 94-13--APR. 8, 1975

89 STAT. 69

these, insurers engage in conscious policies of market constriction

which lead to serious inner-city insurance availability problems of

the kind the national insurance development program has been created

to ameliorate.

SEC. 2. Section 1201 (b) (1) of the National Housing Act is amended by striking out "April 30,1975" and inserting in lieu thereof "April 30,

1977". ^

Joint Resolution
To authorize and request the President to issue a proclamation designating the calendar week beginning May 12, 1975, as "National Historic Preservation Week".

May 9, 197;i [HJ.Res. 242]

Whereas the two hundredth anniversary of the founding of this Republic approaches; and
Whereas an indispensable element of the strength, the freedom and the constructive world leadership of this Nation is the knowledge and appreciation of our origins and history, of who we are, where we are, and how we arrived there; and
Whereas the houses where we have lived, the buildings where we have worked, the streets we have walked for more than three hundred years are as much a part of our heritage as the wisdom of the Founding Fathers and the works of art which succeeding generations of Americans have bequeathed to us; and
Whereas these buildings and places, great and humble, not only are our roots, but are also sources of pride in our past achievements and enrich our lives today; and
Whereas historic preservation today involves much more than period rooms in house museums, but means, rather, that old homes, public buildings, hotels, taverns, theaters, industrial buildings, churches, and commercial structures can be saved and put to contemporary use as living history to be treated with respect and incorporated within our planning as our towms and cities grow to provide the citizens of this Nation with an environment of quality and enduring interest: Now, therefore, be it Resolved iy the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled, That the President is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation--
(1) designating the calendar week beginning May 12, 1975, as "National Historic Preservation Week"; and
(2) urging Federal, State, and local government agencies, as well as citizens and private organizations, especially the preservation organizations, historical societies, and related groups, to observe that week with educational efforts, ceremonies, and other appropriate activities which--
(a) are designed to call public attention to the urgent need to have our historic landmarks for the enjoyment and edification of the citizens of this Nation, present and future; and
(b) will demonstrate lasting respect for this unique heritage.

" ( E ) In addition to the bases specified in subsection 25(a), a reviewing Court may set aside an order of the Commission under section 19(b) approving an exchange rule imposing a schedule or fixes lates of commissions, allowances, discounts, or other fees, if the Court finds--
"(1) a Commission determination under paragraph (4) (A) that an interested person is not entitled to conduct cross-examination or make rebuttal submissions, or
"(2) a Commission rule or ruling under paragraph (4) (B) limiting the petitioner's cross-examination or rebuttal submissions, has precluded full disclosure and proper resolution of disputed issues of material fact which were necessary for fair determination by the Commission.

"(1) any person not a member or a designated representative of a member of a national securities exchange effecting transactions on such exchange without the services of another person acting as a broker, or
"(2) any broker or dealer not a member of a national securities exchange effecting transactions on such exchange on a regular basis, to comply with such rules of such exchange as the Commission may specify.".

"(8) In addition to the fees and charges authorized by paragraph (7) of this subsection, each registered broker or dealer not a member of a registered securities association shall pay to the Commission such reasonable fees and charges as may be necessary to defray the costs of the additional regulatory duties required to be performed by the Commission because such brokei- or dealer eifects transactions in securities otherwise than on a national securities exchange of which it is a member and is not a member of a registered securities association.

" N A T I O N A L S Y S T E M FOR C L E A R A N C E A N D S E T T L E M E N T o r SECURITIES
TRANSACTIONS

"SEC. 17A. (a)(1) The Congress finds that--
"(A) The prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions, including the transfer of record ownership and the safeguarding of securities and funds related thereto, are necessary for the protection of investors and persons facilitating transactions by and acting on behalf of investors.
"(B) Inefficient procedures for clearance and settlement impose unnecessary costs on investors and persons facilitating transactions by and acting on behalf of mvesitors.
"(Cj New data processing and communications techniques create the opportunity for more efficient, effective, and safe procedures for clearance and settlement.
"(D) The linking of all clearance and settlement facilities and the development of uniform standards and procedures for clearance and settlement will reduce unnecessary costs and increase the protection of investors and persons facilitating transactions by and acting on behalf of investors. "(2) The Commission is directed, therefore, having due regard for the public interest, the protection of investors, the safeguarding of securities and funds, and maintenance of fair competition among brokers and dealers, clearing agencies, and transfer agents, to use its authority under this title to facilitate the establishment of a national system for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of transactions in securities (other than exempted securities) in accordance with the findings and to carry out the objectives set forth in paragraph (1) of this subsection. The Commission shall use its authority under this title to assure equal regulation under this title of registered clearing agencies and registered transfer agents.
"(b)(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, it shall be unlawful for any clearing agency, unless registered in accordance with this subsection, directly or indirectly, to make use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce to perform the functions of a clearing agency with respect to any security (other than an exempted security).

" (2) A clearing agency may be registered under the terms and conditions hereinafter provided in this subsection and in accordance with
the provisions of section 19 (a) of this title, by filing with the Commis-
sion an application for registration in such form as the Commission, by rule, may prescribe containing the rules of the clearing agency and such other information and documents as the Commission, by rule, may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions.

A registered clearing agency shall file notice with the Commission not less than thirty days prior to admitting any person to participation, if the clearing agency knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known, that such person was subject to a statutory disqualification.

"(C) A registered clearing agency may summarily suspend and close the accounts of a participant who (i) has been and is expelled or suspended from any self-regulatory organization, (ii) is in default of any delivery of funds or securities to the clearing agency, or (iii) is in such financial or operating difficulty that the clearing agency determines and so notifies the appropriate regulatory agency for sucn participant that such suspension and closing of accounts are necessary for the protection of the clearing agency, its participants, creditors, or investors. A participant so summarily suspended shall be promptly afforded an opportunity for a hearing by the clearing agency in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph. The appropriate regulatory agency for such participant, by order, may stay any such summary suspension on its own motion or upon application by any person aggrieved thereby, if such appropriate regulatory agency determines summarily or after notice and opportunity for hearing (which hearing may consist solely of the submission of affidavits or presentation of oral arguments) that such stay is consistent with the public interest and protection of investors.
" (6) No registered clearing agency shall prohibit or limit access by any person to services offered by any participant therein.
"(c)(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, it shall be unlawful for any transfer agent, unless registered in accordance with this section, directly or indirectly, to make use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce to perform the function of a transfer agent with respect to any security registered under section 12 of this title or which would be required to be registered except for the exemption from registration provided by subsection (g) (2) (B) or (g) (2) (G) of that section.

"(2) A transfer agent may be registered by filing with the appropriate regulatory agency for such transfer agent an application for registration in such form and containing such information and documents concerning such transfer agent as such appropriate regulatory agency may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this section. Except as hereinafter provided, such registration shall become effective thirty days after receipt of such application by such appropriate regulatory agency or within such shorter period of time as such appropriate regulatory agency may determine.

regulations thereunder. "(B) Pending final determination whether any registration by a
transfer agent under this subsection shall be denied, the appropriate regulatory agency for such transfer agent, by order, may postpone the effective date of such registi-ation for a period not to exceed fifteen days, but if, after notice and opportunity for hearing (which may consist solely of affidavits and oral arguments), it shall appear to such appropriate regulatory agency to be necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of in\ ostors to postpone the effective date of such registration until final determination, such appropriate regulatory agency shall so order. Pending final determination whether any registration under this subsection shall be revoked, such appropriate regulatory agency, by order, may suspend such registration, if such suspension appears to such appropriate regulatory agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, to be necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.
"(C) A registered transfer agent may, upon such terms and conditions as the appropriate regulatory agency for such transfer agent deems necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or in furtherance of the purposes of this section, withdraw from registration by filing a written notice of withdrawal with such appropriate regulatory agency.

For purposes of the preceding sentence, any violation of any such provision shall constitute adequate basis for the issuance of an order under section 8(b) or 8(c) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, and the participants in any such clearing agency and the persons doing business with any such transfer agent shall be deemed to be 'depositors' as that term is used in section 8 (c) of that Act.
"(3) (A) With respect to any clearing agency or transfer agent for which the Commission is not the appropriate regulatory agency, the Commission and the appropriate regulatory agency for such clearing agency or transfer agent shall consult and cooperate with each other, and, as may be appropriate, with State banking authorities having supervision over such clearing agency or transfer agent toward the end that, to the maximum extent practicable, theiir respective regulatory

PUBLIC LAW 94-29--JUNE 4, 1975

89 STAT. 159

is entered, as provided in section 2112 of title 28, United States Code, and the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.
"(3) On the filing of the petition, the court has jurisdiction, which becomes exclusive on the filing of the record, to affirm or modify and enforce or to set aside the order in whole or in part.
" (4) The findings of the Commission as to the facts, if supported by substantial evidence, are conclusive.
"(5) If either party applies to the court for leave to adduce additional evidence and shows to the satisfaction of the court that the additional evidence is material and that there was reasonable ground for failure to adduce it before the Commission, the court may remand the case to the Commission for further proceedings, in whatever manner and on whatever conditions the court considers appropriate. If the case is remanded to the Commission, it shall file in the court a supplemental record containing any new evidence, any further or modified findings, and any new order.
"(b) (1) A person adversely affected by a rule of the Commission promulgated pursuant to section 6,11, l l A , 15(c) (5) or (6), 15A, 17, 17A, or 19 of this title may obtain review of this rule in the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit in which he resides or has his principal place of business or for the District of Columbia Circuit, by filing in such court, within sixty days after the promulgation of the rule, a written petition requesting that the rule be set aside.
"(2) A copy of the petition shall be transmitted forthwith by the clerk of the court to a member of the Commission or an officer designated for that purpose.

"(4) The findings of the Commission as to the facts identified by the Commission as the basis, in whole or in part, of the rule, if supported by substantial evidence, are conclusive.

"(2) The filing of a petition under this section does not operate as a stay of the Commission's order or rule. Until the court's jurisdiction becomes exclusive, the Commission may stay its order or rule pending judicial review if it finds that justice so requires. After the filing of a petition under this section, the court, on whatever conditions may be required and to the extent necessary to prevent irreparable injury, may issue all necessary and appropriate process to stay the order or rule or to preserve status or rights pending its review; but (notwith-standing section 705 of title 5, United States Code) no such process may be issued by the court before the filing of the record or the materials set forth in subsection (b)(2) of this section unless: (A) the Commission has denied a stay or failed to grant requested relief, (B) a reasonable period has expired since the filing of an application for a stay without a decision by the Commission, or (C) there was reasonable ground for failure to apply to the Commission.

has jurisdiction w'ith respect to the order or rule to the exclusion of any other court, and thereupon all such proceedings shall be transferred to that court; but, for the convenience of the parties in the interest of justice, that court may thereafter transfer all the proceedings to any other court of appeals or district court of the United States, w^hether or not a petition for review or an action for enforcement was originally filed in the transferee court. The scope of review by a district court under section 21 (d) or (e) of this title is in all cases the same as by a court of appeals under this section.
"(d) (1) For purposes of the preceding subsections of this section, the term 'Commission' includes the agencies enumerated in section 3(a) (34) of this title insofar as such agencies are acting pursuant to this title.
"(2) For purposes of subsection (a) (4) of this section and section 706 of title 5, United States Code, an order of the Commission pursuant to section 19(a) of this title denying registration to a clearing
agency for which the Commission is not the appropriate regulatory agency or pursuant to section 19(b) of this title disapproving a proposed rule change by such a clearing agency shall be deemed to be an order of the appropriate regulatory agency for such clearing agency insofar as such order was entered by reason of a determination by such appropriate regulatory agency pursuant to section 19(a)(2)(C) or 19(b)(4)(C) of this title that such registration or proposed rule change would be inconsistent with the safeguarding of securities or funds.".

89 STAT. 161

"(c) The stay, setting aside, or modification pursuant to section 19(e) of this title of any disciplinary sanction imposed by a self-regulatory organization or a member thereof, person associated with a member, or participant therein, shall not affect the validity or force of any action taken as a result of such sanction by the self-regulatory organization prior to such stay, setting aside, or modification: Provided^ That such action is not inconsistent with the provisions of this title or the rules or regulations thereunder. The rights of any person acting in good faith which arise out of any such action shall not be affected in any way by such stay, setting aside, or modification.
"(d) N"o State or political subdivision thereof shall impose any tax on any change in beneficial or record ownership of securities effected through the facilities of a registered clearing agency or registered transfer agent or any nominee thereof or custodian therefor or upon the delivery or transfer of securities to or through or receipt from such agency or agent or any nominee thereof or custodian therefor, unless such change is beneficial or record ownership or such transfer or delivery or receipt would otherwise be taxable by such State or political subdivision if the facilities of such registered clearing agency, registered transfer agent, or any nominee thereof or custodian therefor were not physically located in the taxing State or political subdivision. No State or political subdivision thereof shall impose any tax on securities which are deposited in or retained by a registered clearing agency, registered transfer agent, or any nominee thereof or custodian therefor, unless such securities would otherwise be taxable by such State or political subdivision if the facilities of such registered clearing agency, registered transfer agent, or any nominee thereof or custodian therefor were not physically located in the taxing State or political subdivision.
"(e)(1) No person using the mails, or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, in the exercise of investment discretion with respect to an account shall be deemed to have acted unlawfully or to have breached a fiduciary duty under State or Federal law unless expressly provided to the contrary by a law enacted by the Congress or any State subsequent to the date of enactment of the Securities Acts Amendments in 1975 solely by reason of his having caused the account to pay a member of an exchange, broker, or dealer an amount of commission for effecting a securities transaction in excess of the amount of commission another member of an exchange, broker, or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction, if such person determined in good faith that such amount of commission was reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such member, broker, or dealer, viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or his overall responsibilities with respect to the accounts as to which he exercises investment discretion. This subsection is exclusive and plenary insofar as conduct is covered by the foregoing, unless otherwise expressly provided by contract: Provided^ however, That nothing in this subsection shall be construed to impair or limit the power of the Commission under any other provision of this title or otherwise.
"(2) A person exercising investment discretion with respect to an account shall make such disclosure of his policies and practices with respect to commissions that will be paid for effecting securities transactions, at such times and in such mannei-, as the appropriate regulatory agency, by rule, may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE

12 USC 2701 note.

SEC. 102. (a) The Congress finds that-- (1) the Nation is in a severe recession and that the sharp down-
turn in economic activity has driven large numbers of workers into unemployment and has reduced the incomes of many others;
(2) as a result of these adverse economic conditions the capacity of many homeowners to continue to make mortgage payments has deteriorated and may further deteriorate in the months ahead, leading to the possibility of widespread mortgage foreclosures and distress sales of homes; and
(3) many of these homeowners could retain their homes with temporary financial assistance until economic conditions improve. (b) It is the purpose of this title to provide a standby authority which will prevent widespread mortgage foreclosures and distress sales of homes i-esulting from the temporary loss of employment ajid income through a program of emergency loans and advances and emergency mortgage relief payments to homeowners to defray mortgage expenses.
MORTGA(}ES ELIGIBLE FOR ASSISTANCE

12 USC 2701.

SEC. 103. No assistance shall be extended with respect to any mortgage under this title unless--
(1) the holder of the mortgage has indicated to the mortgagor its intention to foreclose;
(2) the mortgagor and holder of the mortgage have indicated in writing to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (hereinafter referred to as the "Secretary") and to any agency or department of the Federal Government responsible for the regulation of the holder that circumstances (such as the volume of delinquent loans in its portfolio) make it probable that there will be a foreclosure and that the mortgagor is in need of emergency mortgage relief as authorized by this title, except that

12 USC 2702.

89 STAT. 250

PUBLIC LAW 94-50--JULY 2, 1975

(3) payments under the mortgage have been delinquent for at least three months;
(4) the mortgagor has incurred a substantial reduction in income as a result of involuntary unemployment or underemployment due to adverse economic conditions and is financially unable to make full mortgage payments;
(5) there is a reasonable prospect that the mortgagor will be able to make the adjustments necessary for a full resumption of mortgage payments; and
(6) the mortgaged property is the principal residence of the mortgagor.
LIMITS OF ASSISTANCE

(b) Assistance under this title on behalf of a homeowner may be made available in an amount up to the amount of the principal, interest, taxes, ground rents, hazard insurance, and mortgage insurance premiums due under the homeowner's mortgage, but such assistance shall not exceed the lesser of $250 per month or the amount determined to be reasonably necessary to supplement such amount as the homeowner is capable of contributing toAvard such mortgage payment.

(d) Emergency loans or advances of credit made and insured under section 105, and emergency mortgage relief payments made under section 106, shall be repayable by the homeowner upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary shall prescribe, except that interest on a loan or advance of credit insured under section 105 or emergency mortgage relief payments made under section 106 shall not be charged at a rate which exceeds the maximum interest rate applicable with respect to mortgages insured pursuant to section 203(b) of the National Housing Act.
(e) The Secretary may provide for the deferral of the commencement of the repayment of a loan or advance insured under section 105 or emergency mortgage relief payments made under section 106 until one year following the date of the last disbursement of the proceeds of the loan or advance or payments or for such longer period as the Secretary determines would further the purpose of this title. The Secretary shall by regulation require such security for the repayment of insured loans or advances of credit or emergency mortgage relief payments as he deems appropriate and may require that such repayment be secured by a lien on the mortgaged property.

TITLE III--COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH CENTERS
SEC. 301. This title may be cited as the "Community Mental Health Centers Amendments of 1975".
SEC. 302. (a) The Congress finds that--
(1) community mental health care is the most effective and humane form of care for a majority of mentally ill individuals;
(2) the federally funded community mental health centers have had a major impact on the improvement of mental health care by-
(A) fostering coordination and cooperation between various agencies responsible for mental health care which in turn has resulted in a decrease in overlapping services and more efficient utilization of available resources,
(B) bringing comprehensive community mental health care to all in need within a specific geographic area regardless of ability to pay, and
(C) developing a system of care which insures continuity of care for all patients, and thus are a national resource to which all Americans should enjoy access; and

PUBLIC LAW 94-63--JULY 29, 1975

89 STAT. 309

(3) there is currently a shortage and maldistribution of quality community health care resources in the United States.
(b) The Congress further declares that Federal funds should continue to be made available for the purposes of initiating new and continuing existing community mental health centers and initiating new services within existing centers, and for- the monitoring of the performance of all federally funded centers to insure their responsiveness to community needs and national goals relating to community mental health care.

Robert E. Lee. Citizenship restored posthumously, u s e prec. title 1.

Public Law 94-67
94th Congress
Joint Resolution
To restore posthumously full rights of citizenship to General R. E. Lee.
Whereas this entire Nation has long recognized the outstanding virtues of courage, patriotism, and selfless devotion to duty of General R. E. Lee, and has recognized the contribution of General Lee in healing the wounds of the War Between the States, and
Whereas, in order to further the goal of reunion of this country, General Lee, on June 13, 1865, applied to the President for amnesty and pardon and restoration of his rights as a citizen, and
Whereas this request was favorably endorsed by General Ulysses S. Grant on June 16,1865, and
Whereas, General Lee's full citizenship was not restored to him subsequent to his request of June 13, 1865, for the reason that no accompanying oath of allegiance was submitted, and
Whereas, on October 12, 1870, General Lee died, still denied the right to hold any office and other rights of citizenship, and
Whereas a recent discovery has revealed that General Lee did in fact on October 2, 1865, swear allegiance to the Constitution of the United States and to the Union, and
Whereas it appears that General Lee thus fulfilled all of the legal as well as moral requirements incumbent upon him for restoration of his citizenship: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved hy the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress a^sembled^ That, in accordance with section 3 of amendment 14 of the United States Constitution, the legal disabilities placed upon General Lee as a result of his service as General of the Army of Northern Virginia are removed, and that General R. E. Lee is posthumously restored to the full rights of citizenship, effective June 13, 1865.

SEC. 202. Section 4(b) of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is amended by adding at the end of the first paragraph thereof the following: "On and after August 6, 1975, in addition to any State or political subdivision of a State determined to be subject to subsection (a) pursuant to the previous two sentences, the provisions of subsection (a) shall apply in any State or any political subdivision of a State which (i) the Attorney General determines maintained on November 1,1972, any test or device, and with respect to which (ii) the Director of the Census determines that less than 50 per centum of the citizens of voting age were registered on November 1, 1972, or that less than 50 per centum of such persons voted in the Presidential election of November 1972.".
SEC. 203. Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is aniended by adding the following new subsection:
"(f)(1) The Congress finds that voting discrimination against citizens of language minorities is pervasive and national in scope. Such minority citizens are from environments in which the dominant language is other than English. In addition they have been denied equal educational opportunities by State and local governments, resulting in severe disabilities and continuing illiteracy in the English language. The Congress further finds that, where State and local officials conduct elections only in English, language minority citizens are excluded from participating in the electoral process. In many areas of the country, this exclusion is aggravated by acts of physical, economic, and political intimidation. The Congress declares that, in order to enforce the guarantees of the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments to the United States Constitution, it is necessary to eliminate such discrimination by prohibiting English-only elections, and by prescribing other remedial devices.
"(2) No voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure shall be imposed or applied by any State or political subdivision to deny or abridge the right of any citizen of the United States to vote because he is a member of a language minority group.
"(3) In addition to the meaning given the term under section 4(c), the term 'test or device' shall also mean any practice or requirement by which any State or political subdivision provided any registration or voting notices, forms, instructions, assistance, or other materials or information relating to the electoral process, including ballots, only in the English language, where the Director of the Census determines that more than five per centum of the citizens of voting age residing

SEC. 204. Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is amended by inserting after "November 1, 1968," the following: "or whenever a State or political subdivision with respect to which the prohibitions set forth in section 4(a) based upon determinations made under the third sentence of section 4(b) are in effect shall enact or seek to administer any voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting different from that in force or effect on November 1, 1972,".

"(b) Prior to August 6,1985, no State or political subdivision shall provide registration or voting notices, forms, instructions, assistance, or other materials or information relating to the electoral process, including ballots, only in the English language if the Director of the Census determines (i) that more than 5 percent of the citizens of voting age of such State or political subdivision are members of a single language minority and (ii) that the illiteracy rate of such persons as a group is higher t h a n the national illiteracy r a t e : Provided^ T h a t the prohibitions of this subsection shall not apply in any political subdivision which has less than five percent voting age citizens of each language minority which comprises over five percent of the statewide population of voting age citizens. F o r purposes of this subsection, illiteracy means the failure to complete the fifth primary grade. Thy determinations of the Director of the Census under this subsection shall be effective upon publication in the Federal Register and shall not be subject to review in any court.
"(c) Whenever any State or political subdivision subject to the prohibition of subsection (b) of this section provides any registration or voting notices, forms, instructions, assistance, or other materials or information relating to the electoral process, including ballots, it shall provide them in the language of the applicable minority group as well as in the English l a n g u a g e : Provided, T h a t where the language of the applicable minority group is oral or unwritten or in the case of Alaskan natives, if the predominant language is historically unwritten, the State or political subdivision is only required to furnish oral instiructions, assistance, or other information relating to registration and voting.
"(d) Any State or political subdivision subject to the prohibition of subsection (b) of this section, which seeks to provide English-only registration or voting materials or information, including ballots, may file an action against the United States in the United States District Court for a declaratory judgment permitting such provision. The court shaU grant the requested relief if it determines that the illiteracy rate of the applicable language minority group within the State or political subdivision is equal to or less than the national illiteracy rate.
"(e) For purposes of this section, the term 'language minorities' or 'language minority group' means persons who are American Indian, Asian American, Alaskan Natives, or of Spanish heritage."

Authorizing and requesting the President to issue a proclamation designating Sunday, September 14, 1975, as "National Saint Elizabeth Seton Day".

Sept. 11, 1975 [SJ. Res. 125]

Whereas Elizabeth Seton, who was born in New York City on August 28,1T74, and who died in Emmitsbur^, Maryland, on January 8, 1821, who was the founder of the first religious order for women in the United States and who also established the first Catholic parish school in the United States, will be canonized and proclaimed to be a saint on September 14,1975, at official ceremonies in Saint Peter's Basilica in Kome, thus becoming the first person born in what is now the United States to be so recognized; and
Whereas Elizabeth Seton, who will then be known as Saint Elizabeth Seton, through her own life and work and through the work of thousands of women who traced the origins of their religious foundations to her founding of the Sisters of Charity of Saint Joseph of Emmitsburg, Maryland, on July 31, 1809, made an extraordinary contribution to the religious and moral life of our country as well as to the education, health, and welfare of vast numbers of our citizens: Now, therefore, be it

Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled^ That the President is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation designating Sunday, September 14, 1975, as "National Saint Elizabeth Seton Day" and calling upon the people of the United States and interested groups and organizations to observe that day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.

94th Congress
Joint Resolution
Asking the President of the United States to declare the fourth Saturday of September 1975 as "National Hunting and Fishing Day".
Whereas in the congestion and the complexities, the tensions and frustrations of today's life, the need for outdoor recreation--the opportunity to "get away from it all"--has become of crucial importan(?e; and
Whereas there are few pursuits providing a better chance for healthy exercise, peaceful solitude, and appreciation of the great outdoors than hunting and fishing; and
Whereas this is evident in the fact that more than fifteen million hunting licenses and twenty-four million fishing licenses were issued in 1970; and
Whereas this income provides a rich source of funds for fish and wildlife conservation and management and for the salvation, preservation, and propagation of vanishing species; and
Whereas hunters and anglere traditionally have led in the effort to preserve our natural resources; and
Whereas outdoor sportsmen also have led in the promotion of proper respect for private as well as public property, of courtesy in the field and forest, and in boating and firearm safetj^ programs; and
Whereas there is no present national recognition of the many and worthwhile contributions of the American hunter and angler: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved hy the Senate and House of Representatwes of the United States of America in Congress assembled^ That the President of the United States declare the fourth Saturday of September 1975, as "National Hunting and Fishing Day" to provide that deserved national recognition, to recognize the esthetic, health, and recreational virtues of hunting and fishing, to dramatize the continued need for gun and boat safety, and to rededicate ourselves to the conservation and respectful use of our wildlife and natural resources.

SPECIAL SUPPLEMENTAL, FOOD PROGRAM
SEC. 14. Effective beginning with the fiscal year ending June 30, 1976, section 17 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 is revised to read as follows:
u SPECIAL SUPPLEMENTAL FOOD PROGRAM
"SEC. 17. (a) The Congress finds that substantial numbers of pregnant women, infants, and young children are at special risk in respect to their physical and mental health by reason of poor or inadequate nutrition or health care, or both. It is, therefore, the purpose of the program authorized by this section to provide supplemental nutritijous food as an adjunct to good health care during such critical times of growth and development in order to prevent the occurrence of health problems.
"(b)(1) During the fiscal year ending June 30, 1976, the period July 1, 1976, through September 30, 1976, the fiscal year ending September 30, 1977, and the fiscal year ending September 30, 1978, the Secretary shall make cash grants to the health department or comparable agency of each State, Indian tribe, band or group recognized by the Department of the Interior; or the Indian Health Service of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare for the purpose of providing funds to local health or welfare agencies or private nonprofit agencies of such State; Indian tribe, band, or group reco^ized by the Department of the Interior; or the Indian Health Service of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, serving local health or welfare needs to enable such agencies to carry out health and nutrition programs under which supplemental foods will be made available to pregnant or lactating women and to infants determined by competent professionals to be nutritional risks because of inade-

PUBLIC LAW 94-105--OCT. 7, 1975

89 STAT. 519

quate nutrition and inadequate income, in order to improve their health status. The program authorized by this section shall be carried out supplementary to the food stamp and food distribution program and operate side by side with existing supplemental food programs.
"(2) Any eligible local health or welfare agency or private nonprofit agency that applies to operate such a supplemental food program immediately shall be provided with the necessary funds to carry out the program. The requirements set forth herein shall not be construed to permit the Secretary to reduce ratably the amount of foods that an eligible health or welfare agency shall distribute under the program to pregnant or lactating mothers and infants.
"(c) In order to carry out such program during each fiscal year during the period ending September 30, 1977, there is authorized to be appropriated the sum of $250,000,000, but in the event that such sum has not been appropriated for such purpose by the beginning of each fiscal year, the Secretary shall use $250,000,000, or, if any amount has been appropriated for such program, the difference, if any, between the amount directly appropriated for such purpose and $250,000,000, out of funds appropriated by section 32 of the Act of August 24,1935 (7 U.S.C. 612c). Any funds expended from such section 32 to carry out the provisions of this section shall be reimbursed out of any supplemental appropriation hereafter enacted for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of such subsection, and such reimbursements shall be deposited into the fund established pursuant to such section 32, to be available for the purpose of such section. In order to carry out the program during the fiscal year ending September 30, 1978, there is authorized to be appropriated not to exceed $250,000,000.
"(d) Whenever any program is carried out by the Secretary under authority of this section through any State or local or nonprofit agency, he is authorized to pay administrative costs not to exceed 20 per centum of the program funds provided to each State under the authority of this section. Each health department or comparable agency of each State, Indian tribe, band, or group recognized by the Department of the Interior; or the Indian Health Service of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare receiving funds from the Secretary under this section shall, by January 1 of each year (by December 1 in the case of fiscal year 1976), for approval by the Secretary as a prerequisite to receipt of funds under this section, submit a description of the manner in which administrative funds shall be spent, including, but not limited to, a description of the manner in which nutrition education services will be provided. The Secretary shall take affirmative action to insure that programs begin in areas most in need of special supplemental food. During the first 3 months of any program, or until the program reaches its projected caseload level, whichever comes first, the Secretary shall pay those administrative costs necessary to commence the program successfully.
"(e) The eligibility of persons to participate in the program provided for under this section shall be determined by competent professional authority. Participants shall be residents of areas or members of populations served by clinics or other health facilities determined to have significant numbers of infants and pregnant and lactating women at nutritional risk.
"(f) State or local agencies or groups carrying out any programs under this section shall maintain adequate medical records on the participants assisted to enable the Secretary to determine and evaluate the benefits of the nutritional assistance provided under this section. The Secretary shall convene an advisory committee made up of rep-

Such term may also include (at the discretion of the Secretary) any commercially formulated preparation specifically designed for women or infants. The contents of the food package shall be made available in such a manner as to provide flexibility, taking into account medical and nutritional objectives and cultural eating patterns.
"(4) 'Competent professional authority' includes physicians, nutritionists, registered nurses, dietitians, or State or local medically

In those States in which the Secretary administers the nonfood assistance program in nonprofit private schools, the Secretary shall, for the fiscal year ending June 30,1976, withhold from the funds apportioned to any such State under this subsection an amount which bears the same ratio to such funds as the number of children enrolled in nonprofit private schools without a food service program in such State bears to the total number of children enrolled in all schools without a food service program in such State. In those States in which the Secretary administers the nonfood assistance program in nonprofit private schools, the Secretary shall, after the fiscal year ending June 30, 1976, withhold from the funds apportioned to any such State under this subsection an amount which bears the same ratio to such funds as the number of children enrolled in nonprofit private schools without a food service program or without the facilities to prepare or receive hot meals in such State bears to the total number of children enrolled in all schools without a food service program or without the facilities to prepare or receive hot meals in such State. The funds so reserved, apportioned, and withheld shall be used by State educational agencies, or the Secretary in the case of nonprofit private schools, only to assist schools without a food service program and schools without the facilities to prepare or receive hot meals. If any State cannot so utilize all the funds apportioned to it under the provisions of this subsection, the Secretary shall make further apportionments to the remaining States for use only in assisting schools without a food service program and schools without the facilities to prepare or receive hot meals: Provided, That if after such further apportionments any funds reserved under this subsection remain unused, the Secretary shall immediately apportion such funds among the States in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of this section to assist schools with a food service program and with the facilities to prepare or receive hot meals. Payment to any State of the funds provided to it under the provisions of this subsection shall be made upon the condition that at least one-fourth of the cost of the equipment financed shall be borne by funds from sources within the State, except that such condition shall not apply with respect to funds used under this subsection to assist schools which are especially needy, as determined by the State."

Citizens and nationals of the United States and corporations organized or ope'-ating within the United States enjoy the benefits of the United States flag and the protection of the Armed Forces and owe allegiance to the United States. It is the purpose of this section to provide a remedy for discrimination by citizens or nationals of the United States or corporations organized or operating within the United States, and by organizations controlled by them, against the Department of Defense in the supply of petroleum products.

PUBLIC LAW 94-106--OCT. 7, 1975

89 STAT. 541

subsection (e) (2) of this section) in the supply, either within or out-

side the United States, of petroleum products for the Armed Forces

of the United States.

that there has been discrimination, shall immediately refer the mat-

ter to the Attorney General of the United States who shall immedi-

ately institute an investigation.

with jurisdiction to prevent and restrain discrimination prohibited by

subsection (b) (1) of this section; and it shall be the duty of the several

United States attorneys, in their respective districts, under the direc-

tion of the Attorney General, to institute proceedings to prevent and

restrain such discrimination. Such proceedings may be by way of peti-

tions setting forth the case and requesting that the discrimination be

enjoined or otherwise prohibited. Pending such petition and before

final decree, the court may at any time make such temporary restrain-

ing order or prohibition as it determines appropriate under the cir-

cumstances of the case.

,

(2) Whenever it shall appear to the court before which any pro-

ceeding under paragraph (1) of this subsection may be pending, that

the ends of justice require that other parties should be brought before

the court, the court may cause them to be summoned, whether they

reside in the district in which the court is held or not; and subpenas

to that end may be served in any district by the marshal thereof.

(3) Any proceeding under paragraph (1) of th^s subsection against

any corporation may be brought not only in the judicial district in

which it is incorporated, but also in any district in which it may be

found or transacts business; and all process in such cases may be served

in the district in which it is incorporated, or wherever it may be found.

(4) In any proceeding brought in any district court of the United

States pursuant to this section, the Attorney General may file with the

clerk of such court a certificate of the Secretary of Defense that, in his

opinion, the proceeding is of critical importance to the effective opera-

tion of the Armed Forces of the United States and that immediate

relief from the discrimination is necessary, a copy of which shall be

immediately furnished by such clerk to the chief judge of the circuit

(or, in his absence, the presiding circuit judge) in which the proceed-

ing is pending. Upon receipt of the copy of such certificate, it shall be

the duty of the chief judge of the circuit or the presiding circuit judge,

as the case may be, to designate immediately three judges in such cir-

cuit, of whom at least one shall be a circuit judge, to hear and deter-

mine such proceeding. Except as to causes which the court considers

to be of greater urgency, proceedings before any district court under

this section shall take precedence over all other causes and shall be

assigned for hearing and trial at the earliest practicable date and

expedited in every way.

(5) In every proceeding brought in any district court of the United

States under this section, an appeal from the final order of the district

court will be only to the Supreme Court.

(d) (1) For the purpose of any inves'^igation instituted by the

Attorney General pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, he, or his

designee, shall at all reasonable times (A) have access to the premises

or property of, (B) haA'e access to and the right to copy the books,

159); or under the provisions of any other authority, on terms not inconsistent with the applicable Armed Services Procurement Regulations, as amended from time to time, and at prices which are fair and reasonable and do not exceed prices received for similar products and quantities from other domestic or foreign customers. Disagreements as to price or other terms or conditions shall be disputes as to questions of fact to be resolved in the manner prescribed by the applicable Armed Services Procurement Regulations, as amended from time to time, for the settlement of disputes arising out of contracts and shall not be a basis for delay or refusal to supply petroleum products.

Joint Resolution
rp^ implement the United States proposal for the early-warning system in Sinai.
Whereas an agreement signed on September 4, 1975, by the Government of the A r a b Republic of E g y p t and the Government of Israel may, when it enters into force, constitute a significant step toward peace in the Middle East;
Whereas the President of the United States on September 1, 1975, transmitted to the Government of the Arab Republic of E g y p t and to the Government of Israel identical proposals for United States participation in an early-warning system, the text of which has been submitted to the Congress, providing for the assignment of no more than two hundred United States civilian personnel to carry out certain specified noncombat functions and setting forth the terms and conditions thereof;
Whereas that proposal would permit the Government of the United States to withdraw such personnel if it concludes that their safety is jeopardized or that continuation of their role is no longer necessary; and
Whereas the implementation of the United States proposal for the early-warning system in Sinai may enhance the prospect of compliance in good faith Avith the terms of the E g y p t i a n - I s r a e l i agreements and thereby promote the cause of peace: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved hy the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, T h a t t h e President is authorized to implement the "United States Proposal for the Early W a r n i n g System in S i n a i " : Provided, however, T h a t U n i t e d States civilian personnel assigned to Sinai under such proposal shall be removed immediately in the event of an outbreak of hostilities between E g y p t and Israel or if the Congress by concurrent resolution determines that the safety of such personnel is jeopardized or that continuation of their role is no longer necessary. Nothing contained in this resolution shall be construed as granting any authority to the President with respect to the introduction of United States Armed Forces into hostilities or into situations wherein involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances which authority he would not have had in the absence of this joint resolution.
SEC. 2. A n y concurrent resolution of t h e t y p e described i n the first section of this resolution which is introduced in either House of Congress shall be privileged in the same manner and to the same extent as a concurrent resolution of the type described in section 5(c) of Public Law 93-148 is privileged under section 7 of such law.
SEC. 3. The United States civilian personnel participating in the early warning system in Sinai shall include only individuals who have volunteered to participate in such system.
SEC. 4. Whenever United States civilian personnel, pursuant to this resolution, participate in an early warning system, the President shall, so long as the participation of such personnel continues, submit written reports to the Congress periodically, but no less frequently than once

An Act

To amend title 38, United States Code, to provide special pay and incentive pay for certain physicians and dentists employed by the Department of Medicine and Surgery of the Veterans' Administration in order to enhance the recruitment and retention of such personnel, and for other purposes.

89 STAT. 669
Oct. 22, 1975 [H.R. 8240]

Be it enacted hy the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assemhled^ T h a t this Act m a y be cited as the "Veterans' Administration Physician and Dentist Pay Comparability Act of 1975".
SEC. 2. (a) The Congress hereby finds and declares (1) that the ceiling: on the salary of physicians employed in the Department of Medicine and Surgery due to the Federal salary limitation under the Executive Schedule rates of pay in title 5, United States Code, accompanied by the sharp escalation in the cost of living since those rates of pay were last increased in 1969, has seriously impaired the recruitment and retention of qualified physicians by the Department of Medicine and Surgery in the Veterans' Administration; and (2) that the compensation provided to physicians and dentists in the Department of Medicine and Surgery has been rendered noncompetitive by virtue of the payment of special pay of up to $13,500 per annum, in addition to basic compensation and other benefits, to certain medical officers, and monthly special and continuation pay cumulating approximately half such amount to certain dental officers, of the uniformed services, pursuant to title 37 of the United States Code and Public Law 93-274. The Congress further finds and declares t h a t these recruitment and retention difficulties have created an inequitable and demoralizing situation in the Department of Medicine and Surgery that threatens to erode seriously the ability of the Department to compete for the services of necessary health care professionals and thereby to continue to provide quality health care to eligible veterans.
(b) Section 4i07 of title 38, United States Code, is amended by-- (1) striking out the comma and "other than Chief Medical
Director and Deputy Chief Medical Director," after "title" in the first sentence of subsection ( a ) ;
(2) striking out in subsection (a) the following: "Associate Deputy Chief Medical Director, at the annual rate provided in section 5316 of title 5 of the United States Code for positions in level V of the Executive Schedule. "Assistant Chief Medical Director, $41,734. "Medical Director, $36,103 minimum to $40,915 maximum." and inserting in lieu thereof the following: "Chief Medical Director, $54,000.

TITLE I--FINDINGS, PURPOSE, AND POLICY; DEFINITIONS

National Productivity and Quality of Working Life Act of 1975.
15 u s e 2401 note.

SEC. 101. The Congress finds that-- (1) the rate of productivity growth in the United States has
declined during four of the past six years; (2) the decline in the rate of productivity growth has con-
tributed to inflation, to economic stagnation, and to increasing unemployment;
(3) since 1965, the rate of productivity growth of the United States has been consistently lower than that of many industrial nations in the world, adversely affecting the competitive position of the United States in world markets;
(I) growth in productivity of the economy of the United States is essential to the social and economic welfare of the American people, and to the health of the world economy;
(5) growth in the productivity of the Nation's economy is essential to maintain and increase employment, to stabilize the cost of living and to provide job security;
(6) mounting worldwide material shortages and their consequent inflationary results make increased efficiency in the utilization of these resources of urgent importance;
(7) sharing the fruits of productivity gains among labor, management, and owners may considerably influence productivity;
(8) the continued development of joint labor-management efforts to provide a healthy environment for collective bargaining can make a significant contribution to improve productivity and foster industrial peace;
(9) factors affecting the growth of productivity in the economy include not only the status of technology and the techniques of management but also the role of the worker in the production process and the conditions of his working life;
(10) there is a national need to identify and encourage appropriate application of capital in sectors of American economic activity in order to improve productivity;
(II) there is a national need to identify and encourage appropriate application of technology in all sectors of American economic activity in order to improve productivity;

15 u s e 2401.

89 STAT. 734

PUBLIC LAW 94-136--NOV. 28, 1975

(12) there is a national need to identify and encourage the development of social, economic, scientific, business, labor, and governmental contributions to improve productivity growth, and increased economic effectiveness in the public and private sectors of the United States; which objectives can best be accomplished through maximizing private sector and State and local development of such contributions;
(13) there is a national need to identify, study, and revise or eliminate the laws, regulations, policies, and procedures which adversely affect productivity growth and the efficient functioning of the economy;
(14) there is a national need to increase employment security through such activities as manpower planning, skill-training and retraining of workers, internal work force adjustments to avoid worker displacement, assistance to workers facing or experiencing displacement, and all other public and private programs which seek to minimize the human costs of productivity improvement, thereby diminishing resistance to workplace change and improving productivity growth;
(15) there is a national need to develop new technologies for the more effective production of goods and services;
(16) there is a national need to encourage and support efforts by qualified institutions of higher learning to identify and inaugurate programs which will improve productivity;
(17) there is a national need to develop precise, standardized measurements of productivity; and
(18) there is a national need to gather and disseminate information about methods and techniques to improve productivity.

"(7) The agency shall, subject to applicable law, promptly furnish the grievant any agency record which the grievant requests to substantiate his grievance and which the board determines is relevant and material to the proceeding. When deemed appropriate by the board, a grievant may be supplied with only a summary or extract of classified material.
"(8) Notwithstanding paragraphs (6) and (7), nothing in this Act shall be construed to require the disclosure of any official agency record to the board or a grievant where the head of agency or his deputy determines in writing that such disclosure would adversely affect the foreign policy or national security of the United States.
" (9) The agencies shall use their best endeavors to expedite security clearances whenever necessary to insure a fair and prompt investigation and hearing.
"(10) During any hearings held by the board, any oral or documentary evidence may be received but the board shall exclude any irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence as determined under section 556 of title 5 of the United States Code.

"(11) If the board determines that the agency is considering any action of the character of separation or termination of the grievant, disciplinary action against the grievant, or recovery from the grievant of alleged overpayment of salary, expenses, or allowances, which is related to a grievance pending before the board, and that such action should be suspended, the agency shall suspend such action until the board has ruled upon such grievance. Other matters not specified in this paragraph may be made subject to suspension of action by the procedures established by agreement under paragraph (1).

"(12) Upon completion of the hearing or the compilation of such record as the board may find appropriate in the absence of a hearing, the board shall expeditiously decide the grievance on the basis of the record of proceedings. In each case the decision of the board shall be in writing, shall include findings of fact, and shall include the reasons for the board's decision. The grievant shall have access to the record of proceedings including the decision.
"(13) If the board finds that the grievance is meritorious, the board shall have authority, within the limitations of the authority of the head of the agency, to direct the agency (A) to correct any official personnel record relating to the grievant which the board finds to be inaccurate or falsely prejudicial; (B) to reverse an administrative decision denying the grievant compensation or any other perquisite of employment authorized by law or regulation when the board finds that such denial was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law or regulation; (C) to retain in service an employee whose termination would be in consequence of the matter by which the employee is aggrieved; (D) to reinstate with back pay, under applicable law and regulations, an employee where it is clearly established that the separation or suspension without pay of the employee was unjustified or unwarranted; and (E) to take such other remedial action as may be provided in the procedures agreed pursuant to paragraph (1). Such orders of the board shall be final, subject to judicial review as provided in section 694, except that reinstatement of former officers who have filed grievances under paragraph (1) (D) shall be presented as board recommendations, the decision on which shall be subject to the sole discretion of the agency head or his designee who shall take into account the needs of the Service in deciding on such recommendations, and shall not be reviewable under section 694.
"(14) If the board finds that the grievance is meritorious and that remedial action should be taken that directly relates to promotion or assignment of the grievant or to other remedial action not provided in paragraph (13), or if the board finds that the evidence before it warrants disciplinary action against any officer or employee, it shall make an appropriate reconnnendation to the head of the agency, and forward to the liead of the agency the record of the board's proceedings including the transcript of the hearing if any. The head of the agency (or his designee, who shall not have direct responsibility for administrative management) shall make a written decision on the board's recommendation. A recommendation of the board may be rejected in part or in toto if the action recommended would be contrary to law, would adversely affect the foreign policy or security of the United States, or would substantially impair the efficiency of the Service. If the decision rejects the recommendation in part or in toto, the decision shall state specifically any and all reasons for such action. Pending the decision, there shall be no ex parte communication concerning the grievance between the agency head (or his designee) and any person involved in the grievance proceeding.
"(15) The board shall have authority to insure that no copy of the determination of the agency head or his designee to reject a board recommendation, no notation of the failure of the board to find for the grievant, and no notation that a proceeding is pending or has been held, shall be entered in the personnel records of the grievant (unless by order of the grievance board as a remedy for the grievance) or any other officer or employee connected with the grievance. Nothing contained herein shall prevent the agency from maintaining grievance records under appropriate safeguards to preserve confidentiality.

of land-grant universities in the United States by Federal, State, and county governments has led to agricultural progress in this country;
"(2) that land-grant and other universities in the United States have demonstrated over many years their ability to cooperate with foreign agricultural institutions in expanding indigenous food production for both domestic and international markets;
"(3) that, in a world of growing population with rising expectations, increased food production and improved distribution, storage, and marketing in the developing countries is necessary not only to prevent hunger but to build the economic base for growth, and moreover, that the greatest potential for increasing world food supplies is in the developing countries where the gap between food need and food supply is the greatest and current yields are lowest;
"(4) that increasing and making more secure the supply of food is of greatest benefit to the poorest majority in the developing world;
" (5) that research, teaching, and extension activities, and appropriate institutional development therefor are prime factors in increasing agricultural production abroad (as well as in the United States) and in improving food distribution, storage, and marketing ;
"(6) moreover, that agricultural research abroad has in the past and will continue in the future to provide benefits for agriculture in the United States and that increasing the availability of food of higher nutritional quality is of benefit to all; and

cases to continue, their efforts to assist in increasing agricultural production in developing countries. "(b) Accordingly, the Congress declares that, in order to prevent famine and establish freedom from hunger, various components must be brought together in order to increase world food production, including--
"(1) strengthening the capabilities of universities to assist in increasing agricultural production in developing countries;
"(2) institution-building programs for development of national and regional agricultural research and extension capacities in developing countries which need assistance ;
"(3) international agricultural research centers; " (4) contract research; and "(5) research program grants. "(c) The United States should--

PUBLIC LAW 94-163--DEC. 22, 1975

89 STAT. 903

Federal Register, a review of average fuel economy standards under this part. The review required to be transmitted not later than January 15, 1979, shall include a comprehensive analysis of the program, required by this part. Such analysis shall include an assessment of the ability of manufacturers to meet the average fuel economy standard for model year 1985 as specified in paragraph (1) of this subsection, and any legislative recommendations the Secretary or the EPA Administrator may have for improving the pi'ogram required by this part.
"(3) Not later than July 1, 1977, the Secretary shall prescribe, by rule, average fuel economy standards for passenger automobiles manufactured in each of the model years 1981 through 1984. Any such standard shall apply to each manufacturer (except as provided in subsection (c)), and shall be set for each such model year at a level which the /Secretary determines (A) is the maximum feasible average fuel economy level, and (B) will result in steady progress toward meeting the average fuel economy standard established by or pursuant to this subsection for model year 1985.
"(4) The Secretary may, by rule, amend the average fuel economy standard specified in paragraph (1) for model year 1985, or for any subsequent model year, to a level which he determines is the maximum feasible average fuel economy level for such model year, except that any amendment which has the effect of increasing an average fuel economy standard to a level in excess of 27.5 miles per gallon, or of decreasing any such standard to a level below 26.0 miles per gallon, shall be submitted to the Congress in accordance with section 551 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, and shall not take effect if either House of the Congress disapproves such amendment in accordance with the procedures specified in such section.
"(5) For purposes of considering any modification which is submitted to the Congress under paragraph (4), the 5 calendar days specified in section 551(f) (4) (A) of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act shall be lengthened to 20 calendar days, and the 15 calendar days specified in section 551 (c) and (d) of such Act shall be lengthened to 60 calendar days.
"(b) The Secretary shall, by rule, prescribe average fuel economy standards for automobiles which are not passenger automobiles and which are manufactured by any manufacturer in each model year which begins more than 30 months a,fter the date of enactment of this title. Such rules may proxdde for separate standards for different classes of such automobiles (as determined by the Secretary''), and shall be set at a level which the Secretary determines is the maximum feasible average fuel economy level which such manufacturers are able to achieve in each model year to which this subsection applies. Any standard applicable to a model year under this subsection shall be prescribed at least 18 months prior to the beginning of such model year.
"(c) On application of a manufacturer who manufactured (whether or not in the United States) fewer than 10,000 passenger automobiles in the second model year preceding the model year for which the application is made, the Secretary may, by rule, exempt such manufacturer from subsection (a). An application for such an exemption shall be submitted to the Secretary, and shall contain such information as the Secretary may require by rule. Such exemption may only be granted if the Secretary determines that the average fuel economy standard otherwise applicable under subsection (a) is more stringent than the maximum feasible average fuel economy level which such manufacturer can attain. The Secretary may not issue exemptions with respect to a model year unless he establishes, by rule, alternative average fuel economy standards for passenger automobiles manufactured by manu-

facturers which receive exemptions under this subsection. Such standards may be established for an individual manufacturer, for all automobiles to which this subsection applies, or for such classes of such automobiles as the Secretary may define by rule. Each such standard shall be set at a level which the Secretary determines is the maximum feasible average fuel economy level for the manufacturers to which the standard applies. An exemption under this subsection shall apply to a model year only if the manufacturer manfactures (whether or not in the United States) fewer than 10,000 passenger automobiles in such model year.
"(d) (1) Any manufacturer may apply to the Secretary for modification of an average fuel economy standard applicable under subsection (a) to such manufacturer for model year 1978, 1979, or 1980. Such application shall contain such information as the Secretary may require by rule, and shall be submitted to the Secretary within 24 months before the beginning of the model year for which such modification is requested.
"(2) (A) If a manufacturer demonstrates and the Secretary finds that--
"(i) a Federal standards fuel economy reduction is likely to exist for such manufacturer for the model year to which the application relates, and
"(ii) such manufacturer applied a reasonably selected technology, the Secretary shall, by rule, reduce the average fuel economy standard applicable under subsection (a) to such manufacturer by the amount of such manufacturer's Federal standards fuel economy reduction, rounded off to the nearest one-tenth mile per gallon (in accordance with rules of the Secretary). To the maximum extent practicable, prior to making a finding under this paragraph with respect to an application, the Secretary shall request, and the EPA Administrator shall supply, test results collected pursuant to section 503(d) of this Act for all automobiles covered by such application.
"(B) (i) If the Secretary does not find that a Federal standards fuel economy reduction is likely to exist for a manufacturer who filed an application under paragraph (1), he shall deny the application of such manufacturer.
" (ii) If the Secretary--
" ( I ) finds that a Federal standards fuel economy reduction is likely to exist for a manufacturer who filed an application under paragraph (1),and
" ( I I ) does not find that svich manufacturer applied a reasonably selected technology, the average fuel economy standard applicable under subsection (a) to such manufacturer shall, by rule, be reduced by an amount equal to the Federal standards fuel economy reduction which the Secretary finds would have resulted from the application of a reasonably selected technology. "(3) For purposes of this subsection:
"(A) The term 'reasonably selected technology' means a technology which the Secretary determines it was reasonable for a manufacturer to select, considering (i) the Nation's need to improve the fuel economy of its automobiles, and (ii) the energy savings, economic costs, and lead-time requirements associated with alternative technologies practicably available to such manufacturer.

"DETERMINATION OF AVERAGE FUEL ECONOMY
"SEC. 503. (a)(1) Average fuel economy for purposes of section
502 (a) and (c) shall be calculated by the E P A Administrator by dividing--
"(A) the total number of passenger automobiles manufactured in a given model year by a manufacturer, by
"(B) a sum of terms, each term of which is a fraction created by dividing--
" (i) the number of passenger automobiles of a given model type manufactured by such manufacturer in such model year, by
"(ii) the fuel economy measured for such model type. "(2) Average fuel economy for purposes of section 502(b) shall be calculated in accordance with rules of the E P A Administrator. "(b)(1) In calculating average fuel economy under subsection ( a ) ( 1 ) , the E P A Administrator shall separate the total number of passenger automobiles manufactured by a manufacturer into the following two categories:
"(A) Passenger automobiles which are domestically manufactured by such manufacturer (plus, in the case of model year 1978 and model year 1979, passenger automobiles which are within the includable base import volume of such manufacturer).
"(B) Passenger automobiles which are not domestically manufactured by such manufacturer (and which, in the case of model year 1978 and model year 1979, are not within the includable base import volume of such manufacturer). The E P A Administrator shall calculate the average fuel economy of each such separate category, and each such category shall be treated as if manufactured by a separate manufacturer for purposes of this part. " (2) For purposes of this subsection:
"(A) The term 'includable base import volume', with respect to any manufacturer in model year 1978 or 1979, as the case may be, is a number of passenger automobiles which is the lesser of--
"(i) the manufacturer's base import volume, or "(ii) the number of passenger automobiles calculated by multiplying--
" ( I ) the q^uotient obtained by dividing such manufacturer's base import volume by such manufacturer's base base production volume, times
" ( I I ) the total number of passenger automobiles manufactured by such manufacturer during such model year. "(B) The term 'base import volume' means one-half the sum of--
" (i) the total number of passenger automobiles which were not domestically manufactured by such manufacturer during model year 1974 and which were imported by such manufacturer during such model year, plus
" (ii) 133 percent of the total number of passenger automobiles which were not domestically manufactured by such manufacturer during the first 9 months of model year 1975 and which were imported by such manufacturer during such 9-month period. "(C) The term 'base production volume' means one-half the sum of--

PUBLIC LAW 94-163--DEC. 22, 1975

89 STAT. 907

"(i) the total number of passenger automobiles manufactured by such manufacturer during model year 1974, plus
"(ii) 133 percent of the total number of passenger automobiles manufactured by such manufacturer during the first 9 months of model year 1975. "(D) For purposes of subparagraphs (B) and (C) of this paragraph any passenger automobile imported during model year 1976, but prior to July 1,1975, shall be deemed to have been manufactured (and imported) during the first 9 months of model year 1975.
" ( E ) An automobile shall be considered domestically manufactured in any model year if at least 75 percent of the cost to the manufacturer of such automobile is attributable to value added in the LTnited States or Canada, unless the assembly of such automobile is completed in Canada and such automobile is not imported into the United States prior to the expiration of 30 days following the end of such model year. The EPA Administrator may prescribe rules for purposes of carrying out this subparagraph.
" ( F ) The fuel economy of each passenger automobile which is imported by a manufacturer in model year 1978 or 1979, as the case may be, and which is not domestically manufactured by such manufacturer, shall be deemed to be equal to the average fuel economy of all such passenger automobiles. "(c) Any reference in this part to automobiles manufactured by a manufacturer shall be deemed--
"(1) to include all automobiles manufactured by persons who control, are controlled by, or are under common control with, such manufacturer; and
"(2) to exclude all automobiles manufactured (within the meaning of paragraph (1)) during a model year by such manufacturer which are exported prior to the expiration of 30 days following the end of such model year. "(d) (1) Fuel economy for any model type shall be measured, and average fuel economy of a manufacturer shall be calculated, in accordance with testing and calculation procedures established by the E P A Administrator, by rule. Procedures so established with respect to passenger automobiles (other than for purposes of section 506) shall be the procedures utilized by the E P A Administrator for model year 1975 (weighed 55 percent urban cycle, and 45 percent highway cycle), or procedures which yield comparable results. Procedures under this subsection, to the extent practicable, shall require that fuel economy tests be conducted in conjunction w^ith emissions tests conducted under section 206 of the Clean Air Act. The EPA Administrator shall report any measurements of fuel economy and any calculations of average fuel economy to the Secretary.
"(2) 'The EPA Administrator shall, by rule, determine that quantity of any other fuel which is the equivalent of one gallon of gasoline.
" (3) Testing and calculation procedures applicable to a model year, and any amendment to such procedures (other than a technical or clerical amendment), shall be promulgated not less than 12 months prior to the model year to which such procedures apply.
"(e) For purposes of this part (other than section 506), any measurement of fuel economy of a model type, and any calculation of average fuel economy of a manufacturer, shall be rounded off to the nearest one-tenth mile per gallon (in accordance with rules of the E P A Administrator).
"(f) The EPA Administrator shall consult and coordinate with the Secretary in carrying out his duties under this section.

"(b) (1) The regulation under section 4:(a), as amended pursuant to subsection (a) of this section or by any subsequent amendment thereto, may, subject to the limitations related to the maximum weighted average first sale price and other requirements of this section, provide for different ceiling prices (or manner of determining ceiling prices) for different classifications of crude oil produced in the United States. In providing for different ceiling prices (or the manner for determining such ceiling prices) and classifications for such crude oil, the President shall determine that such ceiling prices (or the manner for determining such ceiling prices) and such classifications--
" (A) are administratively feasible; and
"(B) are justified on the basis that such prices and such classifications are consistent with obtaining optimum production of crude oil in the United States. " (2) No amendment to the regulation under section 4(a) made after the date of enactment of this section may permit, in any month which begins after such date, an increase in the price for any volume of old crude oil production from any priorities, unless the President finds that such amendment--
"(A) will give positive incentives for (i) enhanced recovery techniques, or (ii) deep horizon development, from such properties; or
"(B) is necessary to take into account declining production from such properties; and
"(C) is likely to result in a level of production from such properties beyond that which would otherwise occur if no such amendment were made. "(3) As used in paragraph (2), the term 'old crude oil production' means that volume of crude oil produced and sold from a property in a month which is equal to or less than the volume of old crude oil, as defined in section 212.72 of title 10, Code of Federal Regulations (as in effect on November 1, 1975), produced and sold from such property in the months of September, October, and November of 1975, divided by 3.

crude oil specified in subsection (a) as may be adjusted pursuant to this section.
"(2) If the President finds, pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, that the regulation under section 4(a), as amended, resulted in an actual weighted average first sale price in excess of the maximum weighted average first sale price specified in subsection (a) as adjusted pursuant to this section, he shall amend the regulation to make such compensating adjustments as are necessary to result, in a corresponding period, in an actual weighted average first sale price for domestic crude oil sufficient to offset such excess.
"(3) If the President finds, pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, that the regulation under section 4(a), as amended, resulted in an actual weighted average first sale price less than the maximum weighted average first sale price specified in subsection (a) as adjusted pursuant to this section, he may, notwithstanding the requirements of this section pertaining to such maximum weighted average firet sale price, amend the regulation to make such compensating adjustments in the regulation as are necessary to offset the deficiency in a corresponding period.
"(d)(1) The amendment promulgated pursuant to subsection (a) of this section (or any subsequent amendment to the regulation under section 4(a)) may provide for an adjustment to the maximum weighted average first sale price specified in subsection (a), such adjustment to begin no earlier than in the calendar month following the first month the amendment is in effect--
" (A) to take into account the impact of inflation as measured by the adjusted GNP deflator; and
"(B) as a production incentive; except that any adjustment as a production incentive shall not permit an increase in the maximum weighted average first sale price in excess of 3 per centum per annum (compounded annually), unless modified pursuant to this section, and the combined effect of any such adjustments referred to in subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall not result in an increase in the maximum weighted average first sale price in excess of 10 per centum per annum (compounded annually), unless modified pursuant to this section.
"(2) As used in this subsection, the term 'adjusted GNP deflator' means the first revision of the quarterly percent change, seasonally adjusted at annual rates, of the most recent implicit price deflator for the gross national product which shall be computed and published for each calendar quarter by the Department of Commerce, subject to such additional modification as the President shall make to exclude therefrom any amount which he determines is attributable solely and directly to increases which occur after the date of enactment of this section in prices of imported crude oil, residual fuel oil, or any refined petroleum product resulting from concerted action of two or more petroleum exporting countries.
"(3) The adjustment as a production incentive referred to in paragraph (1) (B) may be made only on a finding by the President that such an adjustment is likely to provide positive incentive for--
"(A) the discovery or development of high cost and high risk properties (including new wildcat properties, and properties located on the Outer Continental Shelf, properties located north of the Arctic Circle, deep wells and deep horizons in onshore or offshore properties, and properties operated by independent producers) ;

" (2) The President may submit with such report to the Congress, in accordance with the procedures specified in section 551 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, an amendment to the regulation promulgated under section 4(a) which--
" (A) provides for the continuation or modification of the adjustment as a production incentive (referred to in subsection (d) as may have been amended pursuant to subsection ( e ) ) ;
"(B) provides for a modification of the combined adjustment limitation (referred to in subsection (d), as may have been amended pursuant to subsection ( e ) ) ; or

"(4) If any such amendment is disapproved by either House of Congress, the President may, not later than 30 days after the date of such disapproval, submit one additional amendment in accordance with paragraph (2), which amendment shall not take effect if either House of Congress disapproves such amendment in accordance with the procedures specified in section 551 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act.
"(5) If no amendment to continue or modify the adjustment as a production incentive takes effect, no such adjustment to the maximum weighted average first sale price thereafter may be taken into account in computing such price for any month which begins after (A) the date on which a submission could have been made under para-
f isapproved and no further submission pursuant to paragraph (4) raph (2) but was not, or (B) the last date on which a submission was

could be made, except that the President may, pursuant to the procedures under subsection (e), submit an amendment to the regulation to provide for a prospective reinstatement of such adjustment or of a modification of such adjustment.
"(g) (1) On April 15, 1977, the President shall submit to the Congress a report as to whether the regulation promulgated under section 4(a) and in effect on such date will provide positive price incentives for the development of the domestic crude oil production referred to in paragraph (2) (A) without lessening needed incentives for sustaining or enhancing crude oil production in the remainder of the United States.
"(2) If the President determines that a price required to provide positive price incentives for the development of the domestic crude oil production referred to in paragraph (2) (A) would, because of the maximum weighted average first sale price specified in subsection (a) of this section, as adjusted, have the effect of reducing or limiting ceiling prices permitted for crude oil produced in the remainder of the United States to levels which would result in less production of such crude oil than would otherwise occur, the President may, together with such report, or at any time thereafter not earlier than 90 days after any previous submission under this subsection, except as provided in paragraph (4), submit to the Congress in accordance with the procedures specified in section 551 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act an amendment to the regulation promulgated under section 4(a) which--
" (A) excludes up to 2 million barrels a day of crude oil production transported through the trans-Alaska pipeline from the computation of the maximum weighted average first sale price specified in subsection ( a ) ; and
"(B) establishes ceiling prices (or a manner of determining prices) for the first sale of crude oil production referred to in subparagraph (A) such that the actual weighted average first sale price for such production will not exceed the highest actual weighted average first sale price permitted under the regulation for significant volumes of any other classification of domestic crude oil.

(2) Although the use of metric measurement standards in the United States has been authorized by law since 1866 (Act of July 28, 1866; 14 Stat. 339), this Nation today is the only industrially developed nation which has not established a national policy of committing itself and taking steps to facilitate conversion to the metric system.

(2) "engineering standard" means a standard which prescribes (A) a concise set of conditions and requirements that must be satisfied by a material, product, process, procedure, convention, or test method; and (B) the physical, functional, performance and/or conformance characteristics thereof;
(3) "international standard or recommendation" means an engineering standard or recommendation which is (A) formulated and promulgated by an international organization and (B) recommended for adoption by individual nations as a national standard; and
(4) "metric system of measurement" means the International System of Units as established by the General Conference of Weights and Measures in 1960 and as interpreted or modified for the United States by the Secretary of Commerce.
SEC. 5, (a) There is established, in accordance with this section, an independent instrumentality to be known as a United States Metric Board.
(b) The Board shall consist of 17 individuals, as follows:
(1) the Chairman, a qualified individual who shall be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate;

"(b) The Congress further finds and declares that while substantial progress has been made toward achieving the foregoing purposes, especially with respect to the provision of essential public facilities, much remains to be accomplished, especially with respect to the provision of essential health, education, and other public services. The Congress recognizes that changes and evolving national purposes in the decade since 1965 affect not only the Appalachian region, but also its relationship to a nation now assigning higher priority to conservation and the quality of life, values long cherished within the region. Appalachia now has the opportunity, in accommodating future growth and development, to demonstrate local leadership and coordinated planning so that housing, public services, transportation and other community facilities will be provided in a way congenial to the traditions and beauty of the region and compatible with conservation values and an enhanced quality of life for the people of the region. The Congress recognizes also that fundamental changes are occurring in national energy requirements and production, which not only risk short-term dislocations but will undoubtedly result in major long-term effects in the region. It is essential that the opportunities for expanded energy production be used so as to maximize the social and economic benefits and minimize social and environmental costs to the region and its people. It is, therefore, also the purpose of this Act to provide a framework for coordinating Federal, State and local efforts toward (1) anticipating the effects of alternative energy policies and practices, (2) planning for accompanying growth and change so as to maximize the social and economic benefits and minimize social and environmental costs, and (3) implementing programs and projects carried out in the region by Federal, State, and local governmental agencies so as to better meet the special problems generated in the region by the Nation's energy needs and policies, including problems of transportation, housing, commimity facilities, and human services.".

Report to Con-
gress

Wliereas article I, section 8, of the Constitution provides that Congress
shall have the money power, namely "to coin money and regrilate the value thereof"; Whereas Congress established the Federal Reserve Board as its agent, and delegated to its agent the day-to-day responsibility for managing the money supply; Whereas the United States economy is now suffering from excessively high unemployment and a decline in production and the gross national product, together with inflation; and Whereas the economy's performance in part is affected by changes in the rate of growth of the monetary and credit aggregates: Now, therefore, be it Resolved by the House of Representatives {the Senate concurring)^ That it is the sense of Congress that the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System and the Federal Open Market Committee--

March of Dimes Birth Defects Prevention Month, 1975

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

The nation's most precious resource is our children. Each year, however, about 150,000 babies born alive in this country have some kind of birth defect. In the first year of life, birth defects are a leading cause of death.
Today, more than 1,500 genetic defects have been cataloged, and new defects are being described in increzising numbers. Some of these are pre-existing defects from parent to child, some are caused by factors in the environment such as radiation exposure, drugs, chemicals and infections, while the cause of others is still unknown.
Discovery that a baby has a birth defect is devastating to parents. In some families, however, the probability that a specific birth defect will occur can be predicted with some accuracy.
Some defects can be diagnosed before, at, or shortly after birth. Almost as many are discovered during the first year of life. A few do not become evident until years later. Some defects can be corrected during the earliest months of life, but others unfortunately result in life-long handicaps and are irreversible. Some defects are severe and some are so mild that they can be overcome with specialized medical management.
Birth defects occur in families in every social, economic, racial, and educational level. The problems presented by these defects today are different than they were 10 years ago. Damage caused to an unborn infant by the German measles virus can virtually be eliminated with the use of the German measles vaccine. Further reductions in other birth defects can be made using knowledge already available. Good prenatal care from the earliest weeks of pregnancy, or, better yet, even before pregnancy, can help protect the pregnant woman and her unborn child from potential factors known to cause these tragic defects. In addition, new information about genetics and the effects of drugs taken by a

89 STAT. 1222

PROCLAMATION 4339--DEC. 30, 1974

pregnant woman upon the developing child is being used to prevent these disorders.
Prevention is far better than a cure. It is very fitting, therefore, that the efforts be recognized of medical researchers and practitioners throughout the country, other health professionals, and voluntary organizations working so hard toward achieving this goal of prevention.

By joint resolution, the Congress authorized and requested that the President annually designate the month of January as March of Dimes Birth Defects Prevention Month. Only through a joint effort by government and the public it serves can we continue to improve the health of our most precious resource.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GERALD R. FORD, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate January 1975 as March of Dimes Birth Defects Prevention Month.

I invite the Governors of the States and appropriate local government officials to support March of Dimes Birth Defects Prevention Month activities and I call upon the nation's mass communications media to join in encouraging all Americans to heed the message of March of Dimes Birth Defects Prevention Month--prevention of birth defects before they occur.
I urge everyone: government officials at all levels--national, state, and local--voluntary organizations, and private groups everywhere, to give special attention to these efforts for the continuing prevention of birth defects and to helping those who are afflicted.
I urge that citizens of this country fight against birth defects and particularly emphasize to all mothers the importance of maintaining good health by seeking medical care during the childbearing years.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of December, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and seventy-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-ninth.

National Jaycee Week, 1975

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
To lead and to serve are the twin ideals of the United States Jaycees. By bringing together outstanding young members of communities throughout America, the Jaycees provide a reservoir and a forum for potential national leaders; by directing their energy and skills to a wide variety of humanitarian projects, the Jaycees serve our country and mankind.
For more than half a century, the United States Jaycees have strengthened our life as a democratic society. They belong to a cherished tradition going back to our country's very beginnings when community leaders from throughout the 13 colonies--many of them young men like the Jaycees--banded together with vision and talent to forge a free nation.
Today, in more than 7,000 chapters in each of the 50 states and the Nation's capital, some 300,000 Jaycees serve this time-honored ideal in a modern setting, dedicating their free time to faith, brotherhood, freedom and the service of their fellow man.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, GERALD R. FORD, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning January 19, 1975, as National Jaycee Week--a time for the expression of America's gratitude for the many significant contributions of the United States Jaycees.
IN WITNESS W H E R E O F , I have hereunto set my hand this twentysecond day of January, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventyfive, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-ninth.

National MIA Awareness Day

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
January 27, 1975, marks the second anniversary of the signing of the Paris Agreement ending United States combat involvement in Vietnam. Although the Agreement contains specific obligations on accounting for the missing and the return of the remains of the dead, -the communist authorities have failed either to provide this information or to follow through on the return of the remains of our dead. Over 2400 Americans are still unaccounted for--some 900 of them still listed as missing, the remainder declared dead with their bodies never recovered. The families of these men continue to live with the anguish of uncertainty about the ultimate fate of these loved ones.

National Poison Prevention Week, 1975

15 u s e 1471 note.
36 u s e 165.

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
The future of America is in our children. For 13 years, National Poison Prevention Week has been an annual landmark in the ongoing campaign to protect the young children, our country's greatest resource, from the tragedies of childhood poisonings.
The average American home contains a growing variety of laborsaving devices, chemical products, and medicines. We can be proud of the skill and initiative that have made this progress possible. Yet, every thoughtful citizen must be aware that these household products and drugs which ease our daily life, in many instances, are potentially poisonous if used unwisely or stored so carelessly that small children can get to them.
Our challenge as educators, as parents, and as citizens is to strive to reduce the toll of childhood poisoning through adequate programs of public education and information. These programs should develop an awareness of the potential danger associated with many products in the home environment.
Since 1970, the Poison Prevention Packaging Act has contributed substantially to reducing the number of harmful accidental intakes and subsequent injuries and fatalities among children under five. Poisoning reports for aspirin, the product most frequently involved in childhood intake and deaths, have shown a marked decrease since requirements were established under the Act for child-resistant packaging. In order to give further recognition and emphasis to the need to reduce this tragic toll, the Congress has by a joint resolution of September 26, 1961 (75 Stat. 681), requested that the President of the United States annually issue a Proclamation declaring the third week in March as National Poison Prevention Week,
NOW T H E R E F O R E , I, GERALD R. FORD, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning March 16, 1975, as National Poison Prevention Week.
I invite all agencies and organizations concerned with preventing accidental poisoning among our Nation's children to engage in activities that will speed our Nation's progress in protecting all our children against lasting injury or death from accidental poisoning.

In a world plagued by violence and suffering, clergymen of all denominations help lead the human family to the "peace of God, which passeth all understanding." In a time of difficult choices and moral questioning, they point the way to the higher values of conduct.
As God's ministers on earth, practicing the human virtues of charity, humanity and compassion, they bring us closer to each other and nearer to our Creator.

American Heart Month, 1975

By the President of the Vnited States of America
A Proclamation
An cstiniatca 28.5 million Americans suffer from some form of heart and bloo-d \'csscl disease. These diseases cause more than one million deaths each year. Approximately twent\-five percent of these deaths occur among' persons under age 65.
Although heart and blood vessel diseases still account for slightly more than half of all deaths each year in the United States, death rates from these disorders declined over the five-year period 1968 1973 (the most recent year for which reliable statistics are available).
This decline did not just happen. It has been achieved through the application of improved methods of prevention, diagnosis, and treatment that has grown out of an intensive and sustained research effort.
Over the years, two agencies ha\e been the prime movers in the Nation's assault on the cardiovascular diseases. One is the National Heart and Lung Institute, an agency of the Federal Government; the other is the American Heart Association, a voluntary health organization that draws its operating funds from private contributions. For more than 25 years, the two organizations have worked hand-in-hand toward common goals: to search for and apply new or improved methods of prevention, diagnosis, and treatment for cardiovascular disorders; to support the training of research and clinical personnel in the cardiovascular field; to provide community service to victims of cardiovascular diseases; and to carry out programs of information and education on cardiovascular topics for health professionals and .for the general public.
Fo encourage continuation of this combined assault on the cardio\ascular diseases, the Congress has requested the President to issue annually a proclamation designating February as American Heart Month.
NOW, F H F R F F O R E , I, GFRALD R. FORD, President of the LInitcd States of America, do hereby proclaim the month of February 1975, as American Heart Month. And I invite the Governors of the States, the Conmionwealth of Puerto Rico, and the officials of other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, to heed the nation-

1974 Census of Agriculture

February 6, 1975

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

A periodic census of all the American people is required by the Constitution as the basis for apportioning representation in Congress, In addition, Congress has since 1840 provided for a sf>ecial census of agriculture to periodically meet the Nation's requirements for reliable and timely statistics on this indispensable segment of our economy.
The 1974 Census of Agriculture has just begun. Statistics for more than 2.5 million farms will be collected to provide measures of the farm industry and agricultural economy for the Nation, each State, and every county. These data will be aggregated for use by virtually every segment of American society--farmers and their representative groups, the Congress, Federal agencies, State and local governments, educational institutions, private businesses, and consumer organizations.
Under the statute authorizing this Census, receipients of census questionnaires are required to answer the questions in those questionnaires that apply to them, their families, and their farms to insure the accurate compilation of these statistics. The sole purpose of the Census is to secure general statistical information regarding agriculture and related resources of the country. No person can be harmed in any way by furnishing the information required. The Census has nothing to do with taxation or the enforcement of any National, State, or local law or ordinance. The Census Act expressly provides that there will be no public or private disclosure regirding any person or his affairs. To assure the due protection of the

Save Your Vision Week, 1975

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
One of every twenty people in the United States suffers some degree of visual disability. Yet, many eye injuries and disorders could be pre\ ented if Americans took greater care to preserve their vision. Simple measures, such as wearing protective goggles when engaged in hazardous activity, will help avoid eye injuries and save sight. Many disorders that impair vision or cause blindness can be arrested before the eyes become seriously damaged, if they are detected and treated early in their development. Even blindness can sometimes be cured. For example, 95 percent of the 5,000 Americans blinded or visually disabled by cataract, for whom surgery is recommended, could have their vision restored.
Researchers in the visual science are continually striving to reduce the toll of visual disability. Advances made in vision research, many of which

PROCLAMATION 4350--FEB. 6, 1975

89 STAT. 1243

have been supported by the Federal Government through the National Rye Institute, and by several philanthropic organizations, can benefit many Americans if only we avail ourselves of them. The simplest way is by making eye examinations a routine part of health care through the professional guidance of ophthalmologists, optometrists, and opticians. All of us should know where to go in our communities for assistance in visual problems. We must be aware of preventive measures that can be taken at home, school, work, and play to protect our vision. We must learn the warning signals of serious eye problems so we know when to seek professional attention.

To encourage all of us to protect our vision and to care properly for our eyes. Congress, by joint resolution, approved December 30, 1963 (77 Stat. 629; 36 U.S.C. 169a), has requested the President to proclaim the first week in March of each year as Save Your Vision Week.

NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, GERALD R. F O R D , President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week of March 2 through March 8, 1975, as Save Your Vision Week. I urge all Americans to join in this observance by taking steps to assure eye safety and by making themselves aware of the vision care facilities available in their communities. I invite the appropriate officials of State and local governments to issue similar Proclamations.

I also invite the communications media, the health care professions, and all other agencies and individuals concerned with the improvement and preservation of vision, to join in public activities supporting programs to improve and protect the vision of Americans.

Despite the need to conserve energy, there are still opportunities on our rivers, lakes, and coastal waters to enjoy sailing and other recreational boating. But these opportunities carry the responsibility of practicing safe boating by developing essential skills.
Recognizing the growth in recreational boating, the Congress, by joint resolution approved June 4, 1958 (72 Stat. 179; 36 U.S.C. 161), requested the President to proclaim annually the week which includes July 4th as National Safe Boating Week.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, GERALD R. F O R D , President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning June 29, 1975, as National Safe Boating Week.
I urge all who utilize our waters, in the American tradition of fair play, to provide for the safety of other boaters, as well as themselves, by becoming equipped with basic boating safety knowledge. This information is readily available through numerous safe boating courses offered by governmental and private organizations, such as the United States Coast Guard, the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary, the United States Power Squadrons, the American Red Cross, and the various State agencies. All pleasure boat operators should take advantage of the many available boating safety courses. Only through education can we minimize boating accidents. I further urge all organizations offering boating safety instruction to reach into every possible related recreational area to encourage boating education.
I also invite the Governors of the States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa, and the Mayor of the District of Columbia to provide for the observance of this week.

Red Cross Month, 1975

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation
Since the first settlement on these shores, we Americans have worked together voluntarily to conquer problems and to care for one another in time of adversity. This neighbor-helping-neighbor approach is still with us today and is exemplified by an organization that has become known as the Good Neighbor--the American National Red Cross.
We can all be grateful that the Red Cross is here in time of need. When disasters occur, this Good Neighbor responds with quick and openhanded assistance to help the injured and homeless. When the need is blood, the Red Cross provides this previous fluid from volunteer donors to more than half of this nation's medical facilities. This Good Neighbor, through its first aid and water safety training programs, arms us with the knowledge and skill to save our own and the lives of others. Veterans and members of the military services, often separated far from their loved ones, also turn to the Red Cross for help in time of personal crisis.
The American Red Cross, governed both nationally and in our communities by boards made up of volunteers, is dependent upon each one of us for its existence. It is financed primarily by voluntary contributions and its services are made available largely through the work of volunteers.
Traditionally, March is Red Cross Month. During that month, more than half of the 3,100 Red Cross chapters will be asking Americans to be Good Neighbors by making contributions. In communities where the Red Cross is in partnership with United Way, these chapters will be asking us to lend our time and skills as volunteers in one of their many service programs.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, GERALD R. FORD, President of the United States of America, and Honorary Chairman of the American National Red Cross, do hereby designate March, 1975, as Red Cross Month.

Loyalty Day, 1975

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
It is now nearly two hundred years since America's Independence was sought and won. Then, as today, the achievement of our Nation's goals was met through the devoted efforts of Americans who gave loyal service.
The United States has become the greatest Nation in history because of the loyalty of our people to our Constitution, to our laws, and to those ideals which they represent.
The thousands who become citizens each year through naturalization take an oath to support the United States. One can sense the meaning and the spirit of loyalty in those proceedings. For most of us who were born to the freedoms we enjoy, a declaration of loyalty has not been such a conspicuous event in our lives. It is, nonetheless, reflected in our patriotic efforts.
In recognition of the need for "a special day for the reaffirmation of loyalty to the United States of America and for the recognition of the heritage of American freedom", the Congress, by a joint resolution of July 18, 1958 (72 Stat. 369, 36 U.S.C. 162), designated May 1 of each year as Loyalty Day, inviting the people of the United States to observe such day with appropriate ceremonies.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, GERALD R. FORD, President of the United States of America, do call upon the people of the United States and upon patriotic, civic, and educational organizations to observe Thursday, May 1, 1975, as Loyalty Day, with appropriate ceremonies.
I call upon appropriate officials of the Government to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on that day in testimony of our loyalty to this Nation.

Cancer Control Month, 1975

March 26, 1975

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Our intensive effort against cancer, sustained by the constant dedication and determination of scientists, physicians, public officials and private citizens, continues to provide hope and assistance to ever-increasing numbers of Americans.

PROCLAMATION 4358--MAR. 26, 1975

89 STAT. 1253

The National Cancer Act of 1971 was a landmark piece of legislation which authorized new Federal support for cancer research. The amendments of 1974 have added new emphasis to our National Cancer Program, especially in the dissemination of the latest scientific findings from the research laboratory and clinic to practicing physicians, cancer patients, and those in particular jeopardy of cancer.
Despite this progress, the conquest of cancer will not be easy or quick. Cancer statistics remain depressing. An estimated 665,000 new cases will be diagnosed in 1975. Although we shall ultimately achieve victory over these killer diseases, it requires our unwavering support of cancer research and control.
As a means of giving continued emphasis to the cancer problem, the Congress, by a joint resolution of March 28, 1938 (52 Stat. 148, 36 U.S.C. 150), requested the President to issue annually a proclamation setting aside the month of April as Cancer Control Month.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, GERALD R. FORD, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the month of April, 1975, as Cancer Control Month, and I invite the Governors of the States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the appropriate officials of all other areas under the United States flag, to issue similar proclamations.
To give renewed emphasis to this serious problem, and to encourage the determination of the American people to meet it, 1 also ask the medical and health professions, the communications media, and all other interested persons and groups to unite in public reaffirmation of our Nation's abiding commitment to control cancer.

National Farm Safety Week, 1975

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
The demand for agricultural products is at an all-time high both here and abroad. In addition to supplying food for the tables of over 213 million Americans, America's farms and ranches are seen by many millions of people abroad as a source of nourishment. Our agricultural abundance is possible not only because of the blessings of fertile soil and advanced technology, but also because of the capable, hard-working, innovative people in whose hands these immense food and fiber resources are entrusted.
Maintenance of a high level of agricultural production is not without such impediments as shortages of some supplies needed for production, adverse weather and accidents. Farmers and ranchers may not be able to control shortages or nature. But they can do a great deal to control accidents which seriously injure and kill thousands of farm and ranch residents each year. Along with the human suffering and material losses to farm and ranch families, accidents handicap our efforts to feed and clothe our people and help alleviate hunger in the world. Maximum production will be possible only when accident numbers are reduced to a minimum.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, GERALD R. FORD, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning July 25, 1975, as National Farm Safety Week. During this week and the ensuing year, I urge all who live and work on the Nation's farms and ranches to plan for accident prevention and to implement their plans with intelligence and resolve. Further, I invite all who work with and serve our agricultural producers to back these personal accident prevention efforts with every possible encouragement and educational aid. Any strategy to reap full production from our agricultural enterprises must include planning for the safety of those who live and work on our farms and ranches, not only when in the field but also when at home, at play or on the Nation's public roads.

 World Trade Week, 1975

April 5, 1975

By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation

America approaches the 200th anniversary of national independence at a time when events at home and abroad demonstrate the interdependence of the community of nations.
Interdependence and its impact on all Americans is particularly apparent in world trade.
Through world trade, Americans expand with others the flow of goods and services to all peoples and enhance the economic well-being of all countries. In so doing, we recommit the United States to an open world economic order and reconfirm our pledge to international peace and understanding.
The Congress of the United States underscored America's dedication to more free and fair international commerce with passage of the Trade Act of 1974. That act enables us to move toward multilateral negotiations that will open the way to improved access to foreign markets for American goods and to vital raw materials.
In the face of economic stress at home, more exports mean more jobs for Americans, more purchasing power for America's consumers and more business for our manufacturers. Exports help us meet the swiftly rising cost of the energy we consume. They are the source of equilibrium in our balance of payments.
World trade joins nations in peaceful and creative partnership. It has greater significance today than ever before.
NOW, THEREFORE, 1, GERALD R. FORD, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning May 18, 1975, as World Trade Week, and I call upon all Americans to

The American merchant marine is now being assisted by the largest peacetime shipbuilding program ever undertaken in this country. This will enable America's imports and exports to be moved efficiently over the world's trade routes.
The ships of highly advanced designs coming down the ways will greatly improve the competitiveness and capabilities of our merchant fleet. They will restore the United States to the rank of a first-class maritime power.

National Defense Transportation Day and National Transportation Week, 1975

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Throughout the history of the United States, our progress as a Nation has been closely tied to progress in the development of our transportation system. Generations of men and women who pioneered and developed the great networks by which we move goods and people today stand high in the ranks of those who have helped make America great.
As the Nation grew, so did its need for mobility. During the last century, this need was well served by expanding rail and water transportation systems. Today, the need is served by a broader range of systems. Motor vehicles and aircraft provide rapid access to every region.
There are still changing needs and new demands for the movement of our people and the goods they produce. Yesterday's methods may not be adequate to overcome the problem of congestion in many of our large

PROCLAMATION 4365--APR. 10, 1975

population centers. Also, fuels that have powered our transportation rnachinery in the past may not be sufficient to meet the demands of the future.
So, once again, we look to the people in our transportation industry to make the adjustments required by the changing times. We look to them with the confidence that they will perform as they have in the past and provide improvements that will ensure fast, safe, efficient, and convenient transportation.
In acknowledgement of the importance of our transportation system, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 16, 1957 (71 Stat. 30, 36 U.S.C. 160), requested the President to proclaim the third Friday in May of each year as National Defense Transportation Day, and, by a joint resolution approved May 14, 1962 (76 Stat. 69, 36 U.S.C. 166), requested the President to proclaim the week in which that Friday falls as National Transportation Week.

Each year, we and other members of the Organization of American States celebrate our shared origins and the close ties that continue to flourish among us. To do this, we commemorate a significant event in the diplomatic history of the Western Hemisphere--the founding, late in the last century, of the International Union of the American Republics. This year marks the 85th anniversary of the establishment of that first inter-governmental regional organization and forerunner of the Organization of American States.
From its earliest days, the organization has taken for its two major objectives the maintenance of peace and the promotion of economic, social and cultural development in the Americas. The strength and longevity of inter-American cooperation in furtherance of these goals derives from its tested ability to evolve and reconstitute itself to meet new realities and new challenges over the years.
In the Americas, we have come to recognize the fresh challenge presented by a new interdependence, which is global as well as hemispheric, linking developed with less developed countries both in and beyond the hemisphere. We sense the opportunity for effective interAmerican cooperation to advance our traditional goals of peace and progress for our hemisphere while strengthening the global cooperation decreed by our world.

Small Business Week, 1975

April 14, 1975

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Small business has been a vital part of American life from the very beginning. The colonial traders, craftsmen and merchants of two centuries ago have been replaced by an enormous range of dealers in goods and services of all kinds, but the original opportunity, and the determination to excel, remain. Small business in America is still the free enterprise system's gateway to opportunity--the means by which millions of Americans continue to build a better life for themselves and their families.
Out of the estimated 9.7 million businesses in America today, more than 9 million are small. They account for nearly half of the gross business product and more than half of the business labor force. Our American success story could never have been achieved, and would not continue, without this impressive contribution by small business.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, GERALD R. FORD, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning May 25, 1975, as Small Business Week.

We Americans have traditionally set aside one day each year to give special honor to our mothers. In 1975, International Women's Year, this tribute takes on even greater significance.
Of the many occupations in which women serve today, one of the most demanding is that of being a mother. It is demanding not only because of the skills, knowledge and perseverance required, but because of the importance of success. There is no area of endeavor which can have a greater impact on our future than the care and guidance of our children and young people. It is appropriate that we observe Mother's Day in a manner which acknowledges our appreciation for our own mothers and our respect for all of those who perform this vital role in our society.
The Congress, by a joint resolution of May 8, 1914 (38 Stat. 770, 36 U.S.C. 141, 142), designated the second Sunday in May of each year as a day on which we honor all mothers for their countless contributions to their families, to their communities and to the Nation.

Older Americans Month, 1975

May 1, 1975

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
There is increasing awareness throughout America of the growing national resource represented by our older citizens. Their collective knowledge, experience, and energy can contribute significantly to raising the quality of life for all Americans.
As we approach our national Bicentennial, it is important to take special notice of older Americans. They have made and are making significant contributions to our Nation. It is fitting that we not lose sight of the continuing contributions this generation can make nor of our commitment as a society to meet their needs.

The second White House Conference on Aging, held in 1971, broadened that recognition and deepened our commitment to providing opportunities to our older citizens for maintenance of income and health and for self-realization and continuing usefulness. It is appropriate to update the Charter in the light of growing knowledge and recognition of the needs and abilities of our older citizens. People of all ages should join in the development of a Declaration of Rights and Obligations of Older Persons so that it can be proclaimed as part of our Bicentennial celebration.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, GERALD R. FORD, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the month of May 1975 as Older Americans Month. I urge everyone to participate in the eflforts to achieve the goal of proclaiming a new Declaration of Rights and Obligations for Older Persons, which can become a rallying point for our Nation during the Bicentennial year of 1976 and a guide to action during the years ahead.

National Arthritis Month, 1975

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Arthritis, the oldest known chronic disease, is still the Nation's greatest crippler. This disease and related rheumatic disorders afflict more than 20 million people in the United States, at an annual cost of about $4 billion, and are exceeded only by heart disease as the most common chronic illness in the country today.
Recognition of this major public health problem and determination to combat it effectively have been demonstrated through the passage of the National Arthritis Act of 1974 by the United States Congress, which 42 use 289c-1

I was pleased to sign earlier this year. As this legislation makes plain, the total cost of arthritis must be counted not only in terms of dollars, but of human suffering and disability. Uncontrolled arthritis significantly decreases the quality of American life and has a negative economic, social, and psychological impact on the families of those afflicted.
We have learned a great deal through governmentally and privately supported research. Yet this disorder is not fully understood and it is not adequately controllable. We must meet the critical need for new research ideas and studies upon which advances in the area of arthritis treatment and prevention can be based. Our goal continues to be the eventual elimination of arthritis as a cause of human suffering and dire expense to our Nation.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, GERALD R. FORD, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the month of May, 1975, as National Arthritis Month. 1 urge the people of the United States and educational, philanthropic, scientific, medical and health care organizations and professionals to advance the programs of our national effort to discover the cause and cures of arthritis and other rheumatic diseases and to alleviate the suffering of victims of these disorders.

knowledge and appreciation of our history, of who we are, where we are, and how we arrived here.
Loss of the essential evidence of our heritage in the name of progress continues to occur. However, the counteracting efTect of the historic preservation effort is increasingly evident and effective in both the public and private sector. National Historic Preservation Week offers a timely opportunity to illustrate what has been done and what can be accomplished in the future to carry out our national resolve to preserve this heritage. This includes not only structures of national historic significance but, of equal importance, old homes, buildings, both commercial and industrial, hotels, taverns, theaters and railroad passenger stations. These can be recycled for contemporary private, public, cultural, commemorative and other uses.
Such uses of our historic man-made resources reflect our commitment to the enrichment of present and future generations of Americans, to preserve our historic past and to assure its enhancement and appreciation and to thus significantly contribute to the revitalization of rural, community and urban development.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, GERALD R.

Prayer for Peace Memorial Day May 26, 1975

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
At the height of the Civil War, President Lincoln proclaimed at a battlefield cemetery "that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain." Shortly after that tragic war, a day was set aside each year to honor those who gave their lives.
Over 100 years have passed since that simple but moving ceremony at Gettysburg. There have been many Memorial Days, and many more Americans have died in defense of what we believe in. As Thomas Paine said, "Those who would reap the blessings of freedom must . . . undergo the fatigue of supporting it." Today, because of the sacrifice and courage of American men and women, we are a free Nation at peace.
Let us dedicate ourselves today, and every day, to honoring those valiant Americans who died in service to their country. Let us gain strength from their sacrifice and devote ourselves to the peaceful pursuits which freedom allows and progress demands.
With faith in ourselves, future Memorial Days will find us still united in our purpose. Let us join together in working toward the greatest memorial we can construct for those who lay down their lives for us-- a peace so durable that there will be no need for further sacrifices.
In recognition of those Americans to whom we pay tribute today, the Congress, by joint resolution of May 11, 1950 (64 Stat. 158), has requested that the President issue a Proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to observe each Memorial Day as a day of prayer for permanent peace and to designate a period during that day when the people of the United States might unite in prayer.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, GERALD R. FORD, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Memorial Day, Monday, May 26, 1975, as a day of prayer for permanent peace, and I designate the hour beginning in each locality at 11 o'clock in the morning of that day as a time to unite in prayer.

I also call upon the Governors of the fifty States, the Governor of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and appropriate officials of all local units of government to direct that the flag be flown at half-stafif on all public buildings during the customary forenoon period; and I request the people of the United States to display the flag at half-stafif from their homes for the same period.

Growing up has never been easy. We have all experienced moments of sorrow, disappointment, and frustration. And there have been times of joy and great satisfaction. For each of us, there have been special men along the way--men who cared.

Proclamation 4378



May 28, 1975

Flag Day and National Flag Week, 1975

By the President of the tJnited States of America
A Proclamation
Two hundred years ago, American minutemen raised their muskets at the Old North Bridge. What Ralph Waldo Emerson called "the shot heard around the world" rang out. The American Revolution had begun. Two years later, while the outcome of the Revolutionary War remained in doubt, the Continental Congress met in Philadelphia on June 14, 1777, and approved the following resolution:
"Resolved, that the flag of the thirteen United States be thirteen stripes, alternate red and white: that the union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing a new constellation."
That short and unadorned declaration gave birth to our flag. With the addition of thirty-seven stars, and after two centuries of history, the flag chosen in Philadelphia is our flag today, symbolizing our commitment as a people to freedom, equaUty, and independence.
To commemorate the adoption of our flag, the Congress, by a joint resolution of August 3, 1949 (63 Stat. 492, 36 U.S.C. 157), designated June 14 of each year as Flag Day and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation calling for its observance. The Congress also requested the President, by joint resolution of June 9, 1966 (80 Stat. 194, 36 U.S.C. 157a), to issue annually a proclamation designating the week in which June 14 occurs cis National Flag Week and to call upon

PROCLAMATION 4378--MAY 28, 1975

89 STAT. 1279

all citizens of the United States to display the flag of the United States on those days.
This year, Flag Day is an especially historic occasion, since it is also the Bicentennial birthday of the United States Army. Two hundred years ago, on June 14, 1775, the Continental Congress adopted resolutions which in effect established the military units of New England as the official national army. By this action, the Continental Army was created and the Nation's military service was bom. The U.S. Navy and the U.S. Marine Corps were established later that same year by the Continental Congress.

It is appropriate, as our Nation launches its Bicentennial commemoration, that the United States flag, first flown two centuries ago, be displayed together with an ensign bearing the official American Revolution Bicentennial Symbol set on a white field, which is designated as the official Bicentennial Flag.

NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, GERALD R. FORD, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning June 8, 1975, as National Flag Week and I call upon the appropriate officials of the government to display the National Flag on all government buildings during that week. The heads of all government departments and agencies are also authorized and requested to provide, as they deem appropriate, for the flying of the official Bicentennial Flag, on government buildings, military installations, naval vessels, and other places where the United States flag is flown, during that period and for the remainder of the year 1975 and the entire year 1976. I urge all Americans to observe Flag Day, June 14, and Flag Week this year by flying the Stars and Stripes from their homes and other suitable places.

National Day of Prayer, 1975

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
As we begin the celebration of our Bicentennial, it is fitting to recall that it was a profound faith in God which inspired the Founders of our Nation. Two hundred years ago, on June 12, 1775, the Second Continental Congress called upon the inhabitants of all the Colonies to unite, on a designated Thursday in July, in "humiliation, fasting, and prayer." This was our first national day of prayer.
Americans on that day were asked to address their prayers to the "Great Governor of the World" to preserve their new Union and secure civil and religious liberties.
Those first prayers were answered in full measure. The Union survives. The liberties for which our forefathers prayed were never so secure as they are today. But material progress and human achievement often beckon mankind away from the spiritual virtues.
As we prepare to mark the 200th anniversary of the birth of our Nation, it is my fervent hope that Americans will not forget that it was prayer that helped to forge our freedoms and foster our liberties.
Let us now pray--as we have done throughout our history, and as the Congress has requested (66 Stat. 64)--for the wisdom to continue the American pilgrimage, striving toward a nobler existence for all humanity. Let us ask for the strength to meet the challenges that face our Nation. Let us give thanks to God for the many blessings granted to America throughout these two centuries.

White Cane Safety Day, 1975

June 23, 1975

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
The white cane is universally recognized as one of the simplest yet most effective aids to the independent mobility of the blind. Today, as blind persons are participating in the mainstream of active life, the white cane has also become a symbol of their capacity to contribute meaningfully to the progress of all Americans.
One of the most gratifying developments in our efforts to achieve better lives for all Americans is the advancement of social and economic opportunities for blind citizens. This growth is represented by the widening array of jobs capably handled by the blind. Well trained bhnd persons are working in nearly every trade, profession, and calling. Modern techniques of mobility and the increased use of the white cane have made this possible.
Still, as useful as the white cane is for helping the visually disabled person achieve self-reliance, it has its limitations. It cannot, for instance, warn of an approaching vehicle. Motorists and bicyclists should, therefore, be particularly alert for pedestrians using white canes and respond to their presence with an extra measure of care and caution.
In order that Americans may be made more fully aware of the significance of the white cane, and of the need for motorists and bicyclists to exercise caution and courtesy when approaching visually handicapped persons, the Congress, by joint resolution (78 Stat. 1003; 36 U.S.C. 169d), has authorized the President to proclaim October 15 of each year as White Cane Safety Day.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, GERALD R. FORD, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Wednesday, October 15, 1975, as White Cane Safety Day. I call upon all Americans to exercise

89 STAT. 1282

understanding and awareness of the special needs of our fellow citizens who are visually handicapped in order that they may enjoy the greatest possible measure of personal independence and safety as they use our streets and public facilities.

Women's Equality Day, 1975

August 26, 1975

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
In October 1971 and March 1972, the House of Representatives and the Senate of the United States adopted a proposed amendment to our Constitution providing equal rights for men and women. By August 26, 1972, twenty States had ratified the proposed constitutional amendment, only eighteen more were needed for the proposed amendment to become part of our Constitution.
August 26 is a significant date because it was on that day in 1920 that ^^^ Nineteenth Amendment, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex with regard to voting, was certified as part of our Constitution after ratification by the necessary three-fourths of the States. Recognizing that the proposed Equal Rights Amendment is the logical and rightful extension of the Nineteenth Amendment to rights other than voting, the President has, since 1972, annually set aside the 26th of August in recognition

PROCLAMATION 4383--AUG. 26, 1975

of the real and practical need to ensure that equal legal rights are enjoyed by women and men.

This year, 1975, has been designated as International Women's Year, dedicated to equality between men and women. It is also the twohundredth year of our Nation--a Nation born, nurtured and dedicated to the proposition that all people are entitled to be equal before the law.

Several more States need to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment before

it becomes part of our Constitution. It would be most fitting for this to be

accomplished during our Nation's two-hundredth year. In this Land of

women are equal before the law.

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Two hundred years ago, the men and women of the American Revolution pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor in the struggle for independence, which ended September 3, 1783, with the signing of the Treaty of Paris. In breaking with the past, they did not neglect to build a better system for their posterity.
Today, we look back 200 years, not merely to take pride in our history; we look back during this Bicentennial to learn some practical lessons for today and tomorrow. As we pay tribute, let us renew together our Founding Fathers' pledge to our country--our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor. Let us always remember that freedom does not come free.
Congress, by a joint resolution of February 29, 1952, designated the 17th day of September of each year as Citizenship Day in commemoration of the forrriation and signing of the Constitution of the United States on September 17, 1787, and authorized the President to issue annually a proclamation calling upon officials of the Government to display the United States flag on all Government buildings on such day. By a joint resolution of August 2, 1956, Congress authorized the President to designate the period beginning September 17 and ending September 23 of each year as Constitution Week and to issue a proclamation calling for the observance of such week.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, GERALD R. FORD, President of the United States of America, call upon appropriate Government officials to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on Citizenship Day, September 17, 1975--the 188th anniversary of the signing of the Constitution, I urge Federal, State, and local officials, as well as leaders of civic, educational and religious organizations, to conduct appropriate ceremonies and programs on that day.

National Hispanic Heritage Week, 1975

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Men and women of Hispanic origin--Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, Cubans and other Spanish Speaking Americans--have contributed significantly to the growth of America. They have served with courtage and distinction in our Armed Forces. In endeavors as varied as music, architecture, medicine, law, education, literature and religion, Hispanic-Americans have contributed wisdom, beauty and spiritual strength.
No manner of tribute to our country's Hispanic heritage could be more appropriate in this Bicentennial year than to acknowledge the importance of the Spanish contribution to the success of our own War of Independence. Spanish-led military forces protected the Colonies' southern front and kept the Mississippi River open for navigation and the delivery of supplies to the Americans in the southwest. Don Bernardo de Galvez, Spanish Captain General and Governor of Spanish Louisiana, led these successful campaigns and, in 1781, captured the heavily fortified city of Pensacola from the British.
The assistance to our Revolution from Galvez and the Hispanic troops he commanded has not always received the recognition it deserved in our history books. But the name Galvez has enjoyed commemoration through the Texas city we know as Galveston.

One hundred and fifty years ago, 47 men, women and children arrived in New York harbor aboard the Norwegian sloop "Restaurationen." Although Norway's links to the New World date back to the 11th century, when Norse mariners led by Leif Erikson discovered Vinland, the arrival of the "Restaurationen" on October 9, 1825, marked the beginning of an important new era in the histories of both Norway and America.
The small group of debarking emigrants were the first of thousands-- the earliest wave in a tide of settlers and pioneers who would help to tame a savage wilderness, clear the prairies and cultivate the soil.
Whole new communities would be founded by these Norwegian Americans. Their folklore, music, religious and ethnic traditions were to enrich the cultural heritage of the American people.

Fire Prevention Week, 1975

By the President of the tlnited States of America
A Proclamation
The United States can ill-afford to continue to see its resources devoured by ruinous fires. The personal suffering and loss of life, and the destruction of our national wealth and production capabilities, are a needless drain on our Nation. We need to eliminate it.
A recent Bureau of Census survey of household fires indicates that annually one in every sixteen households has a fire which does or could have disastrous results. Most of these fires are avoidable--caused by needless and careless acts. Our national goal should be to achieve an annual reduction in fire deaths, injuries and property losses, cutting those losses in half within a generation. Every American can and must help to prevent these fires.
The business community has a special responsibility to provide fire-safe products. Builders, architects and engineers have a responsibility to pro-

89 STAT. 1290

PROCLAMATION 4387--SEPT. 9, 1975

vide fire-safe places in which to work and live. Local governments have a responsibility to enact and enforce adequate codes and encourage good fire prevention practices. And fire departments have important responsibilities in providing strong fire prevention programs in their communities, as well as to fight fires and save lives when all else fails.

NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, GERALD R. FORD, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning October 5, 1975, as Fire Prevention Week. I call upon each individual and family to participate in the programs of Fire Survival and Exit Drills In The Home to assure safe evacuation in emergencies; and for businesses to conduct year-round fire prevention to include emphasis of on-and-ofT-the-job applications of fire safety practices.
I also call upon the National Fire Protection Association, members of the Joint Council of National Fire Service Organizations, and other fire safety organizations to join with the National Fire Prevention and Control Administration in providing leadership and materials for a national fire prevention effort.
Local community and fire department organizations are asked to provide the direction and support necessary to assure that each horrie and business is invited to participate in Fire Prevention Week activities; and Federal agencies are asked to provide an example for the Nation by communicating fire-safe practices to all employees, and by cooperating in State and local activities.

Our admiration for the achievement of Christopher Columbus has not dimmed over the span of nearly five centuries. Sailing in the service of the Spanish Crown, whose vision and support made his journey possible, Columbus pursued his dream in the face of enormous challenges with an unshakable courage and faith that set an example for future generations of Americans.

Of all of the important days to be celebrated during America's Bicentennial, none is more worthy of special observance than Veterans Day. Had not the patriotic men and women, to whom we pay deserved and grateful tribute on Veterans Day, heard and answered freedom's call during the past 200 years, there would be no American Bicentennial of freedom.
From Lexington and Concord in 1775 to the present, these courageous, selfless patriots served and sacrificed and died so that their fellow-citizens could live under a government that still is in the full tide of successful experiment and still is the world's best hope.

National Saint Elizabeth Seton Day

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Among the most important elements of America's Bicentennial observance---and of everyday American life for nearly 200 years--is the religious heritage of our Nation, rich in its diversity and its quality.
The singular devotion, faith and courage of such servants of God as Elizabeth Ann Seton give life to that heritage and inspiration to us all.
On Sunday, September 14, 1975, His Holiness Pope Paul VI will confer upon "Mother Seton," as she is known to millions of Roman Catholics, the rites of canonization. From that day. Mother Seton will be Saint Elizabeth Seton, the first American-born saint of the Roman Catholic Church.
Born in New York more than 200 years ago. Mother Seton was content in her early years to live the common life of the 18th century woman. But tragedy entered her life, leaving her a widow at a young age and with five children. Moving to Emmitsburg, Maryland, she turned to the work of her church, took the vows of a nun and later founded the Sisters of Charity of St. Joseph, an order of nuns devoted to teaching.
Mother Seton established the first parochial school in America, the foundation for an educational system that has brought the priceless gift of knowledge to millions of Americans, including a multitude of newly arrived immigrants whom Mother Seton and her followers instructed in the language and the ways of their new homeland.
For her devout faith and diligent service in the Kingdom of God, her church is bestowing its highest honor on Mother Seton on September 14, 1975.

One hundred and ninety-six years ago, Casimir Pulaski, a Polish patriot in exile, gave his life in the struggle for American independence.
General Pulaski came to the United States in 1777, when barely 30 years of age, to join George Washington's Revolutionary Army. He served with great distinction at Brandywine and was promoted by the Continental Congress to the rank of Brigadier General. He commanded a cavalry division and later organized an independent corps of cavalry and light infantry which won acclaim as Pulaski's Legion. In October, 1779, during the Battle of Savannah, he was mortally wounded while leading his cavalry unit in a daring charge.
It is appropriate to commemorate General Pulaski's heroic sacrifice in the cause of freedom.

National Employ the Handicapped Week, 1975

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
America offers a promise that all its people who are willing and qualified to work shall have an equal opportunity to do so. Elimination of many discriminatory barriers has moved us closer toward the fulfillment of that promise. For our handicapped citizens, however, much more needs to be done.
The barriers facing the handicapped are not so much their own disabilities, but the attitudes of the non-handicapped toward their disabilities.
Those of us who are not handicapped think of what we could not do if we lost an arm or a leg, lost our sight or our voice, or were disabled in some other way. We often forget that the handicapped are thinking of what they can do.
We must learn to think like them--positively! We must look not at what they cannot do, but at what they can do. We must look beyond the disability to the positive ability.
The disabled can perform a wide range of jobs with skill and efficiency. They do not need special jobs. They need the opportunity to compete, to prove that they can perform.
The Congress has recognized our special responsibility to the handicapped and, by a joint resolution approved August 11, 1945, as amended (36U.S.C. 155), has asked the President to issue a suitable proclamation.

I call upon the Governors of the States, mayors and other public officials, and leaders of industry, labor, education, religious, veteran, farm, scientific, professional and other groups to join with the handicapped themselves in making the American people aware of the value and fairness of employing handicapped men and women.
Also, I call upon all employers to review and broaden their policies toward the employment of the handicapped.

National Hunting and Fishing Day, 1975

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
The great natural resources which belong to America meant survival to our forefathers. The abundance of fish and wildlife enabled the early settlers to withstand the first winters. Later this abundance helped pioneers to make their way across the continent.
Today, our outdoor sportsmen help to assure the survival of our natural resources. Hunters and fishermen contribute to the preservation and protection of America's fish and wildlife through their voluntary conservation efforts and by providing millions of dollars for restoration programs, acquisition and maintenance of habitat and supportive research. These funds come through the purchase of licenses and excise taxes on sporting equipment.
In recognition of the significant contributions by American hunters and fishermen, to dramatize the continued need for gun and boat safety and to promote the conservation of our resources, the Congress, by Senate

 Child Health Day, 1975

September 24, 1975

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
In the years since 1928, when Child Health Day was first proclaimed, our concept of health has acquired new dimensions. No longer do we consider health merely the timely treatment and cure of illness. Health now encompasses the prevention of those conditions which can lead to illness.
Scientific technology and medical research have given us many new tools to help in the essential tasks of preventing illness or conditions which can cripple. Thanks to vaccines which have been developed in recent decades, poliomyelitis is no longer the widespread crippler it once was. Children can now be protected against measles and the risk of death or brain damage resulting from this disease. Immunization against rubella not only protects young children, but also protects pregnant women from contracting the disease and risking the mental health of their unborn children.
Future challenge includes prevention of such divergent problems as birth abnormality, the battered child syndrome and the teen-age alcoholic, drug addict or criminal.

89 STAT. 1300

PROCLAMATION 4397--OCT. 2, 1975

In our Bicentennial year as a Nation, we are charting a course for the future that will enable us to complete the American dream. We can be certain that future scientific discoveries will help to control and conquer other conditions which now cripple or otherwise handicap children. For the present, each of us must resolve to apply the knowledge and the means now at hand for the fullest protection of our children's health.
As an expression of its concern, the Congress, by joint resolution (36 U.S.C. 143), has asked the President to designate the first Monday in October as Child Health Day.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, GERALD R. FORD, President of the United States of America, do proclaim Monday, October 6, 1975, as Child Health Day.
I ask American parents on Child Health Day this year to place special emphasis on ensuring protection for their children against all diseases for which safe and effective vaccines are now available.
I call upon all citizens, agencies and organizations interested in child welfare to promote and observe appropriate activities, especially those which emphasize the preventive immunizations so necessary for proper health care.

that proposed amendment, it will become a fitting constitutional heritage of our Bicentennial era.
Our efforts at home have been linked with those of other nations. This year, citizens of the United States participated in the world Conference on International Women's Year held in Mexico City on June 19 through July 2, 1975, to develop guidelines for a sustained, long-term effort to achieve the objectives of International Women's Year.
Also this year, members of our Nation's legal profession will be joined by lawyers, professors, and jurists from more than one hundred nations during the week of October 12, 1975, at a World Law Conference, under the auspices of the World Peace Through Law Center, held in our Nation's capital. The agenda of the World Law Conference will deal with a host of international legal issues, ranging from the role of multinational companies to laws governing oil pollution at sea.
The theme of the World Law Conference is the achievement of legal equality between men and women. A portion of the agenda will be devoted to discussing the elimination of discrimination against women.
The President of the United States, along with the leaders of other nations, for more than a decade has encouraged the significant international efforts represented by these World Law Conferences. With its theme of legal equality between men and women, it is fitting, during this International Women's Year, to do so again.

National Forest Products Week, 1975

By the President of the tlnited States of America

A Proclamation

Among our Nation's most valuable and unique natural resources are its forests--valuable because of the numerous uses for wood products from forests, unique because this resource is renewable. As with any resource, forest products must be used efficiently and with foresight.
Progress is being made to utilize this resource more thoroughly. Forestry research is discovering how to use wood more efficiently in construction; it is finding ways to use all of every log harvested; it is investigating the chemical properties which might be tapped to replace products now made from nonrenewable resources; it is looking into the possibilities of using wood so gasoline and oil supplies can be extended.
Our forests are vast, but we are making strenuous demands on them. With our needs rapidly expanding, there is danger our present forest production will soon be incapable of satisfying the demands made on it. Fortunately, we know our forests can, under proper management, be regrown perpetually at a rate equal to, or even greater than, the rate at which trees are used.
We have much of the knowledge and technology to expand our forests productively. We must dedicate ourselves to expanding our public and private forests as well as to managing better the forest lands we now have. This requires the close cooperation of business, industry, government and the individual citizen. A giant step was taken with the passage in 1974 of the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act. It requires an assessment of our present and potential supply and demand for all forest products and preparation of a proposed program to meet future demands. It requires us to plan and act today to meet the needs of tomorrow.
To recognize the importance of forest resources and forest products to the Nation, the Congress has, by joint resolution of September 13, 1960 (74 Stat. 898), designated the seven-day period beginning the third Sunday of October each year as National Forest Products Week, and has

 United Nations Day, 1975

October 13, 1975

By the President of the United States of America,

A Proclamation

59 Stat. 1031.

Each year, throughout the world, nations commemorate October 24 as United Nations Day. This year is the 30th Anniversary of the United Nations Charter. Originally with 51 nations as members, the United Nations today includes 141 nations, thus membership is nearly universal.

The primary purpose of the United Nations is to maintain international peace and security. Had the work of the organization included nothing more than its efforts for peace in the Middle East--through truce observers, emergency forces, and mediation services--it would have justified its existence. But its record of achievement is far greater, and it continues to face new tasks with skill and imagination.

Today, the United Nations is adjusting to the new realities of economic interdependence. At the Seventh Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly in September of this year, great progress was made toward reaching agreements through which the interests of all nations-- less developed as well as developed--can be promoted through coopera-

PROCLAMATION 4400--OCT. 13, 1975

live action. In the field of economic development, as in peacekeeping, the United Nations has proved its usefulness to all its members.

The United Nations also has accelerated its efforts to stress the individual rights of women and the need to use their talents for the progress of society. By its designation of 1975 as "International Women's Year" the United Nations has recognized the importance of women's increasing contributions to the cause of peace and friendly relations among the Nations of the world.

co^mp.^ p^6.^^^'* 1

Many important tasks are still before the United Nations. These include agreements on Law of the Sea, procedures to eliminate torture and efforts to control debilitating diseases. We cannot be satisfied until great progress has been made in these and other areas of international concern.

I ask the American people to look at the United Nations with true perspective--neither exaggerating its accomplishments nor ignoring its shortcomings, but seeing clearly its record and its potential for constructive action in the best interests of the United States and of all other members.

NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, GERALD R. FORD, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Friday, October 24, 1975, as United Nations Day. I urge the citizens of this Nation to observe that day with community programs that will promote the United Nations and its affiliated agencies.

I have appointed H. J. Haynes to be United States National Chairman for United Nations Day and, through him, I call upon State and local officials to encourage citizens' groups and all agencies of communication to engage in appropriate observances of United Nations Day in cooperation with the United Nations Association of the United States of America and other interested organizations.

Drug Abuse Prevention Week, 1975

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
The spread of drug abuse across the country continues to threaten the quality of our national life by destroying individual lives, dividing families and disrupting the social structures of our cities and communities.
The economic cost alone, in terms of lost productivity, narcoticsrelated crime and drug abuse prevention programs, is estimated to be in excess of $10 billion a year. The toll of human suffering is beyond measure.
The Federal Government, with the cooperation of States, municipalities and concerned community groups, has made marked progress in the last six years. Together, we have reduced both the supply and demand for drugs through vigilant law enforcement and humane treatment and rehabilitation programs. But, unfortunately, the prevalence and incidence of drug abuse remains high. Cities which only two years ago were reporting a decline in heroin use are now reporting an increase, and the demand for treatment continues to rise. These signs must be read realistically as clear signals of danger ahead. This danger is of such national significance that we must dedicate ourselves anew to the task of safeguarding the country against the consequences of drug abuse.
An important focus for our effort must be on developing the self-esteem which is the key to preventing drug abuse and other forms of destructive behavior. Prevention programs which address the broad developmental needs of children and youth and which respond to all the favorable social factors that affect young people offer the best promise of helping solve a range of youth problems, including drug abuse.
Successful prevention programs, however, cannot function in isolation. Experience has taught us that in all programs where prevention efforts have been successful, the local community has been a vital part of program planning, management and financial support.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, GERALD R. FORD, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate and proclaim the week beginning October 19, 1975, as Drug Abuse Prevention Week, 1975.

designated week to the prevention of drug abuse in America.

I ask for a coordinated community response in the conduct of drug prevention programs. Where that coordinated response exists, let us reaffirm it, and where it is absent, let us build it.

Country music--that uniquely American art form--holds a special place in our society. Its stories of struggle, of patience, of patriotism, of love won and lost--all set to music as distinctive and eloquently simple as any in the world--give pleasure and inspiration to millions of Americans.

Because country music plays such a significant role in American life, because its stars and its fans alike represent the very heart of America, it is particularly fitting that we as a Nation pay tribute to this very special kind of music. In doing so, we honor the hundreds of talented people who make that music, and the millions more who enjoy it.

National Parkinson Week, 1975

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Of all the illnesses threatening our older citizens, Parkinson's disease is one of the most devastating. One in forty Americans past middle age may be afflicted. The human as well as monetary costs are virtually incalculable.
Ten years ago, when the first proclamation of National Parkinson Week was issued and signed into law, a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease was usually accompanied by advice to the family that little could be done. Today, there is much that can be done, and prospects are steadily improving. Advances in drug treatment have put many disabled workers back on the job and have enabled many retirees to live their normal lives. For some, the change has been a real miracle.
However, the battle is not over. Drugs can control the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, but they do not cure or arrest it. Since the cause is still unknown, prevention is not possible. Scientists are working constantly to find the cause. We must support them so the spectacular research momentum of the past ten years can be sustained.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, GERALD R. FORD, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week of October 26, 1975, as National Parkinson Week. I urge physicians, scientists and government and private agencies concerned with Parkinson's disease to sponsor activities designed to inform every American of the need to continue the struggle and the need of their support.
I invite the Governors of the States and appropriate local government officials to support National Parkinson Week activities, and I urge the Nation's mass communications media to join in encouraging all Americans to heed the message.

Two hundred years ago the frontier colonies of America braced for a long and determined conflict with the strongest military power in the world. The petition of our Founding Fathers for redress of their grievances had been rejected by King and Parliament, and the people of America began the struggle from which emerged this great Nation.
Our Nation is the oldest continuously surviving republic in the world. For 200 years our freedoms have been questioned, challenged, tested and reinforced. These freedoms have shaped our destiny and served as a beacon to other peoples. Our Nation draws its strength from people of every creed, of every color, of every race--native Americans and people from every nation in the world who for two centuries have come to share in the rewards and responsibilities of our American Republic.
On the eve of our 200th year. Thanksgiving Day should be a day of special reflection upon the qualities of heart, mind and character of the men and women who founded and built our great Nation.

For many years, physicians and health professionals have urged improved national services and facilities for emergency medical care.

PROCLAMATION 4407--NOV. 4, 1975

89 STAT. 1313

This growth has firmly established an interdependence between farm and city, which is greater today than it was two hundred years ago. Although farmers and ranchers comprise less of our population than in the past, their production of food has more than kept pace with our fundamental needs. This capability to produce our plentiful food supply is, in turn, dependent upon the efforts of those in urban centers to provide the goods and services which our farmers and ranchers need.
It is appropriate to remember and renew our understanding of this continuing partnership between farm and city. Only out of this working partnership will our country achieve new abundance and prosperity in the future.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, GERALD R. FORD, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the period November 21 through November 27, 1975, as National Farm-City Week.
I request interested persons to join with agricultural organizations, business and labor groups, youth and community groups, schools and others to focus attention upon the interrelationships which exist among the constructive labors of all individuals, whether on the farm or in the city.
I urge the Department of Agriculture, educational institutions and other organizations and governmental agencies and officials to mark the significance of National Farm-City Week with special study, public meetings, exhibits and other appropriate activities in the public interest.

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
As the United States of America looks forward to the two hundredth anniversary of our Nation's independence next July, it is appropriate that we pause and reflect on the principles of self-government that underlie our society and continue to nourish it.
Embodied in our great national documents--the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights--are the imperishable ideas that all men are created equal, that they are endowed with unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, and that it is the people of the United States themselves who have ordained and established the government which serves us all.
The Founding Fathers could not foresee in detail the threats to liberty that might arise as the Republic grew, but they had the wisdom to know that threats would appear and that the people must be protected against them. When the new Constitution was being discussed in 1787, Thomas Jefferson complained in a letter to James Madison of the absence of a Bill of Rights, saying: "Let me add that a bill of rights is what the people arc entitled to against every government on earth, general or particular; and what no just government should refuse, or rest on inferences."
Madison became convinced of the need for a Bill of Rights and wrote Jefferson: "The political truths declared in that solemn manner acquire by degrees the character of fundamental maxims of free government, and as they become incorporated with the National saitiment, counteract the impulses of interest and passion." In the First Congress, Madison, the principal proponent of those amendments to the Constitution known as the Bill of Rights, defended them in these words: "If they are incorporated into the constitution, independent tribunals of justice will consider themselves in a peculiar manner the guardians of those rights; they will be an impenetrable bulwark against every assumption of power in the legislative or executive. . . ."
This has truly been our national experience. So also in the international community have we come to respect and rely on the Universal Declara-

PROCLAMATION 4409--NOV. 10, 1975

89 STAT. 1315

tion of Human Rights as a fundamental statement of principles reaffirming faith in the dignity and worth of the human person and in the equal rights of men and women as the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world.
On December 15 we mark the one hundred eighty-fourth anniversary of the adoption of the Bill of Rights and on December 10 we observe the twenty-seventh anniversary of the Universal Declaration. It Is fitting that in 1975, which is International Women's Year, we should recognize especially the contributions of women to political and social progress and underline our commitment to remove promptly such barriers that still remain in the way of their full participation in our Nation's life.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, GERALD R. FORD, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim December 10, 1975, as Human Rights Day and December 15, 1975, as Bill of Rights Day. I call upon the American people to observe the week beginning December 10, 1975, as Human Rights Week. Further, I urge all Americans during the coming bicentennial year to contemplate the principles of lil)erty and justice enunciated in the Bill of Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and to draw on them as the best means to assure our Nation's continued progress.
IN WITNESS W H E R E O F , I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundredth.

Proclamation 4409



November 10, 1975

American Education Week, 1975

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Our schools are no better than we make them. They can provide a solid educational foundation for our children. They can provide a training ground for leadership development. They can offer an opportunity for expanded technical knowledge and cultural enrichment through con-

89 STAT. 1316

PROCLAMATION 4409--NOV. 10, 1975

tinued education. They can become a center for community involvement. But the future our schools provide is in large measure dependent upon our involvement.
We must be concerned for our sake, for our children's sake and for the future of our Republic. This Nation's greatness depends upon the enlightenment of each generation.
Although we can be justly proud of our system of American education, we must not become complacent. What we teach our children in school and what adults continue to learn through advanced courses and community educational opportunities will affect our own future--and our Nation's future.
It is particularly appropriate, therefore, as we celebrate our 200 years of history, to emphasize the importance of American education in the lives of every American.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, GERALD R. FORD, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning November 16, 1975, as American Education Week.
I urge parents to visit their children's schools, to learn what their children are learning and to join with teachers and administrators in providing an enriching environment for their children's educational experience.
I urge all students to recognize the unique opportunity they have in this great Republic to reach out for greater knowledge and deeper understanding of man and his environment.
I urge students, teachers and administrators to plan appropriate activities which encourage participation in student government.
I urge everyone, either informally or in the classroom setting, to take advantage of the growing opportunities for adult education in technical skills, employment skills and cultural and intellectual pursuits.
During American Education Week, I urge every American to recommit himself to the process of continuing education for every man, woman and child.
IN WITNESS W H E R E O F , I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundredth.
GERALD R . FORD

TABLE OF LAWS AFFECTED IN
VOLUME 89

LAWS AFFECTED IN VOLUME 89
EXPLANATION
General. The following table is designed to serve as a guide to prior laws which are patently amended, repealed, or otherwise affected by the textual provisions of t h e public laws and proclamations contained in this volume. This table is arranged chronologically. In preparing the table the "basic act" principle h a s been followed. Under this principle t h e key listing of amendatory legislation will be found under the basic act affected, rather than under intervening amendments thereto. Furthermore, all laws included are t r e a t e d as if tables covering prior volumes of t h e United States Statutes at Large were in existence. Thus no attempt is made to give an historical picture of a law, and only t h e latest amendment in t h e chain will be reflected. Occasionally, to promote clarity, cross references have been supplied at key points. Users of t h e table should, therefore, look under t h e date, public law number, or s t a t u t e s volume and page number of t h e basic act affected, in order to determine whether changes have been made by the public laws and proclamations contained in this volume. Although^ a given section of any act may have been added at a later date, the section is carried under the date and statutes citation of the basic act. For this reason the page numbers in the column headed " S t a t u t e s volume and page" are t h e numbers of t h e page on which each act begins. The "Comment" column describes t h e n a t u r e of the affecting action. These are editorial comments, intended to reflect what is patent in the laws reviewed, and every effort has been made to avoid interpretations. From time to time the annual tables will be cumulated and made separately available as a convenience to users. The most recent cumulation is the Laws Affected Tables for 1956-1970, Volumes 70-84, United States Statutes at Large.
Caveat.
This table is editorially compiled and presented as a reference guide only. Hence it has no evidentiary status or legal effect. Indirect or implied relationships are not included. These may be found t h r o u g h use of t h e Subject Index or through research based on the text itself.
Note.
Volumes 71 t h r o u g h 86 of t h e United States S t a t u t e s at Large included additional tables of amendments and other affecting actions for special groups of materials such as Revised S t a t u t e s , I n t e r n a l Revenue Codes, positive law titles of t h e United States Code, etc. Other tables listed broad

repeals of unspecified provisions and prior laws which were simply referred to in the text. Because of their limited usefulness and the existence in some cases of other research aids for these materials, former tables 2-19 have been discontinued.
The Office of the Federal Register invites criticisms or suggestions as to the usefulness of this finding aid.
