BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

A PROCLAMATION

WHEREAS, a North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement between the United States of America, Canada, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Mexico , was signed by their respective plenipotentiaries at Habana on December 13, 1937, a true copy of which agreement as certified by the Undersecretary of State of Cuba, in the English, Spanish and French languages is in words and figures as follows:
NORTH AMERICAN REGIONAL BROADCASTING AGREEMENT Post, p, 1398.
concluded among the following Governments :
Canada Cuba Dominican Republic Haiti Mexico United States of America
The undersigned, plenipotentiaries of the Governments listed above , having met in conference at Habana, Cuba , have, in common agreement and subject to ratification , concluded the following Agreement .
PURPOSE AND SCOPE OF THIS AGREEMENT
1. Purpose of Agreement. The purpose of this Agreement is to regulate and establish principles covering the use of the standard broadcast band in the North American Region so that each country may make the most effective use thereof with the minimum technical interference between broadcast stations .
2. North American Region . The North American Region (hereinafter referred to as "Region ") for the purpose of this Agreement shall
1005

1006

TREATIES

[55 STAT.

be deemed to include and to consist of the following countries : Canada , Cuba, Dominican Republic, Haiti , Mexico , Newfoundland, and United States of America .
3. Standard broadcast band. The standard broadcast band shall be deemed to be the band of frequencies extending from 550 to 1600 kc, both inclusive, both 550 kc and 1600 kc being the carrier frequencies of broadcasting channels as hereinafter defined . The Governments St4a9t. 1S4t2a9t. . 2453; 54 agree, subject to the provisions of Article 7 of the General Radio Regulations annexed to the International Telecommunications Convention , Madrid , 1932 , that this band of frequencies shall be allocated exclusively to broadcasting in the Region .
4. Sovereign right to use channels . The sovereign right of all countries, parties to this Agreement, to the use of every channel in the standard broadcast band is recognized . The Governments recognize , however, that until technical developments reach a state permitting the elimination of radio interference of international character, a regional arrangement between them is necessary in order to promote standardization and to minimize interference .
5. Regional character of Agreement. The Governments recognize that this Agreement, and each provision thereof, is a regional arrangement within the meaning of, and authorized by the International St4a9t.St1a41t7. .2391 , 2445; 54 Telecommunications Convention and the General Radio Regulations annexed thereto.

A. DEFINITIONS

TECHNICAL

1. Broadcast station. A station the emissions of which are primarily intended to be received by the general public .
2. Broadcast channels- 550 to 1600 kc . A broadcast channel is a band of frequencies ten ( 10) kc in width, with the carrier frequency at the center. Channels shall be designated by their assigned carrier frequencies. Carrier frequencies assigned to broadcast stations shall begin at 550 kc and be in successive steps of 10 kc . No intermediate frequency shall be assigned as the carrier frequency of any broadcast station .
3. Service areas. (a) Primary service area. The primary service area of a broad-
cast station is the area in which the ground wave is not subject to objectionable interference or objectionable fading.
(b) Secondary service area. The secondary service area of a broadcast station is the area served by the sky wave and not subject to objectionable interference. The signal is subject to intermittent variations in intensity.
4. Dominant stations . A " dominant" station is a Class I station, as hereinafter defined , operating on a clear channel .
5. Secondary station . A " secondary" station is any station except a Class I station operating on a clear channel.

55 STAT. ] NORTH AMERICAN- REGIONAL BROADCASTING - DEC. 13, 1937

6. Objectionable interference. Objectionable interference is the

degree of interference produced when, at a specified boundary or field

intensity contour with respect to the desired station, the field intensity

of an undesired station (or the root-mean-square value of field inten-

sities of two or more stations on the same frequency) exceeds for ten (10) percent or more of the time the values hereinafter set forth in this Agreement.

7. Power. The power of a radio transmitter is the power supplied

to the antenna. The power in the antenna of a modulated-wave

transmitter shall be expressed in two numbers, one indicating the

power of the carrier frequency supplied to the antenna, and the other

the actual maximum percentage of modulation.

8. Spurious radiation. A spurious radiation from a transmitter is

any radiation outside the frequency band of emission normal for the

type of transmission employed, including any harmonic modulation products, key clicks, parasitic oscillations and other transient effects .

9. English, French and Spanish equivalents . It is agreed that , as used in this Agreement, the French and Spanish words below set

forth are respectively the equivalent of, and mean the same as, the English terms opposite which they appear:

English Clear channel

French Frequence libre

Spanish Canal despejado

Objectionable interference Brouillage nuisible Interferencia objetable

B. CLASSES OF CHANNELS AND ALLOCATION THEREOF

1. Three classes: The 106 channels in the standard broadcast band are divided into three principal classes : clear, regional and local .
2. Clear channel: A clear channel is one on which the dominant station or stations render service over wide areas and which are cleared of objectionable interference, within their primary service areas and over all or a substantial portion of their secondary service areas.
3. Regional channel: A regional channel is one on which several stations may operate with powers not in excess of 5 kw. The primary service area of a station operating on any such channel may be limited , as a consequence of interference, to a given field intensity contour.
4. Local channel : A local channel is one on which several stations may operate with powers not in excess of 250 watts. The primary service area of a station operating on any such channel may be limited , as a consequence of interference, to a given field intensity contour.
5. Number of channels of each class: The number of channels of each class shall be as follows:

8. Priority of use of clear channels by countries. (a) The clear channels are assigned for priority of use by Class I
and II stations in the several countries in accordance with the table
set forth in Appendix I. (b) Each such channel shall be used in a manner conforming to the
best engineering practice with due regard to the service to be rendered by the dominant stations operating thereon , as set forth elsewhere in this Agreement . If, for one year within the term of this Agreement, a country fails to make any use of a clear channel assigned to it, the channel shall be considered open for use by the other countries , parties to this Agreement, pursuant to such arrangement as may be agreed upon by their respective administrations and without any necessity for revision of this Agreement.
(c) No country to which a clear channel has been thus assigned shall permit, or agree to permit, any other country to use such channel in a manner not in conformity with this Agreement without first giving
a sixty days advance notice of its intention so to do to all other coun-
a tries, partics to this Agreement . If during this period of sixty days * any other country shall present objections to such proposed use of the channel, the country to which the clear channel has been assigned shall not permit, or agree to permit, such proposed use until the difference presented by the objection has been amicably resolved .
(d) If within the period of this Agreement the country to which a clear channel has been assigned shall have made use of the channel but not in the manner above prescribed or not to the extent required by the provisions of this Agreement, such country shall be considered as

having relinquished that portion of the rights which it has not used and at the expiration of this Agreement the other countries party thereto shall have the right , if they see fit, to withdraw the unused privileges from such country and to reassign them to any or all of the other interested countries.
C. CLASSES OF STATIONS AND USE OF THE SEVERAL CLASSES OF CHANNELS .
1. Classes of stations. Broadcast stations are divided into four principal classes, to be designated Class I , Class II , Class III , and Class IV, respectively.
2. Definitions of classes. The four classes of broadcast stations are defined as follows:
Class I: A dominant station operating on a clear channel and designed to render primary and secondary service over an extended area and at relatively long distances. Class I stations are subdivided into two classes :
Class I-A: A Class I station which operates with power of 50 kw or more and which has its primary service area, within the limits of the country in which the station is located , free from objectionable interference from other stations on the same and adjacent channels, and its secondary service area, within the same limits , free from objectionable interference from stations on the same channel, in accordance with the engineering standards hereinafter set forth.
Class I-B: A Class I station which operates with power of not less than 10 kw or more than 50 kw and which has its primary service area free from objectionable interference from other stations on the same and adjacent channels and its secondary service area free from objectionable interference from stations on the same channel , in accordance with the engineering standards hereinafter set forth .
(a) When two Class I -B stations on the same channel are separated by a distance of 2800 miles or more , neither station shall be required to install a directional antenna.
(b) When two Class I-B stations on the same channel are separated by a distance of more than 1800 miles and less than 2800 miles, it will , in the absence of proof to the contrary, be assumed that each station is free of objectionable interference caused by the other and neither shall be required to install directional antennas or take other precautions to avoid such interference . In case the existence. of objectionable interference is proved, the governments concerned will consult with each other regarding the desirability and practicality of installation of directional antennas or the taking of other precautions to eliminate the interference and will determine by special arrangement the measures, if any, to be taken .
(c) When two Class I-B stations on the same channel are separated by a distance less than 1800 miles, it will, in the absence of proof to the contrary, be assumed that the installation of directional antennas or the taking of other precautions to avoid interference is

1009

1010

TREATIES

[55 STAT.

necessary, and the governments concerned will consult with each other and will take such measures as may be agreed upon between them to the end that the objectionable interference may be reduced or eliminated .
Class II: A " secondary" station which operates on a clear channel and is designed to render service over a primary service area which, depending on geographical location and power used , may be relatively large, but which is limited by and subject to such interference as may be received from Class I stations. A station of this class shall operate
with power of not less than 0.25 kw or more than 50 kw. Whenever necessary a Class II station shall use a directional antenna or other
means to avoid interference , in accordance with the engineering standards hereinafter set forth, with Class I stations and with other Class II stations .
Class III: A station which operates on a regional channel and is designed to render service primarily to a metropolitan district and the rural area contained therein and contiguous thereto . Class III stations are subdivided into two classes:
Class III-A: A Class III station which operates with power not less than one kilowatt or more than five kilowatts and the service area of which is subject to interference in accordance with the engineering standards hereinafter set forth .
Class III-B: A Class III station which operates with a power not less than 0.5 kw or more than 1 kw night and 5 kw daytime and the service area of which is subject to interference in accord with the engineering standards hereinafter set forth.
Class IV: A station using a local channel and designed to render service primarily to a city or town and the suburban and rural areas contiguous thereto . The power of a station of this class shall not be less than 0.1 kw or more than 0.25 kw and its service area is subject to interference in accord with the engineering standards hereinafter set forth .
3. Change of class . If a station or stations in Class III-B located in any country can, through the use of directional antennas or otherwise, so reduce the interference caused or received by such station or stations to the field contour to which interference to stations in Class III-A is allowed, such station or stations shall automatically be classified and included in Class III-A and shall thereafter be so recognized and treated by the Administrations of all countries within the Region.
4. Use ofclear channels. (a) In principle and subject only to the exception hereinafter
set forth, Class I stations shall be assigned only to clear channels . (b) Class II stations may be assigned to clear channels only on
condition that objectionable interference will not be caused to any Class I stations . Where any country has priority of use of a clear channel for any Class I-A station , no other country shall assign any Class II station to that channel for nighttime operation (from sunset to sunrise at the location of the Class II station) unless such Class II station is located not less than 650 miles from the nearest border of the country

55 STAT. ] NORTH AMERICAN- REGIONAL BROADCASTING- DEC. 13, 1937

1011

in which the Class I-A station is located ; provided , however, that where an assignment for a Class II station is specifically stated in Appendix I, such assignment shall be deemed as authorized under the limitations therein set forth .
5. Use ofregional channels . (a) In general only Class III-A and Class III-B stations shall be
assigned to regional channels. (b) On condition that interference be not caused to any Class
III-A or Class III-B station , and subject to such interference as may be received from Class III-A or Class III-B stations, Class IV stations may be assigned to regional channels .
(c) Because of their geographical location with respect to the North American continent, special consideration will be given to the use by Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Newfoundland of stations of Classes I and II assigned to certain regional channels under certain conditions , with respect to power and precautions to avoid objectionable interference as set forth in Appendix VII .
6. Use of local channels . Only Class IV stations shall be assigned to local channels .

Post, p. 1020. Post, p. 1034.

D. SERVICE AND INTERFERENCE

1. Satisfactory signal. It is recognized that , in the absence of interference from other stations and in regions where the natural electrical noise level is not abnormally high, a signal of 100 microvolts per meter constitutes a usable signal in rural and sparsely settled areas but that, because of the higher electrical noise levels in more thickly populated communities, greater field intensities (ranging as high as 25 millivolts or more in cities) are necessary to render satisfactory service . It is further recognized that it is not possible to accord protection to stations from objectionable interference over the entire areas over which their signals are or may be above the electrical noise level, particularly at night , and that it is necessary to specify boundaries or contours at or within which stations are protected from objectionable interference from other stations.
2. Areas protected from objectionable interference. The boundaries or contours at and within which the several classes of stations shall be protected from objectionable interference are as set forth in Appendix II. No station, however, need be protected from objectionable interference at any point outside the boundaries of the country in which such station is located.
With respect to the root-mean-square values of interfering field intensities referred to herein , it shall be understood to apply in determining the interference between existing stations and no station thereafter assigned the channel shall increase the root-mean-square value of the interfering field intensity above the maxima specified in the attached tables.
3. Objectionable interference on the same channel. Objectionable interference shall be deemed to exist to a station when, at the boundary
or field intensity contour specified in Appendix II with respect to the

Post, p. 1024. Post, p. 1024.

1012 Post, p. 1024.
Post, p. 1025.

TREATIES

[55 STAT.

class to which the station belongs, the field intensity of an interfering

station (or the root-mean-square value of the field intensities of two or more interfering stations) operating on the same channel, exceeds for ten ( 10) percent or more of the time the value of the permissible

interfering signal set forth opposite such class in Appendix II . 4. Interference to dominant clear channel stations. A station shall
be considered as not capable of causing objectionable interference to a Class I clear channel station on the same frequency when it is separated from the dominant clear channel station by a difference of 70 degrees or more of longitude .
5. Objectionable interference on adjacent channels . It is recognized, in principle, that objectionable interference may be caused to a desired station when , at or within the specified contours of a desired station , the field intensity of the ground wave of an undesired station operating on an adjacent channel (or the root-mean-square value of the field intensities of two or more such undesired stations operating on the same adjacent channel) exceeds a value determined by the

following ratio:

Separation between channels
10 kc 20 kc 30 kc

Minimum permissible ratio of desired to undesired signals
1 to 0.5 1 to 10 1 to 50

For convenient reference , the maximum permissible values of interfering signals on such adjacent channels at specified contours are set forth in Appendix III , Table I.
6. Application of standards to existing stations. (a) For the purpose of estimating objectionable interference,
all stations (other than those of Class II ) shall be assumed to use the maximum power permitted to their respective classes . In this connection, the power of Class I-A stations shall be considered to be 50 kw or the actual power, if higher.
(b) After this agreement has been placed in operation a station thereafter assigned a channel already assigned to other stations shall not be considered as preventing existing stations from increasing their power to the maximum allowed their class, even though such power increase may limit the newly assigned station to a field intensity contour of higher value than that permitted its class.
7. Frequency stability The operating frequency of each broadcast station shall be maintained to within 50 cycles of the assigned frequency until January 1 , 1939, and thereafter the frequency of each new station or each station where a new transmitter is installed shall be maintained within 20 cycles of the assigned frequency, and after January 1 , 1942 , the frequency of all stations shall be maintained within 20 cycles of the assigned frequency.
8. Spurious radiation . The governments shall endeavor to reduce and, if possible, eliminate spurious radiations from broadcast stations . Such radiations shall be reduced in all cases until they are not of
sufficient intensity to cause interference outside the frequency band

55 STAT. ] NORTH AMERICAN- REGIONAL BROADCASTING- DEC. 13, 1937

required for the type of emission employed. With respect to type A-3 emissions (radio-telephony ) the transmitter should not be modulated in excess of its modulation capability to the extent that interfering spurious radiations occur, and, with respect to amplitude modulation, the operating percentage of modulation should not be less than seventy-five (75 ) percent on peaks of frequent recurrence . Means should be employed to insure that the transmitter is not modulated in excess of its modulation capability.
E. DETERMINATION OF PRESENCE OF OBJECTIONABLE INTERFERENCE

1. Antenna performance. For the purpose of calculating the presence and the degree of objectionable interference, stations of the several classes shall be assumed to produce effective field , corrected for absorption, for one kilowatt of input power to the antenna, as follows :

Class of Station I
II and III IV

At One Mile 225 mv/m 175 mv/m 150 mv/m

At One Kilometer 362 mv/m 282 mv/m 241 mv/m

In case a directional antenna is employed , the interfering signal of a broadcasting station will vary in different directions. To determine the interference in any direction, in the absence of actual interference measurements, the horizontal and vertical field intensity patterns of the directional antenna must be calculated and by comparing the appropriate vectors in the horizontal or vertical pattern with that of a nondirectional with the same effective field, the interfering signal toward any other station can be expressed in terms of kilowatts. This rating in kilowatts shall be applied in the use of mileage separation tables or in computing distances from the propagation curves or tables .
2. Power. The power of a station shall, for the purposes of notifications required by this Agreement, be determined in one of the following manners :
(a) By taking the product of the square of the antenna current and the antenna resistance (antenna input power).
(b) By determination of the station's effective field intensity, corrected for absorption, by making sufficient field intensity measurements on at least eight radials as nearly equally spaced as practicable and by relating the field intensity thus determined to the effective field intensity of a station having the antenna efficiency stipulated above for its class .
3. Methods of determining the presence of objectionable interferenceGeneral. The existence or absence of objectionable interference from stations on the same or adjacent channels shall be determined by one of the following methods:
(a) By actual measurements obtained in the method hereinafter prescribed ; or, with the mutual consent of the countries concerned :

[55 STAT.

Post, pp. 1026, 1027. Post, p. 1028.

(b) By reference to the propagation curves in Appendices IV and V , or
(c) By reference to the distance tables set forth in Appendix VI .

4. Actual proof of existence or absence of objectionable interference. The existence or absence of objectionable interference may be proved by field intensity measurements or recordings made with suitable

apparatus , duly calibrated, by Government engineers or other

engineers as may be mutually acceptable to the Governments con-

cerned. Such field intensity measurements shall be made in the

manner and for the periods of time mutually agreed upon by the Governments concerned .

The contracting Governments agree to facilitate the making of the measurements by requiring the stations involved to remain

silent or operate in the manner deemed necessary, and at such times as not to interrupt regular schedules .
5. Proof based on propagation curves and distance tables.

Post, p. 1027.

(a) Sky wave curves . In computing the distance to the 50 per cent sky wave field intensity contour of a Class I station of a given power, and also in computing the 10 percent sky wave field intensity of an alleged interfering station , of any class and given power, at a specified distance, use may be made of the appropriate graphs set forth in Appendix V, entitled "Average Sky Wave Field Intensity Corresponding to the Second Hour after Sunset in the Recording Station, 100 Millivolt per Meter at One Mile (161 at one kilometer) ".
(b) Ground wave curves . The distance to any specified ground

wave field intensity contour may be determined from appropriate ground wave curves plotted for the frequency under consideration and the conductivity and dielectric constant of the earth between the station and desired contour. The frequency and the conductivity of the earth must be considered in every case and where the distance

Post. p. 1026.

is great due allowance must be made for loss due to curvature of the earth . A family of curves is necessary for this purpose. A graph for a conductivity of 10-13 is set forth in Appendix IV , entitled "Ground Wave Field Intensity vs. Distance for One Kilowatt Radiated From

Short Antenna" . Three frequencies in the standard broadcast band

are given. For other frequencies and soil conditions (conductivity and dielectric constant) other curves are required . A conductivity of 10-13 is considered average and is used throughout in determining the ground wave value for computing the mileage separation tables.
(c) Distance tables. Table I shows the required day separation in miles between broadcast stations on the same channel. Table

II gives the required distance in miles from the boundary of a country in which a Class I-A station is located for the daytime operation of a

Class II station on the same channel in another country . Table III gives the required separation in miles between broadcast stations

Post, p. 1028.

on adjacent channels during both daytime and nighttime. Table IV gives the required night separation in miles between broadcast stations operating on the same channel . The assumed conditions of operation are given in Appendix VI.

55 STAT. ] NORTH AMERICAN- REGIONAL BROADCASTING-DEC. 13, 1937

1015

The tables are based upon the use of nondirectional antennas but, in case a directional antenna is employed at a particular station, it will be necessary to consider the radiation distribution of the directional antenna involved and to modify the mileage separation accordingly. The night separation tables for stations on the same frequency are computed from the skywave curve given in Appendix V. These curves are based on extensive measurements of the skywave produced by broadcasting stations and shall be considered as accurate in all cases unless proof to the contrary is available as set out in Section E 4. The mileage separation tables for the same channel during daytime and for adjacent channels day and night are computed from the groundwave curve in Appendix IV . Tables apply only in case the frequency is 1000 kc and the assumed soil conductivity and dielectric constant prevail . Since these values vary in every case the tables for daytime and adjacent channel separation cannot be used except as a general guide . In any case under consideration an estimate of the mileage separation required may be made from the operating frequency and known or assumed soil conditions . To determine the interference accurately, measurements must be made in accordance with Section E 4 on the frequency under consideration or on another frequency and from the curves the values may be determined for the desired frequency.

TABLE VI

SPECIAL CONDITIONS AFFECTING THE UNITED STATES

The 24 Class I and II stations in the United States which use clear channels with other countries party to this agreement are given in Tables III and IV .

The remaining 39 Class I and II stations of the United States will be assigned the following clear channels :

640 650 660 670 680 700 820 830 840 850 870 880 1120 1160 1180 1200 1210

55 STAT.] NORTH AMERICAN-REGIONAL BROADCASTING- DEC. 13, 1937
It is recognized that the United States must make extensive adjustments in the assignments of its existing stations in order to make possible the carrying out of this Agreement, that these adjustments will require approximately a year, and that it is not possible for the United States at this time to specify on which of the said 32 channels it will have priority of use for Class I-A stations , Class I-B stations and Class II stations respectively , nor the locations of such stations, power and other information with respect thereto . The United States may assign Class I-A stations to at least 25 of said channels. The United States agrees that ninety days before the effective date of this Agreement it will communicate this information to each of the other countries parties to this Agreement, and such information, when communicated , shall be considered part of this Agreement as if fully set forth herein .
Nothing stated in this Agreement shall be construed to preclude the United States of America from asserting, and enjoying recognition of, priority of use with reference to certain other Class II stations (not included in the 63 stations mentioned in Table I) which are now in actual operation in the band 640-1190 kcs and which are known under the Regulations of the Federal Communications Commission as "limited time stations" and "daytime stations" (having hours of operation limited to sunset taken either at their respective locations or at the locations of the respective dominant stations on clear channels and in some cases including hours not actually used by said dominant stations) which stations may , so far as permitted by the terms of this Agreement and the engineering standards herein set forth, be given assignments substantially equivalent to those they now enjoy.
TABLE VII
SPECIAL CONDITIONS REGARDING THE USE OF 1010 KC BY CUBA AND CANADA
With regard to the use of the clear channel of 1010 kc by a Class I-A station in Canada, and by a Class I -B station in Cuba, both countries mutually agree that the interfering signal shall not exceed for 10 per cent of the time or more the value of 50 microvolts per meter at the following points of measurement: in Cuba at any point east of the province of Camaguey, and in Canada at any point west of the province of Manitoba .
TABLE VIII
SPECIAL CONDITIONS AFFECTING CANADA
Nothing stated in this Agreement shall be construed to preclude Canada from asserting priority of use with reference to certain Class III and IV stations now in operation in Canada on existing clear and regional channels which through this Agreement will become of a class of channel which may not permit their use by Class III and IV stations .

· In accordance with other provisions in this Agreement this freedom of interference does not apply outside the boundaries of the country in which the station is located.
· From other stations on same channel only. For adjacent channels see Appendix III, Table I. · Sky wave field intensity exceeded for 10% of the time.
No Class II station shall be assigned to the same channel as a Class I A station for nighttime operation (from sunset to sunrise) less than 650 miles of the nearest border of the country in which the Class I A station is located.
These values are with respect to interference from all stations except Class I, which stations may cause interference to a field intensity contour of higher value. However, it is recommended that Class II stations be so located that the interference received from Class I stations will not exceed these values. If the
Class II stations are limited by Class I stations to higher values, then such values shall be the standard established with respect to interference from all other classes of stations.

CONVENIO REGIONAL NORTEAMERICANO DE RADIODIFUSION,
celebrado entre los Gobiernos que a continuación se expresan : Canadá, Cuba, Estados Unidos de América, Haiti , México y la República Dominicana .
Los infrascritos , Plenipotenciarios de los Gobiernos arriba mencionados , reunidos en conferencia en la Habana, Cuba, han celebrado , de común acuerdo , el siguiente Convenio que requiere la previa ratificación de los Gobiernos respectivos .
I
FINALIDAD Y ALCANCE DE ESTE CONVENIO.
1. Objeto del Convenio . El objeto de este Convenio es reglamentar y establecer los principios relativos al uso de la banda normal de radiodifusión en la Región Norteamericana, de modo que cada pais pueda utilizarla de la manera más efectiva y con la menor interferencia técnica posible entre las estaciones difusoras .
2. Región Norteamericana. Se entenderá que la región Norteamericana (que en lo sucesivo se denominará "la Región ") para los efectos del presente Convenio comprende a, y consiste de , los siguientes países : Canadá, Cuba, Estados Unidos de América, Haiti , México , Terranova y la República Dominicana.
3. Banda normal de radiodifusión. Se entenderá que la banda normal de radiodifusión es la banda de frecuencias que se extiende desde los 550 a los 1600 kc . ambos inclusive , siendo tanto los 550 kc . como los 1600 kc . frecuencias portadoras de canales de radiodifusión , según más adelante se definen . Los Gobiernos convienen en que esta banda de frecuencias se asignará exclusivamente a la radiodifusión en la Región, sujetándose siempre a las disposiciones del Articulo 70. del Reglamento General de Radiocomunicaciones anexo a la Convención Internacional de Telecomunicaciones (Madrid , 1932 ) .
4. Derecho soberano al uso de los canales . Se reconoce el derecho soberano que asiste a todos los países que son partes de este Convenio para usar todos los canales en la banda normal de radiodifusión . Los Gobiernos reconocen, sin embargo , que entretanto los adelantos técnicos alcancen un grado tal que permita la eliminación de las interferencias de radio de carácter internacional, es necesario un arreglo regional entre ellos con objeto de fomentar la normalización y reducir a un minimo las interferencias.
5. Carácter regional del Convenio . Los Gobiernos reconocen que este Convenio y cada una de sus disposiciones, tienen el carácter de

un arreglo regional tal como se entiende y queda autorizado en la Convención Internacional de Telecomunicaciones y el Reglamento General de Radiocomunicaciones anexo a ella.

A. DEFINICIONES .

II TECNICA

1. Estación difusora . Aquella estación cuyas emisiones están principalmente destinadas a ser recibidas por el público en general .
2. Canales de radiodifusión- 550 a 1600 kc. Un canal de radiodifusión es una banda de frecuencias de diez ( 10 ) kc . de ancho , con la frecuencia portadora al centro . Los canales se designarán por sus frecuencias portadoras asignadas . Las frecuencias portadoras asignadas a las estaciones difusoras comenzarán en 550 kc . y continuarán en etapas sucesivas de 10 kc . No se asignará, como frecuencia portadora de una estación de radio difusión , ninguna frecuencia intermedia entre los valores de las etapas sucesivas de 10 kc .
3. Areas de servicio . (a) Area de servicio primario. El área de servicio primario de
una estación difusora es aquélla en que la onda terrestre no está sujeta a interferencia o desvanecimiento objetables .
(b) Area de servicio secundario. El área de servicio secundario de una estación difusora es aquélla dentro de la cual se presta el servicio por medio de la onda reflejada y que no está sujeta a interferencia objetable. La señal es susceptible de sufrir variaciones intermitentes de intensidad.
4. Estación dominante. Es una estación de Clase I, tal como se define a continuación , que funciona en un canal despejado .
5. Estación secundaria. Es cualquiera estación , excepción hecha de las de la Clase I, que funciona en un canal despejado .
6. Interferencia objetable. Interferencia objetable es aquel grado de interferencia que resulta cuando el valor de la intensidad de campo de una estación interferente (o la raíz del promedio de los cuadrados de las intensidades de campo de dos o más estaciones en la misma frecuencia) excede , durante el diez ( 10 ) por ciento o más del tiempo , en un límite o contorno de intensidad de campo determinado con respecto a la estación interferida, de los valores fijados en otra parte de este convenio .
7. Potencia. La potencia de un transmisor de radio es la que se suministra a la antena. La potencia en la antena de un transmisor de onda modulada se expresará por dos cifras, una que indique la potencia de la frecuencia portadora suministrada a la antena y otra el porcentaje máximo de modulación realmente empleado.
8. Emisiones espurias . Emisión espuria de un transmisor es cualquier radiación fuera de la banda normal de emisión para el tipo de transmisión empleado , incluyendo cualquier componente armónico de modulación, impactos de llave, oscilaciones parásitas o cualquier otro fenómeno transitorio .

B. CLASES Y DISTRIBUCION DE CANALES .

1. Tres clases : Los 106 canales en la banda normal de radiodifusión
se dividen en tres clases principales ; despejados , regionales y locales . 2. Canal despejado : Canal despejado es aquél en el que la estación
o estaciones dominantes prestan servicio sobre áreas extensas , teniendo libre de interferencia objetable tanto su área de servicio primario, como la totalidad o gran parte de sus áreas de servicio secundario.
3. Canal regional: Canal regional es aquél en el que pueden operar varias estaciones cuyas potencias no excedan de 5 kw. El área de servicio primario de una estación que funcione en un canal de esta clase podrá quedar limitada, por razón de interferencia, a un contorno determinado de intensidad de campo .
4. Canal local: Canal local es aquél en el que pueden operar varias estaciones cuyas potencias no excedan de 250 vatios . El área de servicio primario de cualquiera estación que ocupe un canal de esta clase podrá quedar limitada , por razón de interferencia , a un contorno determinado de intensidad de campo.

7. Uso de canales regionales y locales por los países . Todos los países podrán usar todos los canales regionales y locales, sujetándose a las limitaciones de potencia y a las normas para prevenir la inter-
ferencia objetable consignadas en este Convenio . 8. Prioridad en el uso de canales despejados por los países. (a) Los canales despejados se asignan para la prioridad en el
uso por estaciones de las Clases I y II en los distintos países , de acuerdo con la tabla contenida en el Apéndice I.
(b) Cada uno de estos canales será usado ajustándose a las mejores prácticas de ingenieria, teniendo en cuenta el servicio que hayan de prestar las estaciones dominantes que en ellos funcionen , según se estipula en otra parte de este Convenio . Si durante el tér-
mino de un año , en el periodo de vigencia de este Convenio , un país no hiciere uso alguno de un canal despejado que le hubiere sido asignado , dicho canal se considerará libre para ser utilizado por los demás países , partes en este Convenio , de acuerdo con el arreglo que celebren a este respecto las administraciones respectivas y sin necesidad de revisar este Convenio.
(c) Ningún país al cual se haya asignado un canal despejado permitirá, ni convendrá en permitir, a cualquier otro pais que lo use en forma alguna que no esté de acuerdo con las disposiciones de este
a Convenio , sin dar aviso previo de su intención con sesenta dias de anticipación, a todos los demás países participantes en este mismo
a Convenio . Si , durante este periodo de sesenta dias cualquiera otro país hiciere objeciones al uso del canal en la forma propuesta , el país al cual se hubiera asignado el canal despejado no permitirá, ni convendrá en permitir, el uso propuesto , mientras no se hubiere resuelto amigablemente el conflicto a que diere lugar la objeción presentada .
(d) Si, dentro del período de vigencia de este Convenio , el país que tuviere asignado un canal despejado lo hubiere usado pero no en la forma arriba estipulada o en la extensión en que lo exigen las disposiciones de este Convenio , se entenderá que tal país ha renunciado a aquella parte de sus derechos que no hubiere usado y, al vencerse este Convenio, los demás países contratantes tendrán el derecho de retirarle a dicho país, si así lo estimaren conveniente, los privilegios no usados, y asignarlos de nuevo a cualquiera de los demás países interesados, o a todos ellos .

C. CLASES DE ESTACIONES Y USO DE LAS DIVERSAS CLASES DE CANALES.
1. Clases de Estaciones. Las estaciones difusoras se dividen en cuatro clases principales , que se denominarán Clase I, Clase II , Clase III y Clase IV , respectivamente.
2. Definición de las clases. Las cuatro clases de estaciones difusoras se definen como sigue :
· Días comunes, (Naturales) .

55 STAT.] NORTH AMERICAN-REGIONAL BROADCASTING- DEC. 13, 1937
Clase I: Una estación dominante que funciona en un canal despejado y que está destinada a prestar servicios primario y secundario en un área extensa y a distancias relativamente grandes .
Las estaciones de Clase I se subdividen en dos clases : Clase I-A: Una estación de Clase I que trabaja con potencia
de 50 o más kilovatios y cuya área de servicio primario está libre dentro de las fronteras del país donde la estación está ubicada, de interferencia objetable producida por otras estaciones en el mismo canal o en canales adyacentes ; estando asímismo su área de servicio secundario ; dentro de los mismos limites, libre de interferencia objetable producida por estaciones en el mismo canal, de acuerdo con las normas de ingeniería que se establecen más adelante.
Clase I-B: Una estación de Clase I que trabaja con una potencia de no menos de 10 ni más de 50 kw y cuya área de servicio primario está libre de interferencia objetable producida por otras estaciones en el mismo canal y en los canales adyacentes , y cuya área de servicio secundario está asimismo libre de interferencia objetable proveniente de estaciones que operan en el mismo canal, de acuerdo con las normas de ingeniería que se establecen más adelante.
(a) Cuando entre dos estaciones de la Clase I-B, en el mismo canal , medie una distancia de 2,800 millas , o más, no se le exigirá a ninguna de ellas que instale antena direccional .
(b) Cuando entre dos estaciones de la Clase I-B, en el mismo canal medie una distancia mayor de 1800 millas y menor de 2800 , se entenderá, salvo pruebas en contrario , que cada una de dichas estaciones está libre de interferencia objetable producida por la otra, y a ninguna de ellas se le exigirá que instale antenas direccionales o tome precauciones de cualquiera otra índole para evitar tal interferencia. En caso de que se compruebe la existencia de interferencia objetable , los gobiernos interesados se consultarán respecto a la conveniencia y practicabilidad de la instalación de antenas direccionales o de tomar precauciones de otra índole con el objeto de eliminar la interferencia, y determinarán por acuerdo especial las medidas que deban tomarse.
(c) Cuando entre dos estaciones de la Clase I-B, en el mismo canal medie una distancia menor de 1800 millas , se entenderá , salvo
pruebas en contrario , que es necesaria la instalación de antenas direccionales o la adopción de precauciones de otra índole para prevenir la interferencia, y los gobiernos interesados se consultarán y tomarán las medidas en que convengan con el fin de reducir o eliminar la interferencia objetable.
Clase II: Estación "secundaria" que opera en un canal despejado y que está destinada a prestar servicio sobre un área de servicio primario que, si se tiene en cuenta la ubicación geográfica y la potencia usada, puede ser relativamente extensa, pero que está limitada por, y sujeta a la interferencia que le puedan causar las estaciones de la Clase I. Una estación de esta clase funcionará con una potencia no menor de 0.25 kw. ni mayor de 50 kw. Una estación de Clase II utilizará, siempre que sea necesario , antena direccional u otros medios

1039

1040

TREATIES

[55 STAT.

para evitar interferencia con estaciones de la Clase I, o con otras estaciones de la Clase II , de acuerdo con las normas de ingeniería que más adelante se establecen .
Clase III: Estación que opera en un canal regional y que está destinada a prestar servicio principalmente a zonas metropolitanas y a las areas rurales adyacentes y contiguas a ellas. Las estaciones de la clase III se subdividen en dos clases:
Clase III-A: Una estación de la Clase III que trabaja con potencia no menor de 1 kw. ni mayor de 5 kw. y cuya área de servicio está sujeta a sufrir interferencia , de acuerdo con las normas de ingeniería que más adelante se consignan .
Clase III-B: Una estación de la Clase III que trabaja con potencia no menor de 0.5 kw. ni mayor de 1 kw. durante la noche y 5 kw. durante el día, y cuya área de servicio queda sujeta a sufrir interferencia de acuerdo con las normas de ingeniería que más adelante se consignan.-
Clase IV: Una estación que, utilizando un canal local , está destinada a prestar servicio principalmente a una ciudad o población y a las áreas suburbanas y rurales contiguas a ésta . La potencia de una estación de esta clase no será menor de 0.1 kw. ni mayor de 0.25 kw. y su área de servicio está sujeta a sufrir interferencia de acuerdo con las normas de ingeniería que más adelante se consignan .
3.-Cambio de clase: Si una o más estaciones de la Clase III-B
ubicadas en cualquier país pueden , haciendo uso de antenas direccionales o por otros medios, reducir la interferencia causada o recibida por dicha estación o estaciones al contorno de campo en que se permite interferencia a las estaciones de la Clase III-A, tal estación o estaciones quedarán clasificadas e incluídas automáticamente dentro de la Clase III-A, y de allí en adelante las Administraciones de todos los países comprendidos en la Región las reconocerán y tratarán como tales .
4. Uso de canales despejados. (a) En principio , y únicamente con la excepción que más adelante
se estipula , las estaciones de la Clase I se asignarán sólo a canales despejados .
(b) Las estaciones de la Clase II podrán asignarse únicamente a canales despejados , siempre que no se produzca interferencia objetable a ninguna estación de la Clase I. Cuando cualquier país tenga prioridad en el uso de un canal despejado para cualquier estación de la Clase I-A, ningún otro país asignará una estación de la Clase II a ese canal para funcionamiento nocturno (desde la puesta a la salida del sol en la ubicación de la estación de la Clase II ) a menos que tal estación de la Clase II esté situada a no menos de 650 millas de la
frontera más cercana del país en el que esté ubicada la estación de la Clase I-A ; disponiéndose, sin embargo, que en el caso de que se mencione de un modo específico tal asignación en el Apéndice I, se entenderá que la misma ha sido autorizada dentro de las limitaciones
estipuladas en dicho Apéndice .

55 STAT. ] NORTH AMERICAN- REGIONAL BROADCASTING - DEC . 13, 1937
5. Uso de canales regionales . (a) En general , a canales regionales sólo se asignarán estaciones
de las Clases III-A y III-B. (b) Podrán asignarse estaciones de la Clase IV a canales regiona-
les, a condición de que no se produzca interferencia a ninguna estación de las Clases III-A 6 III-B ; quedando , además , la estación de la Clase IV, sujeta a la interferencia que pudiera sufrir de estaciones de las Clases III-A 6 III-B .
(c) Debido a la posición geográfica que ocupan Cuba , la República Dominicana, Haití y Terranova, con respecto al Continente norteamericano, se dará consideración especial al uso que estos países hagan de estaciones de las Clases I y II asignadas a ciertos canales regionales bajo ciertas condiciones, en cuanto a potencia y a precauciones para evitar interferencia objetable según lo dispuesto en el Apéndice VII .
6. Uso de canales locales .- Se asignarán únicamente estaciones de la Clase IV a canales locales .
D. SERVICIO E INTERFERENCIA.
1. Señal satisfactoria. Se acepta que, no habiendo interferencia de otras estaciones y en regiones donde el nivel de ruidos producidos por fenómenos eléctricos naturales no sea anormalmente alto , constituye una señal utilizable la que tenga un valor de 100 microvoltios por metro , dentro de áreas rurales y escasamente pobladas ; pero en las regiones más densamente pobladas , donde son más elevados los niveles de ruidos eléctricos, hay necesidad de intensidades de campo más grandes (que se elevan hasta 25 milivoltios o más dentro de las ciudades ) para que pueda prestarse un servicio satisfactorio . Se reconoce asimismo que no es posible proteger contra interferencia objetable la totalidad de las áreas dentro de las cuales las señales de las estaciones estén o puedan estar sobre el nivel de ruidos eléctricos , particularmente durante la noche ; siendo necesario, por lo tanto , especificar límites o contornos en o dentro de los cuales se protegerán las estaciones contra interferencia objetable producida por otras estaciones .
2. Areas protegidas contra interferencia objetable. En el Apéndice II se establecen los límites o contornos en, o
dentro de los cuales , se protegerán contra interferencia objetable las diversas clases de estaciones . Ninguna estación, sin embargo, necesita ser protegida contra interferencia objetable en ningún punto fuera de las fronteras del país donde se halla ubicada tal estación .
Con respecto a los valores cuadráticos medios de las intensidades de campo interferentes a que se hace referencia en este instrumento , se entenderá que se aplican para determinar la interferencia entre estaciones ya existentes, y ninguna estación a la que se asigne posteriormente el canal deberá producir un aumento en el valor cuadrático medio de la intensidad de campo interferente sobre los máximos especificados en las tablas adjuntas a este instrumento .

1041

1042

TREATIES

[55 STAT.

3. Interferencia objetable en el mismo canal. Se entenderá que existe interferencia objetable a una estación cuando , en los límites o contornos de intensidad de campo especificados en el Apéndice II con respecto a la clase a que pertenece la estación , la intensidad de campo de una estación interferente que opere en el mismo canal (o la raíz del promedio de los cuadrados de las intensidades de campo de dos o más estaciones interferentes ) , excede, durante el diez ( 10 ) por ciento del tiempo , o más , del valor permisible para la señal interferente que se establece para tal clase en el Apéndice II.

4. Interferencia a estaciones dominantes de canal despejado . Se considerará que una estación no es capaz de producir interferencia objetable a una estación de canal despejado de la Clase I , en la misma frecuencia, cuando medie entre ella y la estación dominante de canal

despejado una diferencia de setenta o más grados de longitud. 5. Interferencia objetable en canales adyacentes. Se reconoce , en principio, que puede causarse interferencia
objetable a una estación determinada cuando en , o dentro de , los contornos especificados de dicha estación , la intensidad de campo de la onda terrestre de una estación interferente que opere en un

canal adyacente (o el valor de la raíz del promedio de los cuadrados de las intensidades de campo de dos o más de tales estaciones interferentes que trabajen en el mismo canal adyacente) excede del valor determinado por las siguientes proporciones :

Separación entre canales.
10 kc 20 kc 30 kc

Relación mínima permisible entre las señales interferidas
e interferentes. 1 a 0.5 1 a 10
1 a 50

En el Apéndice III , Tabla I, se consignan los valores máximos permisibles de las señales interferentes en tales canales adyacentes, en determinados contornos , con el objeto de facilitar su consulta.
6. Aplicación de normas a las estaciones existentes . (a) Para poder calcular la interferencia objetable, se consi-
derará que todas las estaciones , salvo las de la Clase II , emplean la potencia máxima permitida a sus clases respectivas . A este respecto , se considerará que la potencia de las estaciones de la Clase I-A es de 50 kilovatios, o la potencia real usada , si fuere superior a 50 kilovatios.
(b) Si, después de que hubiere entrado en vigor este Convenio , se asignare una estación a un canal ya asignado a otras estaciones , no se considerará que ésta nueva asignación impide que las estaciones ya existentes aumenten su potencia hasta el máximo permitido a las de su Clase, aun cuando éste aumento en la potencia pueda limitar a la estación recién asignada a un contorno de intensidad de campo de un valor superior al que se permite a su clase .
7. Estabilidad de frecuencia. Hasta el día 1ro de Enero de 1939 , se mantendrá la frecuencia de funcionamiento de cada estación difusora dentro de un margen de 50 ciclos de la frecuencia asignada ; con posterioridad a dicha fecha, la frecuencia de cada estación nueva,

55 STAT. ] NORTH AMERICAN- REGIONAL BROADCASTING- DEC. 13, 1937

o de cada estación donde se instale un nuevo transmisor , se mantendrá dentro de un margen de 20 ciclos de la frecuencia asignada ; y, después del 1ro de Enero de 1942 , la frecuencia, de todas las estaciones se mantendrá dentro de un margen de 20 ciclos de la frecuencia asignada.
8. Emisiones espurias. Los Gobiernos procurarán reducir y, si fuere posible, eliminar las emisiones espurias de las estaciones difusoras. En todos los casos deberán reducirse tales emisiones al grado de que no tengan suficiente intensidad para producir interferencia fuera de la banda de frecuencias necesaria para el tipo de emisión empleado . Con respecto a las emisiones del tipo A-3 (radiotelefonía ) , no deberá modularse el transmisor en exceso de su capacidad de modulación al grado de que pudieran ocurrir emisiones espurias interferentes , y con respecto a la modulación por amplitud , el tanto por ciento efectivo de modulación no deberá ser menor del setenta y cinco por ciento (75 %) en los máximos de frecuente repetición . Deberán emplearse los medios necesarios para evitar que el transmisor sea modulado en exceso de su capacidad de modulación .

E. DETERMINACION DE LA PRESENCIA DE INTERFERENCIA OBJETABLE.

1. Funcionamiento de la antena. Para poder calcular la presencia

y el grado de interferencia objetable , se considerará que las estaciones

de las diferentes clases producen un campo efectivo , rectificado en

cuanto a absorción , por cada kilovatio de potencia de entrada a la

antena, como sigue: Clase de estación

A una milla

A un kilómetro

I

225 mv/m

362 mv/m

II y III

175 mv/m

282 mv/m

IV

150 mv/m

241 mv/m

En el caso de emplearse una antena direccional, la señal interferente de una estación difusora variará en diferentes direcciones . Para determinar la interferencia en cualquier dirección sin contar con datos de medición efectivos, deberán calcularse las configuraciones de intensidad de campo horizontal y vertical de la antena direccional ; y, comparando los vectores apropiados en la configuración horizontal o vertical con los de una antena no direccional que tenga el mismo campo efectivo, la señal interferente hacia cualquier otra estación podrá expresarse en kilovatios . Este cómputo en kilovatios se aplicará al considerar las tablas de separación en millas o al calcular las distancias por medio de las curvas o tablas de propagación.
2. Potencia. La potencia de una estación se determinará, para las notificaciones requeridas por este Convenio , por uno de los siguientes métodos :
(a) Tomando el producto del cuadrado de la corriente de antena por la resistencia de la misma (potencia de entrada a la antena) .
(b) Determinando la intensidad de campo efectiva de la estación , rectificada en cuanto a absorción, tomando suficientes lecturas de medidas de intensidad de campo , cuando menos en ocho radiales espaciados tan igualmente como sea posible , y relacionando la intensidad de campo así determinada con la intensidad de campo efectiva de una estación que tenga la eficiencia de antena estipulada para su clase .

1043

1044

TREATIES

[55 STAT.

3. Métodos para determinar la presencia de interferencia objetable, en general. La existencia o ausencia de interferencia objetable originada por estaciones en el mismo canal, o en canales adyacentes , se determinará por cualquiera de los métodos siguientes :
(a ) por medio de mediciones efectivas tomadas siguiendo el método que más adelante se establece ; ó , contando con el consentimiento mutuo de los países afectados:
(b) por referencia a las curvas de propagación de los Apéndices IV y V, 6
(c) por referencia a las tablas de distancias que aparecen en el Apéndice VI.
4. Prueba efectiva de la existencia o inexistencia de interferencia objetable. La existencia o inexistencia de interferencia objetable podrá comprobarse por medio de mediciones de intensidad de campo o por registros hechos con aparatos apropiados , debidamente calibrados , por ingenieros del Gobierno u otros ingenieros cuya intervención se acepte por mutuo acuerdo de los Gobiernos interesados . Tales mediciones de la intensidad de campo se harán en la forma, y durante los períodos, que convengan mutuamente los Gobiernos interesados . Los Gobiernos contratantes convienen en facilitar las mediciones exigiendo de las estaciones en cuestión que suspendan su transmisión o que funcionen en la manera y ocasión que se estime necesario , en períodos que no signifiquen la interrupción de sus programas regulares .
5. Testimonios basados en las curvas de propagación y tablas de distancia.
(a) Curvas de la onda reflejada . Al calcular la distancia al contorno de intensidad de campo del 50 por ciento de la onda reflejada de una estación de la Clase I que trabaje con una potencia dada , así como para calcular el 10 por ciento de la intensidad de campo de la onda reflejada de una estación que se considere interferente, de cualquier clase y con determinada potencia, a una distancia especificada, podrán utilizarse las curvas correspondientes que se indican en el Apéndice V, y denominadas "Intensidad de campo media de la onda reflejada correspondiente a la segunda hora después de la puesta del sol en la estación de registro , 100 milivoltios por metro a una milla ( 161 a un kilómetro)".
(b) Curvas de onda terrestre. Se puede determinar la distancia a cualquier contorno especificado de intensidad de campo de onda terrestre valiéndose de las curvas apropiadas de onda terrestre, trazadas con respecto a la frecuencia en cuestión , y a la conductividad y la constante dieléctrica de la tierra entre la estación y el contorno escogido.- Se tomarán en consideración , en cada caso , tanto la frecuencia de transmisión como la conductividad de la tierra y si la distancia fuere grande , deberán tomarse en consideración las pérdidas que ocasiona la curvatura terrestre.- Para este objeto es necesario un grupo de curvas.- En el Apéndice IV se presenta una gráfica para una conductividad de 10-13 bajo el título de "Intensidad de campo de la onda terrestre en relación con la distancia para un kilovatio radiado por una antena corta" .- Se dan tres frecuencias en la banda normal de radiodifusión . Para otras frecuencias y otras condiciones de la

55 STAT. ] NORTH AMERICAN- REGIONAL BROADCASTING- DEC. 13, 1937
tierra, (constante dieléctrica y de conductibilidad ) , se requieren otras curvas.- Se considera como media una conductibilidad de 10-13 , usándose esta constante en todo el proceso para determinar el valor de la onda terrestre en el cálculo de las tablas de separación en términos de millas.-
(c) Tablas de distancia. La Tabla I muestra la separación, en millas, requerida para servicio diurno entre estaciones difusoras que ocupen el mismo canal.- La Tabla II muestra la distancia que se requiere, en millas , desde la frontera de un país en el cual esté ubicada una estación de la Clase I-A, para el funcionamiento diurno , en el mismo canal, de una estación de la Clase II en otro país . La Tabla III indica la separación que se requiere , en millas, entre estaciones difusoras que ocupen canales adyacentes tanto para el servicio diurno como para el servicio nocturno . La Tabla IV muestra la separación que se requiere entre estaciones difusoras que ocupen el mismo canal para servicio nocturno . En el Apéndice VI se consignan las condiciones de operación supuestas.-
Las tablas están basadas en el uso de antenas no direccionales ; pero, si se empleare una antena direccional en una estación determinada, habrá que considerar la distribución de la radiación de dicha antena, modificando correspondientemente la separación en millas . Para calcular las Tablas de separación en el servicio nocturno de estaciones en la misma frecuencia, se ha empleado la curva de onda reflejada que se muestra en el Apéndice V. Dichas curvas tienen como base abundantes y cuidadosas medidas de ondas reflejadas producidas por estaciones difusoras y se las considerará exactas en todos los casos , a menos de que se presenten testimonios en contrario, según se estipula en la Sección E-4 . Las Tablas de separación en millas para estaciones en un mismo canal, para servicio diurno , y para canales adyacentes en el servicio diurno y nocturno, se han calculado valiéndose de la curva de onda terrestre que aparece en el Apéndice IV. Las Tablas se aplican únicamente en el caso de que la frecuencia sea de 1000 kilociclos y de que la constante dieléctrica y la conductibilidad terrestre sean las supuestas.- En vista de que estos valores varían en cada caso , las Tablas de separación para servicio diurno y canales adyacentes no podrán usarse sino como guía general . -Al considerar cada caso en particular, podrá calcularse la separación en millas requerida, tomando en cuenta la frecuencia de trabajo y las condiciones de la tierra conocidas o supuestas .-Para determinar la interferencia con exactitud , deberán efectuarse medidas de acuerdo con lo expuesto en la Sección E-4, en la frecuencia que se esté considerando o en cualquier otra frecuencia ; pudiendo determinarse, por medio de las curvas, los valores para la frecuencia deseada.-
F.-GENERALIDADES .
1.-Normas de Ingeniería.-Las normas de ingeniería establecidas en este Convenio quedan sujetas a revisión para cuando los adelantos técnicos lo justifiquen, según lo determinen de común acuerdo los Gobiernos participantes en el mismo.-

Se reconoce que los Estados Unidos de América tienen que hacer numerosos reajustes en la asignación de sus estaciones establecidas para poder llevar a efecto este Convenio ; que para hacer estos reajustes se necesitará por lo menos un año y que por el momento no le es posible a los Estados Unidos de América especificar en cuales de los 32 canales ha de tener prioridad en el uso para estaciones Clase I-A, Clase I-B y Clase II , respectivamente, ni señalar la ubicación de dichas estaciones, su potencia y otros informes sobre ellas . Los Estados Unidos de América, podrán asignar estaciones Clase I -A a por lo menos 25 de dichos canales . Los Estados Unidos de América convienen en que noventa días antes de entrar en vigor este Convenio suministrarán estos informes a los otros países partes en este Convenio , y que esta informacion, cuando haya sido comunicada , será considerada como parte de este Convenio tal como si apareciera in extenso en el mismo.
Nada de lo expuesto en este Convenio se interpretará en el sentido de que impide a los Estados Unidos de América hacer valer y que se le reconozca la prioridad en el uso en lo que se refiere a ciertas otras estaciones de la Clase II (que no se incluyen entre las 63 estaciones que se mencionan en la Tabla I ) que en la actualidad operan en la banda de 640 a 1190 kilociclos y que en los Reglamentos de la Comisión Federal de Comunicaciones (Federal Communications Commission) se denominan "estaciones de tiempo limitado " ("limited time stations" ) y "estaciones diurnas" (" daytime stations ")- estableciéndose la puesta del sol como límite de sus horas de funcionamiento-ya sea que la puesta del sol se tome en las ubicaciones respectivas de las estaciones o en las de las estaciones dominantes respectivas de canal despejado , lo que en algunos casos incluye horas en que en efecto no usan dichas estaciones dominantes ,-estaciones a las que se les puede hacer asignaciones que en lo substancial sean equivalentes a las que ahora tienen, siempre que lo permitan las disposiciones de este Convenio y las normas de ingeniería que en él se establecen .

De otras estaciones en el mismo canal solamente. Véase el Apéndice III, Tabla I, respecto a los canales adyacentes .
· Se excede la intensidad de campo de la onda reflejada 10% del tiempo. No se asignará estación alguna de la Clase II al mismo canal que una estación de la Clase I-A para que
opere de noche (desde la puesta hasta la salida del sol) a menos de 650 millas de la frontera más cercana del país en que esté situada la estación de la Clase I-A.
· Estos valores se refieren a interferencia causada por todas las estaciones excepto las de la Clase I las cuales pueden causar interferencia en un contorno de intensidad de campo de valor más elevado.- Sin embargo, se recomienda que las estaciones de la Clase II se sitúen de tal modo que la interferencia que les causen las estaciones de la Clase I no exceda estos valores. Si las estaciones de la Clase II quedan limitadas por las de la Clase I a valores más elevados, entonces esos valores constituirán la norma establecida respecto a la interferencia de parte de todas las otras clases de estaciones

ACCORD REGIONAL DE RADIO- DIFFUSION DE L'AMERIQUE DU NORD
Signé par les gouvernements suivants:
Canada, Cuba, Etats Unis d'Amérique, Haiti , Méxique et République Dominicaine .
Les soussignés plénipotentiaires des gouvernements ci-dessus énumerés, s'étant réunis en conférence à la Havane, ont d'un commun accord et sous réserve de ratification , arrêté la Convention suivante:
OBJET ET PORTEE DE CETTE CONVENTION.
1. Objet de la Convention . L'objet de la présente Convention est le réglement et l'établissement des principes qui protègent l'emploi de la bande normale de diffusion dans la Région de l'Amérique du Nord de telle façon que chaque pays puisse obtenir l'emploi le plus efficace de cette bande avec le minimum d'interférence téchnique entre les postes diffuseurs .
2. Région de l'Amérique du Nord. On considerera que la Region de l'Amérique du Nord (qui sera désignée par "Region " dans les pages suivantes) comprendra et sera formée par les pays suivants : Canada, Cuba , République Dominicaine, Haïti , Méxique, Terre-Neuve et Etats Unis d'Amé[ri]que .
2. Bande Normale de Diffusion . On appellera Bande Normale de Diffusion la bande de fréquence qui comprend 550 Kc . à 1600 Kc. , les deux comprises ; la fréquence de 550 ainsi que celle de 1600 Kc/s . seront des fréquences porteuses de voies de diffusion d'accord avec ce qui est défini ci-dessous . Les Gouvernements assujetis aux dispositions de l'article 7 du Réglement Général de Radio-communications annexé à la Convention Internationale de Télecommunications (Madrid 1932 ) accordent que cette bande de fréquences sera exclusivement assignée à la radio-diffusion dans cette Région .
4. Droit Souverain a l'Emploi des Voies. On reconnait à tous les pays parties de cette Convention, le droit souverain à l'emploi de toutes les voies dans la bande normale de diffusion . Cependant les Gouvernements reconnaissent que jusqu'a ce que les progrés téchniques n'atteigne un état permettant l'élimination de l'interférence de radio-diffusion, de caractère international, un arrangement régional , signé par eux, est nécessaire pour établir la normalisation et réduire l'interférence au minimum.
5. Caractère Régional de la Convention . Les Gouvernements reconnaissent que la présente Convention , ainsi que chacune de ses parties est un arrangement régional dans l'esprit de la Convention Internationale de Télécommunications et du Réglement Général de Radiocommunications qui y est annexé, et autorisée par ces derniers.

A. DEFINITIONS .

TECHNIQUE .

1. Station de radio-diffusion : Une station dont les émissions sont principalement destinées à ètre reçues par le public en général .
2.-Voies de radio-diffusion- 550 à 1600 Kc.: Une voie de radiodiffusion est une bande de fréquence de 10Kc . de largeur dont la fréquence porteuse ccupe le centre . Les voies seront désignées par les fréquences porteuses attribuées . Les fréquences porteuses attribuées aux stations de radio -diffusion commenceront à 550 Kc . et augmenteront progressivement de 10 en 10 Kc. Aucune fréquence intermédiaire ne devra être attribuée comme fréquence porteuse d'une station de radio-diffusion .
3. Aires de service: (a) Aire de service primaire . On appelle aire de service primaire
d'une station de radio -diffusion l'aire dans laquelle l'onde de surface n'est sujette à aucune interférence nuisible ou aucun évanouissement nuisible .
(b) Aire de service secondaire. On appelle aire de service secondaire d'une station de radio-diffusion d'aire desservie par l'onde réflechie sans interférence nuisible . L'intensité de champ y est sujette a des fluctuations intermitentes .
4. Station dominantes. Une station dominante est une station de la classe I , définie ci-apres , travaillant sur une voie libre.
5.-Station secondaire . Une station secondaire est une station quelconque, autre qu'une station de la classe I, travaillant sur une voie libre.
6.-Interférence nuisible. Il y a interférence nuisible lorsque, à une limite déterminée ou aux limites d'une valeur déterminée d'intensité de champ de la station désirée , l'intensité de champ d'une station non désirée (ou la valeur effective du carré moyen des intensités de champ de deux ou de plusieurs stations travaillant sur la même fréquence) dé!passe dix ( 10) pour cent du temps , ou plus, les valeurs spécifiées dans le présent Accord .
7.-Puissance. La puissance d'un radioémetteur est la puissance fournie à l'antenne . La puissance d'antenne d'un émetteur modulé s'exprimera par deux chiffres , l'un indiquant la puissance-antenne de l'onde porteuse et l'autre le maximum réel du pourcentage de modulation .
8.--Rayonnement parasite . On appelle rayonnement parasite d'un émetteur toute émission qui se trouve en dehors de la bande de fréquence normale du type d'émission employé , y compris les harmoniques de modulation , les claquements de manipulation , les oscillations parasites et autres effets transitoires .
9.-Equivalents anglais français et espagnols. Il est convenu que, pour les fins de cet accord , les mots français et espagnols indigués ci-dessoussont respectivement équivalents et ont

55 STAT. ] NORTH AMERICAN- REGIONAL BROADCASTING- DEC. 13, 1937

la même signification que les termes anglais en face desquels ils sont inscrits .

Anglais Clear channel. Objectionable inter-
ference

Français Voie libre Interference nuisible

Espagnol Canal despejado. Interferencia objetable.

B. CLASSES DE VOIES ET ATTRIBUTIONS DE CELLES- CI .

1.- Trois classes . Les 106 voies de la bande normale de radiodiffusion sont divisées en trois classes principales : libre, régionale et locale.
2.-Vois libre. On appelle voie libre une voie sur laquelle la ou les stations dominantes desservent des territoires, étendus , et sont exemptes d'interférence nuisible dans les limites de leur aire de service primaire, et sur la totalité ou une partie importante de leur aire de service secondaire.
3.- Voie régionale . On appelle voie régionale une voie sur laquelle plusieurs stations peuvent travailler avec des puissances n'excédant pas 5 Kw. L'aire de service primaire d'une station travaillant sur l'une de ces voies est limitée , comme conséquence de l'interférence, à une limite déterminée de la valeur d'intensité de champ .
4.-Voie locale. On appelle voie locale une voie sur laquelle plusieurs stations peuvent travailler avec des puissances n'excédant pas 250 watts . L'aire de service primaire d'une station travaillant sur l'une de ces voies est limitée, comme conséquence de l'interférence, à une limite déterminée de la valeur d'intensité de champ .
5.-Nombre de voies de chaque classe . Le nombre de voies de chaque classe est comme suit :

Voies libres

8,-Priorité d'emploi des voies libres par les pays. (a) Les voies libres sont attribuées avec priorité d'emploi par les
stations des classes I et II , dans les divers pays , en conformité avec les tableau de l'Appendice I.
(b) Chacone de ces voies devra être utilisée d'une manière conforme à la meilleure technique, ayant en vue le service que les stations dominantes , travaillant sur ces mêmes voies doivent rendre, en conformité avec les stipulations du présent Accord . Si toutefois , pendant une année quelconque de la durée du présent Accord , un pays ne fait aucun emploi d'une voie libre qui lui a été attribuée , celle-ci sera considérée comme disponible pour les autres pays , participants au présent Accord, à la suite d'un arrangement entre leurs administrations respectives , et sans qu'il soit nécessaire de réviser le présent Accord.
(c) Aucun pays à qui une voie libre a été ainsi attribuée ne permettra ou ne conviendra de permettre à un autre pays d'utiliser cette voie d'une manière qui ne soit pas conforme au présent Accord sans avoir donné au préalable 60 jours (") d'avis de son intention, a tous les autres pays participants au présent Accord . Si durant cet intervalle de 60 jours , un autre pays présente des objections à l'usage proposé de cette voie, le pays à qui la voie libre était attribuée ne permettra pas et ne conviendra pas de permettre tel usage proposé, jusqu'à ce que le different représenté par l'objection, ait été amicalement résolu.
(d ) Si pendant la durée du présent Accord un pays à qui une voie libre a été attribuée a utilisé cette voie mais non de la manière pres-
crite , ou sans en faire usage complet aux termes du présent Accord , ce pays sera considéré avoir abandonné la partie de ses droits qu'il n'a pas utilisé. , et à l'expiration du présent Accord , les autres pays participants auront le droit , s'ils le jugent bon, de retirer à tel pays les privilèges non utilisés et de les attribuer à l'un des pays interessés ou à tous les autres .

C. CLASSES DE STATIONS ET UTILISATION DES DIVERSES CLASES DE VOIS.
1.- Classes de stations . Les stations de radio -diffusion sont divisées en 4 classes principales qui seront désignées Classe I , Classe II, Classe III , et Classe IV respectivement.
2.-Définition des classes . Les quatre classes de stations de radiodiffusion sont définies comme suit:

(*) jours communs ou naturels.

55 STAT.] NORTH AMERICAN-REGIONAL BROADCASTING- DEC. 13, 1937
Classe 1.-Une station dominante travaillant sur une vois libre et destinée à rendre un service primaire et secondaire à des territoires étendus et à des distances relativement grandes . Les stations de la classe I, forment deux subdivisions .
Clase I-A: Une station de la classe I , travaillant avec une puissance de 50 kw. ou plus et dont l'aire de service primaire , dans les limites du pays où la station est située , est exempte d'interférence nuisible provenant d'autres stations travaillant sur la même voie ou sur voies adjacentes et son aire de service secondaire, en dedans des mêmes limites exempte d'interférence nuisible, provenant de stations travaillant sur la même voie en conformité avec les régles techniques stipulées ci-après.
Classe I-B: Une station de la classe I travaillant avec une puissance de pas moins de 10 kw. et pas plus de 50 kw. et dont l'aire de service primaire est exempte d'interfèrences nuisibles provenant d'autres stations travaillant sur la même voie et sur les voies adjacentes , et son aire de service secondaire exempte d'interfèrences nuisibles provenant de stations travaillant sur la meme voie, en conformité avec les règles techniques stipulées ci-après .
(a) Lorsque deux stations de la Classe I -b travaillant sur la même voie sont séparées par une distance de 2800 milles ou plus , ni l'une ni l'autre ne seront obligées à installer une antenne dirigée .
(b) Lorsque deux stations de la classe I-b , travaillant sur la même voie , sont séparées par una distance de plus de 1800 milles et de moins de 2800 milles , on considérera , à moins de preuve du contraire, que chacune d'elles est exempte d'interference nuisible causée par l'autre et ni l'autre ne sera obligée à installer une antenne dirigée, ou à prendre d'autres mesures pour éviter l'interférence. Dans le cas où l'interférence nuisible est prouvée, les Gouvernements interessés consulteront sur la convenance et la possibilité d'installer des antennes dirigées ou de prendre d'autres mesures pour faire disparaître l'interférence , et détermineront le cas échéant, par arrangement spécial , les mesures à prendre.
(c) Lorsque deux stations de la Classe I-b travaillant sur la même voie sont séparées par une distance de moins de 1800 milles , on considérera , à moins de preuvre du contraire, qu'il est nécessaire , pour éviter l'interférence d'installer des antennes dirigées ou de prendre d'autres mesures, et les gouvernements interessés se concerteront pour prendre les mesures convenues afin de faire disparaitre ou de diminuer l'interférence nuisible.
Classe II. Une station "secondaire" travaillant sur une voie libre, et destinée à desservir une aire de service primaire qui , selon la situation géographique et la puissance utilisée, peut être relativement étendue, mais qui est sujette à l'interférence provenant des stations de la classe I et qui est limitée par celle-ci . Une telle station travaillera avec une puissance de pas moins de 0.25 Kw . et de pas plus de 50 Kw. Chaque fois qu'il sera nécessaire une station de la classe II utilisera

1069

1070

TREATIES

[55 STAT.

une antenne dirigée ou d'autres moyens pour éviter l'interférence aux stations de la Classe I et aux autres stations de la classe II , en conformité avec les regles techniques stipulées si-après .
Classe III -Une station travaillant sur une voie régionale et principalement destinée à desservir un district métropolitain et le territoire rural environnant. Les stations de la classe III forment deux subdivisions:
Classe III-A: Une station de la classe III travaillant avec
une puissance de pas moins de un kilowatt et de pas plus de cinq kilowatts , et dont l'aire de service est sujette à l'interférence, en conformité, avec les règles techniques stipulées ci-après.
Classe III-B: Une station de la classe III travaillant avec une puissance de pas moins de 0.5 Kw. et de pas plus de 1 Kw. la nuit et 5 Kw. le jour, et dont l'aire de service est sujette à l'interférence, en conformité avec les régles techniques stipulées ci-après .
Classe IV. Une station utilisant une voie locale et destinée
principalement à desservir un bourg ou une ville et la région avoisinante . La puissance d'une station de cette classe ne devra pas être inférieure a 0.1 Kw. ou supérieure à 0.25 Kw. et son aire de service est sujette à l'interférence , en conformité avec les règles techniques stipulées ci-après .
3. -Changement de classe . Si une ou plusieurs stations de la Classe III-B, situées dans un pays quelconque peuvent, en utilisant une antenne dirigée ou d'autre manière diminuer l'interférence causée ou reçue par ces stations jusqu'à la valeur d'intensité de champ admise pour les stations de la classe III-A, de telles stations seront automatiquement inclues dans la classe III-A, et seront reconnues et considérées comme telles par les Administrations de tous les pays de la Région.
4.-Emploi des vois libres. (a) En principe et sujettes seulement à l'exception stipulée ci-
après, les stations de la classe I ne pourr-ont utiliser que des voies libres.
(b) les stations de la Classe II ne pourront utiliser que des voies libres , mais à condition de ne causer aucune interférence nuisible aux stations de la Classe I ; lorsqu'un pays a la priorité de l'emploi d'une voie libre, pour une station de la classe I-A, aucun autre pays ne devra attribuer cette voie a une station de la classe II travaillant la nuit (depuis le coucher jusqu'au lever du soleil au point où la station de la classe II est située) à moins que cette station de la classe II soit située à une distance de pas moins de 650 milles de la frontière la plus rapprochée du pays où la station de la classe I-A est située ; il est entendu cependant que pour les cas ou une station de la classe II ou l'attribution d'une station de la classe II a été spécifiée à l'appendice I , cette attribution sera tenue pour autorisée avec les restrictions qui y sont stipulées .
5.-Emploi des voies régionales. (a) En général , les voies régionales ne pourront être attribuées
qu'à des stations des classes III-A et III-B .

55 STAT. ] NORTH AMERICAN- REGIONAL BROADCASTING--DEC. 13, 1937
(b) A condition de ne pas causer d'interférences aux stations des classes III-A ou III-B, et sujet aux interférences qu'elles pourront recevoir des stations de la classe III-A ou de la classe III-B, les stations de la classe IV pourront utiliser des voies régionales .
(c) A cause de leur situation géographique par rapport au continent américain , on considérera spécialement l'utilisation par Cuba, Saint-Domingue, Haiti , et Terre-Neuve de certaines voies régionales pour des stations des classes I et II , sous certaines conditions concernant la puissance et les précautions à prendre pour éviter l'interférence nuisible telle que stipulée à l'Appendice VII .
6.-Emploi des voies locales. Seules les stations de la classe IV pourront utiliser des voies locales .
D. SERVICE ET INTERFERENCE .
1.-Signal satisfaisant . Il est reconnu qu'en l'absence d'interférences provennant d'autres stations et dans les régions ou le niveau. des atmosphériques et des bruits parasites n'est pas excessif, un signal de 100 microvolts par mètre est un signal utilisable dans les régions rurales et de faible population , mais qu'à cause du niveau plus élévé des parasites, des intensités de champ plus élevées (s'élevant jusqu'à 25 millivolts ou plus dans les villes ) sont nécessaires pour desservir les régions dont la population est plus dense. Il est reconnu de plus qu'il n'est pas possible de protèger les stations contre l'interférence nuisible, particulièrement la nuit sur toute l'étendue des territoires où leurs signaux ont un niveau supérieur à celui des parasites , et qu'il est nécessaire de stipuler des limites ou périmètres auxquels ou à l'intérieur desquels les stations sont protégées contre l'interférence nuisible provenant d'autres stations .
2.-Aire protégéé contre l'interférence nuisible . Les limites ou
périmétres auxquels où a l'intérieur desquels les diverses classes de stations seront protégées contre l'interférence nuisible, sont stipulés à l'appendice II. Il n'y aura cependant aucune obligation à protéger une station contre l'interférence nuisible en des points qui se trouvent en dehors des frontières du pays où elle est située.
En ce qui concerne les valeurs effectives des intensités de champ des interférences dont il est question dans ce document, il est entendu qu'elles s'appliquent pour déterminer l'interférence entre des stations existantes, et qu'aucune station à laquelle une voie serait attribuée par la suite ne devra augmenter la valeur effective de l'intensité du champ d'interférence au dessus des maxima stipulée dans les tableaux annexés .
3.- Interférence nuisible sur la même voie. On considérera qu'il y a interférence nuisible au service d'une
station lorsque à une limite déterminée ou aux limités d'une valeur déterminée d'intensité de champ , tel que stipulé à l'appendice II , au sujet de la classe à laquelle la station appartient , l'intensité de champ de la station qui produit l'interférence (ou la valeur effective des intensités de champ de deux ou de plusieurs stations qui produisent l'interférence) , et qui travaille sur la même voie dix (10 ) pour cent du

1071

1072

TREATIES

[55 STAT.

temps ou plus , la valeur admissible , tel que stipulé pour cette classes

à l'Appendice II . 4.-Interférences causées aux stations dominantes sur voie libre . Une
station est considérée incapable de causer de l'interférence nuisible à une station de la classe I travaillant sur la même fréquence quand elle est séparée de la station dominante par une différence de longitude de 70° ou plus.

5.-Interférence nuisible sur les voies adjacentes . On reconnait en principe qu'on peut causer de l'interférence nuisible à une station

désirée lorsque aux limites ou à l'ntérieur des limites d'une valeur

déterminée de l'intensité de champ de la station désirée , l'intensité

de champ de l'onde de surface d'une station non désirée travaillant sur

une voie adjacente (ou la valeur effective des intensités de champ de deux ou de plusieurs stations non désirées travaillant sur la même voie

adjacente) dépasse la valeur déterminée par les rapports suivants :

Séparation entre les voies. 10 kc 20 kc

Rapport minimum admissible du signal désiré au signal non désiré.
1 à 0.5
1 à 10

30 kc.

1 à 50

On peut s'en rapporter au Tableau I de l'Appendice III , pour les valeurs maximum admissibles du signal d'interférence sur voies

adjacentes et pour les périmètres stipulés. 6. Application des règles aus stations existantes. (a) Pour évaluer l'interférence nuisible, toutes les stations (autres
que celles de la Classe II ) seront considérées comme utilisant les puissances maxima permises pour leurs classes respectives . A cette fin, la puissance des stations de la classe 1 -A sera considérée être 50 Kw. ou la puissance réelle si elle dépasse cette valeur.
(b) A partir de l'aplication du prèsent Accord une station à laquelle on attribuera une voie déja attribuée à d'autres stations ne sera pas considerée comme devant empêcher les stations existantes d'augmenter leur puissance jusqu'au maximum permis à leur classe, même si cette augmentation de puissance devait limiter l'aire de service

de la nouvelle station à une valeur d'intensité de champ plus elevée que la valeur admis-e pour la classe de la nouvelle station.

7.-Stabilite de Fréquence. La fréquence de travail de chaque station

de radio-diffusion sera mantenue dans une limite de 50 cycles à partir

de la fréquence attribuée, jusqu'au 1er. Janvier 1939 , et après cette

date la fréquence de chaque nouvelle station ou de chaque station dans

laquelle un nouveau transmetteur est installé sera mantenue dans une

limite de 20 cycles à partir de la fréquence attribuée, et après le 1er.

juin de 1942 la fréquence de toutes les stations sera mantenue dans

une limite de 20 cycles . 8.-Rayonnement parasite .

Les Gouvernements tâcheront de

diminuer et, s'il est possible d'éliminer les émissions parasites des

55 STAT. ] NORTH AMERICAN-REGIONAL BROADCASTING-DEC. 13, 1937

stations de radio-diffusion ,- Ces rayonnements seront diminués dans tous les cas de façon a n'avoir pas une intensité suffisante pour causer de l'interférence en dehors de la bande de fréquences necessaire pour le type d'émission employé.- En ce qui concerne le type d'émission A-3 (radio-téléphonique) le transmetteur ne devra pas être modulé au-dela de sa capacité de modulation jusqu'au point de produire des émissions parasites capables de causer de l'interférence, et en ce qui concerne la modulation d'amplitude , le pourcentage de modulation dans les crêtes fréquences ne devra pas être inferieur à 75 %. On devra prendre les précautions nécessaires pour que le transmetteur ne soit pas modulé au-dela de sa capacité de modulation .

E.--DÉTERMINATION DE LA PRÉSENCE DE L'INTERFÉRENCE NUISIBLE .

1.- Rendement de l'antenne. - Afin de prévoir la présence de l'inter-

férence nuisible et de pouvoir en évaluer le degré, les stations de diverses classes seront considerées comme produisant des valeurs effectives d'intensité de champ, corrigées pour l'absorption, et par

kilowat de puissance fournie à l'antenne , comme suit:

Classe de station

A un mille

A un kilometre.

I II et III IV

225 mv/m 175 mv/m 150 mv/m

362 mv/m 282 mv/m 241 mv/m

Si on emploie une antenne dirigée , le signal d'une station de radio-diffusion susceptible de causer de l'interférence variera dans des directions differentes.- Pour déterminer l'interférence dans une direction donnée et en l'absence de mesures, de l'interférence, les schemas d'intensité de champ horizontal et d'intensité de champ de l'antenne dirigée devront être calculés et par comparaison de vecteurs appropiés du schéma horizontal ou vertical avec ceux d'une antenne non dirigée ayant la même valeur effective de champ, on pourra évaluer en kilowatts l'intensité du signal dans la direction d'une autre station. On se servira de la puissance ainsi déterminée pour faire l'usage des tableaux de séparation en milles ou pour calculer les distances d'après les courbes ou les tableaux de propagation.
2.--Puissance . La puissance d'une station sera déterminée , pour les fins de notifications requises par le prèsent accord , par l'une des méthodes suivantes :
(a) En faisant le produit du carré du courant d'antenne par la résistance de l'antenne (puissance fournie à l'antenne) .
(b) En déterminant la valeur effective d'intensité de champ de la station, corrigée pour l'absorbtion , par un nombre suffisant de mesures d'intensité de champ effectuées sur au moins huit rayons, autant que possible également espacés , et en rapportant l'intensité de champ ainsi déterminée à la valeur effective d'intensité du champ d'une station dont l'antenne possède le rendement stipulé plus haut pour sa classe.-

TREATIES

[55 STAT.

3.-Méthodes pour déterminer la présence de l'interférence nuisible. Géneralités.
La présence ou l'absence d'interférences nuisibles provenant des stations travaillant sur la même voie ou sur des voies adjacentes sera déterminée par l'une des méthodes suivantes:
(a) Par des mesures effectuées de la manière stipulée ci-aprés . Ou, du consentement mutuel des pays interessés ;
(b) En s'en rapportant aux courbes de propagation qui apparaissent aux Appendices IV et V, ou
(c) En s'en rapportant au tableau de distances qui apparait à l'Apendice VI.
4.-Preuve de la présence ou de l'absence d'interférence nuisible.La présence ou l'absence d'interférence nuisible peut être prouvée
par des mesures ou par des enregistreurs d'intensité de champ , effectuées avec des appareils appropriés, dûment étalonnés , par des ingénieurs du Gouvernement ou d'autres ingénieurs mutuellement acceptés par les Gouvernements interessés . Ces mesures d'intensité de champ seront effectuées de la manière et pour les périodes de temps mutuellement convenus par les Gouvernements interessés .
Les Gouvernements contractants out convenu de faciliter la prise de mesure en réquérant que les stations interessées restent silencieuses ou travaillant de la manière jugée nécessaire, et à des heures qui n'interrompront pas leur horaire régulier.
5.-Preuves basées sur les courbes de propagation et les tableaux de distances.
(a) Courbes de l'onde d'espace . Pour calculer la distance jusqu'aux limites d'une valeur d'intensité de champ donnée de l'onde d'espace (50 % du temps) , d'une station de la classe I de puissance donnée, et aussi pour calculer l'intensité de champ de l'onde d'espace (10 % du temps) à une distance donnée d'une station de classe et de puissance quelconque considérée comme cause d'interférence, on pourra se servir des courbes appropiées qui apparaissent à l'Appendice V, intitulé "Intensité moyenne de champ de l'onde d'espace correspondant à la deuxième heure après le coucher du soleil au poste enregistreur , 100 millivolts par mètre à un mille ( 161 à 1 Km. ) "
(b) Courbes de l'onde de surface. La distance jusqu'aux limites d'une valeur d'intensité de champ donnée de l'onde de surface peut être déterminée au moyen de courbes appropiées de l'onde de surface, établies pour la fréquence prévue, la conductivité et la constance diéléctrique du terrain entre la station et le périmetre désiré. La fréquence et la conductivité du terrain doivent être prises en considération dans tous les cas et pour les grandes distances on devra tenir compte des pertes dues à la courbure de la terre. Une série de courbes est nécessaire dans ce but.- Un graphique pour la conductivitée de 10-13 apparait à l'Appendice IV, intitulé "Intensité de champ de l'onde de surface par rapport à la distance pour 1 Kilowatt rayonné par une antenne courte ".- Trois fréquences de la bande normale de radio-diffusion sont indiquées. Pour d'autres fréquences et d'autres

55 STAT. ] NORTH AMERICAN- REGIONAL BROADCASTING - DEC. 13, 1937
caractéristiques du sol (conductivité et constance diéléctrique) d'autres courbes sont nécessaires . La conductivité de 10-13 est considérée comme une moyenne et a servi à déterminer toutes les valeurs d'onde
de surface pour le calcul des tableaux de distances de séparation . (c) Tableaux de distances. Le Tableau I indique les distances requises en milles , entre les
stations de radio-diffusion travaillant le jour sur la même voie . Le Tableau II indique les distances requises en milles , à partir de la frontiére d'un pays dans lequel est située une station de la classe 1 -A, dans le cas d'une station de la classe II , travaillant le jour sur la même voie dans un autre pays . Le Tableau III indique les distances requises , en milles, entre des stations de radio-diffusion travaillant le jour et la nuit sur des voies adjacentes . Le Tableau IV indique les distances requises, en milles , entre des stations de radio -diffusion travaillant la nuit sur la même voie . L'Appendice VI indique les conditions de travail supposées pour le calcul de ces Tableaux.
Les Tableaux sont établis en supposant que l'on utilise une antenne non dirigée , pour les cas particuliers où on emploi une antenne dirigée, il sera nécessaire de prendre en considération le schéma de distribution du rayonnement de l'antenne dirigée en question , et de modifier les distances en consèquence. les Tableaux qui indiquent les distances pour les stations travaillant la nuit sur la même voie on été calculées d'apres le courbe d'onde d'éspace de l'Appendice V. Ces courbes sont établies d'après des mesures nombreuses de l'onde d'éspace produite par les stations de radio-diffusion, et seront considerées comme exactes dans tous les cas à moins de preuve du contraire, telle que stipulée à la Section E-4.- Les Tableaux de distances pour les stations travaillant sur la même voie pendant le jour, et pour les stations travaillant sur des voies adjacentes pendant le jour et pendant la nuit sont calculés d'après la courbe d'onde de surface de l'Appendice IV. Ces Tableaux ne sont applicables que pour la fréquence de mille Kc. et pour la conductivité et la constance diéléctrique supposée . Etant donné que ces valeurs sont différentes dans chaque cas les Tableaux de distances pour le jour et pour les voies adjacentes, ne devront être utilisés que comme un guide.- Dans chaque cas particulier on pourra évaluer les distances requises en tenant compte de la fréquence de travail et des caractéristiques du sol connues ou supposées.- Pour déterminer l'interférence avec exactitude il faut effectuer des mesures comme il est stipulé dans la Section E-4 , soit sur la fréquence en question, soit sur une autre fréquence , en déterminant les valeurs cherchées d'après les courbes.-
F. DIVERS :
1.- Regles Téchniques . Les régles téchniques stipulées dans le présent Accord sont sujettes à revision lorsque les progrès de la téchnique le justifieront , et du consentement mutuel des Gouvernements participants au présent Accord .

· Ces stations emploieront des antennes dirigées pour éviter de causer des interférences nuisibles aux stations de la classe III qui sont sur la mème voie, selon l'Appendice VII.
TABLEAU VI
CONDITIONS SPECIALES CONCERNANT LES ETATS UNIS D'Amérique,
Les 24 stations des classe I et II des Etats Unis qui utilisent des voies libres avec d'autres pays participant aux présent Accord , sont indiquées par les Tableaux III et Iv.
Les voies libres suivantes seront attribuées aux 39 autres stations des classes I et II des Etats Unis :
640 650 660 670 680 700 710 720 750 760 770 780 820 830 840 850 870 880 890 1020 1030 1040 1100 1120 1160 1180 1200 1210 1500 1510 1520 1530

55 STAT. ] NORTH AMERICAN- REGIONAL BROADCASTING- DEC. 13, 1937
On reconnait que les Etats Unis devront effectuer des modifications importantes dans les attributions de ses stations existantes pour rendre possible la mise en pratique du présent Accord, que ces modifications exigeront un délai d'environ une année , et qu'il n'est pas possible aux Etats Unis de spécifier en ce moment sur les-quelles de ces 32 voies sera fixée leur prioritée pour des stations de la classe I-A, des stations de la classe I-B et des stations de la classe II respectivement, ni de spécifier la situation, la puissance et autres renseignements concernant ces stations . Les Etats Unis pourront attribuer aux moins 25 de ces voies à des stations de la classe I-A. Les Etats
Unis s'engagent à communiquer ces renseignements à chaqu'un des autres pays participants au présent Accord quatre vingts dix jours avant la date d'entrée en vigueur de celui -ci et ces renseignements , lorsqu'ils auront été communiqués seront considerés comme faisant partie du présent Accord tout comme s'ils y étaient inclus.-
Rien de ce qui a été exposé dans la présente Convention ne pourra s'interpréter dans le sens d'un empêchement pour les Etats Unis de faire valoir et de faire reconnaitre la priorité de l'usage se rapportant à d'autres stations de la Classe II (qui ne sont pas comprises entre les 63 stations de la Table I) qui actuellement exploitent la bande de 640 a 1190 kilocycles , et qui dans les Réglements de la Commission Fédérale de Communications (Federal Communications Commission) se désignent par "stations de temps limité" ("limited time stations" ) et "stations de jour " (" daytime stations" ) --en fixant le coucher du soleil comme limite de leurs heures d'exploitation - soit le coucher du soleil des situations respectives des stations, soit celui des stations. dominantes respectives de la voie libre , ce qui est cause quelquefois que ces stations dominantes ne peuvent employer certaines heures ,stations auxquelles on peut fixer des attributions qui soient en essence équivalentes à celles qu'elles ont à present, si les dispositions de cette Convention et les principes de génie qui y sont établis, le permettent .
TABLEAU VII
CONDITIONS SPECIALES CONCERNANT L'USAGE DE 1010 Kc/S PAR CUBA ET LE CANADA
En ce qui concerne l'utilisation de la voie libre de 1010 Kc/s par une station de la classe I-A au Canada , et par une station de la classe I-B à Cuba, ces deux pays ont mutuellement convenu que le signal d'interférence ne dépassera pas , pendant 10 % ou plus du temps , la valeur de 50 microvolts par mètre aux points de mesure suivants : à Cuba, un point quelconque à l'est de la province de Camagüey , et au Canada un point quelconque à l'ouest de la province de Manitoba.
TABLEAU VIII CONDITIONS SPECIALES CONCERNANT LE CANADA
Rien de ce qui est dit dans le présent Accord ne sera interpreté comme pouvant empêcher le Canada d'affirmer ses droits de priorité au sujet de certaines stations des classes III et IV, actuellement en exploitation au Canada sur des voies libres et régionales actuelles qui comme résultat du présent Accord , passeront dans une classe de voies que des stations des classes III et IV, ne devront pas utiliser.

·En conformité avec d'autres dispositions du présent Accord cette absence d'interférence ne s'applique pas en dehors des frontières du pays ou la station est située.
Seulement dans la mesure qu'elle provient de stations travaillant sur la même voie. Pour les voies adja. centes voir l'Appendice III Tableau I.
Intensité d'onde d'espace dépassée pendant 10% du temps. ¿On ne devra pas attribuer à une station de la classe II travaillant la nuit (depuis le coucher jusqu'au lever du soleil) , la même voie qu'à une station de la classe I-A, à une distance de moins de 650 milles à partir de la frontière la plus rapprochée du pays où la station de la classe I-A est située. Ces valeurs sont par rapport à l'interférence provenant de toutes les stations exceptées celles de la classe I qui pourront causer de l'interférence jusqu'aux limites d'une valeur plus élevée d'intensité de champ. Toutefois, on recommande de placer les stations de la classe II de telle sorte que l'interférence qu'elles reçoivent des stations de la classe I ne dépasse pas ces valeurs. Si les stations de la classe II sont limitées par les stations de la classe I à des valeurs plus élevées, ces dernières deviendront la règle par rapport à l'interférence provenant de toutes les autres classes de stations.

EXCHANGE OF NOTES

The Secretary of State to the Danish Minister

DEPARTMENT OF STATE WASHINGTON

SIR:

April 7, 1941

I have the honor to refer to the informal conversations which you have had with officers of the Department of State during which the concern of the Government of the United States was expressed over the effect of recent military developments, particularly affecting Greenland, upon the maintenance of the peace and security of the United States and the rest of the American Continent.
You are also aware of the interest of the Government of the United

States in maintaining unimpaired the safety of Greenland and the sovereignty of Denmark over that island . My Government has continuously had in mind the desire expressed by the United Greenland Councils at their meeting at Godhavn on May 3, 1940 that the Government of the United States of America would continue to hold

in mind the exposed position of the Danish flag in Greenland and of the native Greenland and Danish population of the island.
My Government has taken note of the unusual situation in which Greenland now finds itself. The Kingdom of Denmark is at present under occupation by a foreign army. The Government of the United States has condemned that invasion as a violation of Danish sovereign

1251

1252 54 Stat. 2491.

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [ 55 STAT.
rights , and has repeatedly expressed its friendly concern and its most earnest hope for the complete and speedy liberation of Denmark. Although the Government of the United States fully recognizes the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Denmark over Greenland , it is unhappily clear that the Government in Denmark is not in a position to exercise sovereign power over Greenland so long as the present military occupation continues.
Greenland is within the area embraced by the Monroe Doctrine and by the Act of Havana, with which you are familiar, and its defense against attack by a non-American power is plainly essential to the preservation of the peace and security of the American continent , and of the traditional policies of this Government respecting the Western Hemisphere .
My Government has consequently proposed measures for the adequate defense of Greenland consistent with the obligations of the United States under the Act of Havana signed on July 30 , 1940. In doing so it is animated by sentiments of the completest friendliness for Denmark, and believes that by taking these steps it is safeguarding the eventual re-establishment of the normal relationship between Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark.
I have the honor to enclose a draft of the proposed agreement relating to the defense of Greenland , which I believe embodies the ideas agreed upon in the course of our various conversations .
Accept, Sir, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration. CORDELL HULL

I have received your note of the seventh instant concerning the defense of Greenland together with a draft of a proposed agreement

regarding the same subject. It is with appreciation that I note your renewed assurance that,
although the present circumstances prevent the Government in Den-

mark for the time being from exercising its powers in respect of Greenland, your Government fully recognizes the Sovereignty of the Kingdom of Denmark over the island . At the same time I wish to convey

to you my feelings of gratitude for the expression of friendly concern of your Government and its earnest hope for the complete and speedy liberation of Denmark.

55 STAT. ] DENMARK-DEFENSE OF GREENLAND- APR . 9, 1941
I share your view that the proposed agreement, arrived at after an open and friendly exchange of views, is, under the singularly unusual circumstances , the best measure to assure both Greenland's present safety and the future of the island under Danish Sovereignty .
Furthermore, I am of the opinion that the terms of the agreement protect, as far as possible, the interests of the native population of Greenland whose welfare traditionally has been the paramount aim of Denmark's policy in Greenland.
I , therefore, shall accept and sign the agreement as proposed, acting on behalf of His Majesty, the King of Denmark, in His capacity of Sovereign over Greenland , whose authorities in Greenland have concurred herein .
I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to you, Mr. Secretary of State, the assurances of my highest consideration.
HENRIK KAUFFMANN The Honorable
CORDELL HULL, Secretary of State, Department of State, Washington D. C.

versations during the course of years, on the general subject of the Falls at Niagara, two objectives have been kept in mind : first , the

scenic beauty of this great heritage of the two countries ; and second, the utilization of the power resources available there, consistent with the primary obligation of preserving the scenic beauty of the Falls.
Recent surveys have indicated that there is now idle equipment available and set up which could utilize at once an additional diversion for power purposes of 5,000 cubic feet per second on the United States side. I am informed by the defense authorities of this Government and by the Federal Power Commission that this additional power is urgently needed in connection with the Government's Na-

tional Defense Program. It is likewise understood from conversa-

tions with the appropriate Canadian officials that 3,000 cubic feet per

second could be used immediately on the Canadian side in connection

with the furtherance of the war efforts of Canada . These figures

represent the immediate needs of the two Governments and do not

pretend to take into consideration all industrial requirements of the two countries in the area by reason of the present emergency.
In view of the above, and having in mind assurances of engineers that there will be no material adverse effect to the scenic beauty of

the Falls, I propose through this exchange of notes that for the duration of the emergency and in all events subject to reconsideration by both Governments on October 1 , 1942, an additional diversion for power purposes of 5,000 cubic feet per second be utilized on the United States side of the Niagara River above the Falls. In making

this proposal this Government is prepared to give assurances that no objection will be raised to an additional diversion of 3,000 cubic

feet per second on the Canadian side of the Niagara River above

SEÑOR SECRETARIO:
Tengo a honra manifestar a Vuestra Excelencia que mi Gobierno, basándose en el principio de reciprocidad , está muy interesado en que el Departamento del Tesoro de los Estados Unidos de América declare
formal y oficialmente que las entradas de las compañías navieras incorporadas bajo las leyes panameñas están exentas del impuesto sobre la renta .
Con la presente me es grato remitir a Vuestra Excelencia los documentos , debidamente autenticados, que contienen las disposiciones legales de la República de Panamá por las cuáles se exonera a las compañías navieras incorporadas bajo las leyes de los Estados Unidos de todo impuesto. Mucho le agradecería a Vuestra Excelencia que, si a bien lo tiene, haga llegar dichas disposiciones hasta el Departamento del Tesoro a fin de obtener la declaración deseada por mi Gobierno . Los documentos que se remiten son los siguientes :

a) folleto de edición oficial que contienen todas las leyes y decretos en que consta que la República de Panamá no impone contribuciones a la industria naviera de los Estados Unidos ;
b) copia de la Resolución Ejecutiva No. 33-bis, de 1936 , y c) certificado del señor Secretario de Estado en el Despacho de
Hacienda y Tesoro , en el cual se hace constar expresamente que "las naves mercantes de los Estados Unidos de América 6 de ciudadanos de ese país" están exentas del impuesto sobre la renta.

Las disposiciones legales contenidas en dichos documentos se pueden sintetizar como sigue:

1 ) Un gravamen es impuesto por la República de Panamá sobre las ganancias netas de todas las personas de acuerdo con la Ley del Fondo Obrero y del Agricultor, Ley 49 de 1934.

1364

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [ 55 STAT.

2 ) Por Resolución Ejecutiva No. 33-bis, del 2 de Marzo de 1936, fue resuelto lo siguiente:

"Las entradas que se derivan de las operaciones del comercio marítimo , de las naves mercantes de propiedad de corporaciones organizadas en los Estados Unidos de América ó de ciudadanos de ese 6 de cualquier otro país, que residan ya sea en Panamá ó en el exterior , no causan
el impuesto del Fondo del Obrero y del Agricultor creado por la Ley 49 de 1934 , aún cuando los contratos de transporte se celebren en Panamá".
3) La Asamblea Nacional de la República de Panamá, decretó en 1938 una nueva Ley de impuestos conocida por Ley No. 62 de 1938. Esta Ley no ha sido puesta en vigor por haber sido suspendida por el Decreto No. 41 del 5 de abril de 1939 y por el Decreto No. 146-bis del 30 de diciembre de 1939 .

En vista, pues, de todo lo arriba mencionado mi Gobierno vería

con mucho agrado que el Gobierno de Vuestra Excelencia diera la

seguridad de que, salvo cambios de la ley en el futuro , los ciudadanos

de la República de Panamá y sociedades incorporadas bajo las leyes

panameñas , han sido desde 1936 y serán después, exceptuadas del

impuesto sobre las ganancias derivadas de operaciones marítimas, conforme a lo provisto en las Secciones 211 (b) y 231 (d) del Código de Ingresos de los Estados Unidos de América (Internal Revenue Code of the United States of America) .

Sírvase Vuestra Excelencia aceptar mis gracias anticipadas por la

atención que se digne prestar a esta solicitud y las seguridades de mi

JANUARY 15 , 1941

MR. SECRETARY : I have the honor to inform Your Excellency that my Government,
upon the basis of the principle of reciprocity , is very much interested in having the Treasury Department of the United States of America declare formally and officially that the revenues of shipping companies incorporated under Panamanian laws are exempt from income taxes.

55 STAT. ] PANAMA- TAX ON SHIPPING PROFITS- Jan. 15, Feb. 8, 1941 Mar. 28, 1941

1365

I take pleasure in forwarding herewith to Your Excellency the documents , ['] duly authenticated , which contain the legal provisions of the Republic of Panama by which shipping companies incorporated under the laws of the United States are exempted from any tax. I should be very grateful if Your Excellency-provided you deem fit-would transmit the above-mentioned provisions to the Treasury Department in order to obtain the declaration desired by my Government. The documents which are being forwarded are the following:
a) officially issued booklet containing all the laws and decrees which show that the Republic of Panama does not impose taxes upon the shipping industry of the United States ;
b) copy of Executive Resolution No. 33-bis , of 1936 , and c) certificate of the Secretary of State in the Office of Hacienda
and Treasury, in which it is expressly stated that "the merchant ships of the United States of America or of citizens of that country" are exempt from the income tax.

The legal provisions to be found in the above-mentioned documents may be summarized as follows :
1 ) A tax is imposed by the Republic of Panama upon the net earnings of all persons in accordance with the "Ley del Fondo Obrero y del Agricultor," law 49 of 1934.
2) By Executive Resolution No. 33-bis, of March 2, 1936 , the following was decreed :
"Revenues which are derived from the operations of maritime commerce of merchant ships belonging to corporations organized in the United States of America or to citizens of that or any other country who reside either in Panama or abroad, are not subject to the tax of the "Fondo del Obrero y del Agricultor" created by law 49 of 1934, even though the transportation contracts may be drawn up in Panama".
3 ) The National Assembly of the Republic of Panama enacted in 1938 a new tax law known as law no . 62 of 1938. This law has not been put into force, due to its having been suspended by Decree No. 41 of April 5 , 1939 , and by Decree No. 146-bis of December 30 , 1939.

In view, therefore , of all that has been cited above, my Government

would be very much pleased if Your Excellency's Government would

give the assurance that, subject to changes of the law in the future,

the citizens of the Republic of Panama and firms incorporated under

Panamanian laws have been since 1936 and will henceforth be exempt from the tax on profits derived from maritime operations, as provided in sections 211 (b) and 231 (d) of the Internal Revenue Code of the

A letter has been received from the Treasury Department in which reference is made to the provisions of Executive Resolution No. 33-bis of March 2 , 1936 contained in the authenticated documents enclosed with the Embassy's note relating to the exemption of the

revenues derived from the operations of merchant ships from the tax

imposed by Panamanian Law 49 of 1934. It is stated in the letter

that these provisions " satisfy the equivalent exemption requirements of sections 212 (b) and 231 (d) of the Internal Revenue Code and the corresponding sections of the Revenue Act of 1938 and the Revenue Act of 1936 ". It is added that

"Consequently, nonresident alien individuals (including citizens of the Republic of Panama) and foreign corporations (including corporations organized under Panamanian laws) are exempt from Federal income tax with respect to their income which consists exclusively of earnings derived from the operation of a ship or ships documented under the laws of Panama, for the years 1936 to 1940 , inclusive. This ruling is equally applicable to subsequent years, as long as there remain in force and effect the provisions of the Executive Resolution No. 33-bis of March 2 , 1936, relative to the exemption from income tax of the revenues derived from the operations of merchant ships."

Accept, Excellency, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration.

MR. CHARGÉ D'AFFAIRES :
I have the honor to refer to your note no. 726 of April 19 , 1941 , relative to the conclusion of an agreement for rubber-culture investigations in Costa Rica, and to my note no. 1843 * B of the 16th instant, by which are accepted the terms of the agreement mentioned in your note with the exception, nevertheless , of the final part of paragraph (b) of article I , relative to the exemption from duties for the personal property brought into Costa Rica by the American employees upon their entry for work in the central experiment station in accordance with the terms of the agreement.

The deletion of this part of article I was for reasons which have already been verbally explained to you. However, as the services to be rendered by the personnel of the central experiment station for the cultivation of rubber can only be considered as an effective and gratuitous collaboration by your Government for the study of a new and reproductive product of our soil, I am certain that the Minister of Public Works, in collaboration with the Minister of Finance, will find a way to accommodate the Government of the United States of America in granting exemption of customs duties for the personal effects of the American employees of the said station which they may bring into Costa Rica at the time of their arrival, on condition that the director of the experiment station certify that such personal effects will not be resold.

I am pleased to take this opportunity to renew to you the sentiments of my most distinguished consideration.

"In view of the above, and having in mind assurances of engineers that there will be no material adverse effect to the scenic beauty of the Falls, I propose through this exchange of notes that for the duration of the emergency and in all events subject to reconsideration by both Governments on October 1 , 1942 , an additional diversion for power purposes of 5,000 cubic feet per second be utilized on the United States side of the Niagara River above the Falls. In making this proposal this Government is prepared to give assurances that no objection will be raised to an additional diversion of 3,000 cubic feet per second on the Canadian side of the Niagara River above the Falls. It is also proposed that the engineers of the two Governments be instructed to take such steps as may be necessary with a view to initiating forthwith the construction of works designed to distribute the flow of waters over the Falls in such a manner as to preserve their scenic beauty.
"Moreover, the American Government proposes that upon the entry into effect of the Agreement for the Utilization of the Water in the Great Lakes - St. Lawrence Basin signed on March 19 , 1941 , [ 2 ] the foregoing arrangements will be subject to the provisions of Article IX of the Agreement, and that it will be open

to the Commission appointed under the provisions of the Agreement and carrying out the duties imposed upon it, to take such action as may be necessary, and as may come within the Scope of the Agreement with regard to diversions at Niagara. "

I am advised by the defense authorities of this Government and by the Federal Power Commission that, notwithstanding the additonal diversions authorized in May, there is now a gravely urgent need for more power in the Niagara Falls area for manufacturing vitally necessary to the United States National Defense and Lease- Lend Programs. I understand that a similar need exists on the Canadian side.
On the United States side in this area there is idle equipment which could at once utilize an additional diversion for power purposes of 7,500 cubic feet per second. I understand that, on the Canadian side , the existing equipment is in the course of normal operations fully used only in daytime hours and that , if fully used during the night hours, it could utilize an additional diversion amounting, in the daily aggregate, to 6,000 cubic feet per second.
I propose therefore that , for the duration of the emergency and in any event subject to reconsideration on October 1 , 1942 :-

U. S. proposal.

1. The Canadian Government will raise no objection to an additional diversion for power purposes of 7,500 cubic feet per second, in terms of the daily aggregate, through existing facilities, on the United States side of the Niagara River above the Falls , and
2. The United States Government will raise no objection to an additional diversion for power purposes of 6,000 cubic feet per second, in terms of the daily aggregate, through existing facilities , on the Canadian side of the Niagara River above the Falls.

These diversions would be subject to an operating margin of one per- Operating margin.

cent of the total diversions whether authorized by this agreement or

otherwise, and could be exceeded to that extent in order to provide

for small excesses which may occur at times in the interest of efficient

operation . Upon acceptance of these proposals by your Government, it will be
even more important than it was earlier in the year to proceed with

the construction, in the 1942 open season, of remedial works. The

United States - St. Lawrence Advisory Committee and the Canadian Temporary Great Lakes - St. Lawrence Basin Committee (created

pursuant to the Exchange of Notes of October 14, 1940 ) [ ¹ ] should be

instructed immediately by the respective Governments to concert for the purpose of jointly recommending to the two Governments-- ( 1 )

the exact nature and design of the works that should be constructed in 1942, and ( 2 ) the allocation of the task of construction as between the

two Governments. Upon the recommendations being accepted by

the two Governments, and the acceptance notified to each other, the

construction would be undertaken pursuant to the recommendations. The total cost of the works would be divided equally between the two Governments regardless of the allocation of the task of construction.
The United States Government proposes further that upon the entry into effect of the Agreement for the Utilization of the Water in the Great Lakes - St. Lawrence Basin signed on March 19 , 1941 , the foregoing arrangements will be subject to the provisions of Article IX of the Agreement, and that it will be open to the Commission appointed under the provisions of the Agreement and carrying out the duties imposed upon it, to take such action as may be necessary, and as may come within the scope of the Agreement with regard to diversions at Niagara .

This assignment is agreed to between the United States and Canada as listed. Canada agrees to interpose no objection to an increase in the operating power of WFIL to 5kw with the radiation to Kirkland Lake on the bearing 338 degrees not to exceed 392 mv/m unattenuated at one mile (that produced by a nondirectional 5kw station having 175 mv/m at one mile for 1kw) . It is further agreed that the frequency 1220 kc will not be assigned within the United States for a reasonable time to permit assignment of CJKL to this frequency if the station should so elect. If subsequent investigations indicate the frequency 560 kc to be more desirable and CJ KL elects to remain on this channel under the aforementioned conditions, further use of the frequency 1220 kc in the northeastern por. tion of North America will be the subject offurther negotiations on the basis of established priorities.

Class II assignment with 500 watts in Mexico, D.F. , on the clear channel 660 kilocycles, occupied by WEAF, a Class I-A station in the United States, acceptable subject to directional antenna to protect the border of the United States in accordance with the engineering standards of the Treaty. It is recognized, under Part II, Section F, of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement, that "the engineering standards set forth in this Agreement are subject to revision when Justified by technical advances in the art" and that advances in the art of designing directional antennas permit reduction of the safety distance of 650 miles provided by Part II, C, Article 4 (b) of the Agreement to 400 miles when the propagation will take place over mountainous regions near the station and will not take place over seawater or along ideal paths between the Class II station and border of the country to which the Class I-A station on the channel is assigned, and when the most modern engineering development of antenna design and antenna control are utilized to avoid and prevent interference. Accordingly, the United States, in spite of its priority and other rights of use for a Class I-A station on this frequency, agrees to this revision of the safety distance of 650 miles provided by Part II, C, Article 4 (b) solely for stations installed in Mexico City and its contiguous area, it being understood that the permissible interfering signal from such Mexican stations shall not at any time exceed the values specified in Table I of Appendix II of the Agreement and that the United States may at any future time exercise its other rights under the Agreement with respect to the use of this frequency, without regard to any priorities resulting from the establishment of such Mexican stations.

This assignment is agreed to between the United States and Canada as listed. Canada agrees to interpose no objection to an increase in the operating power of WFIL to 5kw with the radiation to Kirkland Lake on the bearing 338 degrees not to exceed 392 mv/m unattenuated at one mile (that produced by a nondirectional 5kw station having 175 mv/m at one mile for 1kw) . It is further agreed that the frequency 1220 kc will not be assigned within the United States for a reasonable time to permit assignment of CJKL to this frequency if the station should so elect. If subsequent investigations indicate the frequency 560 kc to be more desirable and CJKL elects to remain on this channel under the aforementioned conditions, further use of the frequency 1220 kc in the northeastern portion of North America will be the subject offurther negotiations on the basis of established priorities.

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [55 STAT.

March 17 and June 6 and 17, 1941 [E. A. 8. 228]

Arrangement between the United States of America and Canada respecting joint committees on economic cooperation . Effected by aide-mémoire dated March 17 and June 6 and 17, 1941.

The Canadian Legation to the Department of State

AIDE-MEMOIRE

MARCH 17TH , 1941 .

The Canadian Government have been giving consideration to the military, economic and social problems which are likely to arise in Canada unless steps are taken to examine the possibility of arranging for co-operation between the war-expanded industries of Canada and the United States or for their co-ordination or integration . It is the belief of the Canadian Government that the promotion of economy and efficiency during the present period of crisis , the solution of the problems which will be posed during the period of transition from war to peace, and adequate and effective provision for the continuing requirements of hemispheric defence, all demand that early and detailed study be given to this question. Such a study might include an examination of the possibility and advisability of preventing duplication and mutually injurious competition by arranging for cooperation between the two countries in the further definition of all strategic, critical and essential war materials, and in the establishment of stock piles of certain of them.
In the opinion of the Canadian Government, the present channels of communication between Ottawa and Washington do not provide adequate facilities for the detailed consideration of so complicated and technical a subject. It is for this reason that the Canadian Government have decided to approach the Government of the United States with the proposal which is outlined in the attached memorandum . [ ' ] This memorandum was recently submitted to the War Committee of the Canadian Cabinet and received the approval of that body.
The Canadian Government attach great importance to the proposal . If it is accepted by the Government of the United States, they consider it desirable that an early start should be made by the Joint Committees of Inquiry, since the tasks to be assigned to them will inevitably involve protracted study. It is intended that the duties of the Committees should be strictly confined to investigation, study and report, and that decisions as to any action that may be required should be taken by the respective Governments after the Committees ' reports have been presented .
CANADIAN LEGATION, WASHINGTON, D. C. H. W.

Mar. 17, 1941 55 STAT. ] CANADA- ECONOMIC COOPERATION- June 6, 17, 1941
MEMORANDUM ON ECONOMIC COOPERATION WITH THE UNITED STATES
Pursuant to the approval of the War Committee of the Cabinet, on the recommendation of the Wartime Requirements Board , that a memorandum be drafted on a plan for exploring the possibility of a greater degree of economic cooperation with the United States in the war effort and in anticipating post-war economic consequences, we beg to submit the following:
1. The Problem
The objects of the proposal for increased economic cooperation with the United States are:
(a ) to effect a more economic, more efficient, and more coordinated utilization of the combined resources of the two countries in the production of war requirements, and
(b) to minimize the probable post-war economic disequilibrium consequent upon the changes which the economy in each country is presently undergoing.
2. Joint Committees of Inquiry
We recommend that , for purposes of preliminary study, an informal committee of three persons be appointed by each Government. These committees should separately and collectively analyze the problems involved and report thereon as well as on the form of a more permanent organization , if the necessity of such an organization arises from their report. The reports should be made to the President of the United States, and to the Prime Minister of Canada , respectively.
Of the three members of the Canadian committee, we recommend that at least two be designated by the Department of Munitions and Supply, and one by the Department of Finance . In addition to these three members , it is suggested that a liaison officer, representing the Department of External Affairs , should be appointed in order that the Secretary of State for External Affairs may be kept closely in touch with the activities of the committee . It is assumed that the United States will wish to appoint a similar liaison officer from the State Department, in order that the Secretary of State may be kept similarly informed. It is not intended that the liaison officers should be members of the committee or should participate in its work.
We desire to stress the importance of care being exercised in the selection of the personnel of the committee, having due regard to its functions which will involve a great deal of research and analysis .
3. Subject Matter of Study
We recommend that the Joint Committees of Inquiry explore the following subjects and report thereon :
(a) The making of an inventory of the available supplies of materials in each country, an analysis of the probable needs for them, and the allocation of these materials between the two countries, with due regard to the necessary priorities ;
278941 °-42-PT. II- 36

1445

1446

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [ 55 STAT.

(b) The policy of building up inventories of strategic or critical materials , such as rubber, tin, and steel alloys, and the amounts to be accumulated in each country, with special regard to materials of which the supply might be cut off because of unfavourable developments ;
(c) The possibility, in some degree, of each country specializing in the production of finished and semi-finished articles which it can produce more economically and to greater advantage ;
(d) The possibility, in some degree, of each country specializing in the production of materials ; e . g. , chemicals, steel, aluminum, brass , zinc, etc. , etc. , which it can produce more economically and to greater advantage.
(e) The most economic and efficient use of the shipping and port facilities of the two countries ;
(f) The available power supply and the supply of coal and oil in each country ;
(g) The exchange of technical knowledge relating to production , and the exchange of technicians between the two countries .
(h) Coordination of priority policies in each country. (i) The exchange of information relating to the requirements of labour, materials and plant for production, and of current information relating to actual and anticipated production.

Subject to the approval of the Minister of Munitions and Supply, the committees might also consider the allocation of the output of machine tools in the two countries , and the specialization on machine tool production in each country.

February 25th, 1941.

The Department of State to the Canadian Legation
AIDE-MEMOIRE
The Government of the United States has given careful and sympathetic consideration to the suggestion made by the Canadian Government in its Aide-Memoire dated March 17th, 1941 , transmitted to the Department of State through the Canadian Legation at Washington . Note has been taken of the belief of the Canadian Government that early and detailed study should be given to the possibility of arranging for cooperation between the war-expanded industries of Canada and the United States, or for their coordination or integration ; and also of the belief of the Canadian Government that such a study might assist in promoting economy and efficiency during the present period of crisis , and during the period of transition from war to peace, and also in connection with the continuing requirements of hemispheric defense .

55 STAT. ]

Mar. 17, 1941 CANADA-ECONOMIC COOPERATION-
June 6, 17, 1941

1447

The Government of the United States agrees with the Canadian Government that present channels of communication between Ottawa and Washington would not provide adequate facilities for detailed consideration of certain of the subjects presented in the Aide Memoire of March 17th under reference, as further developed by the Memorandum on Economic Cooperation with the United States attached thereto . Developments occurring subsequent to the date of that note have, however, taken care of certain of the problems dealt with in the note under reference. More especially, direct contact has already been established between the officials of the Government of the United States and of the Government of Canada charged with priorities , and with production of war material . It would accordingly appear that a number of the topics mentioned in the "Memorandum on Economic Cooperation with the United States" are already being dealt with.
It is not considered desirable to entrust to the proposed committees jurisdiction over these specific contacts already established , except as the committees may from time to time, from their knowledge of the situation, feel it desirable to make recommendations .
The long range aspects of the problem, both those during the present emergency and those comprehended in the numbered paragraph (b) of the Aide-Memoire under reference, do not appear to be covered by existing arrangements .
Recognizing that the suggestion made by the Canadian Government has great importance, the Government of the United States agrees that joint committees of inquiry should be appointed to explore, subject to the foregoing observations, the possibility of a greater degree of economic cooperation between Canada and the United States,
"(a) To effect a more economic, more efficient and more coordinated utilization of the combined resources of the two countries in
the production of defense requirements " (to the extent that this is not now being done) ; and
"(b) To minimize the probable post-war economic disequilibrium consequent upon the changes which the economy in each country is presently undergoing. "
Tentative designaTo that end the Government of the United States has tentatively tion of U. S. Comdesignated the following Committee: Mr. William L. Batt ; Mr. mittee. Harry D. White ; Professor Alvin H. Hansen ; and Mr. E. Dana Durand. If acceptable to the Canadian Government, the Government of the United States proposes to reserve the right to name Mr. A. A. Berle, Jr. to sit with the committees from time to time, as occasion may render desirable ; and it is prepared to name Mr. L. D. Stinebower as liaison officer in order that the Secretary of State may be kept closely in touch with the activities of the committees. The Government of the United States believes that the joint committees of inquiry should be given latitude to add to the specific list contained in the memorandum submitted by the Canadian Govern-

20

1448

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [55 STAT.

ment such other topics as may appear properly to fall within the terms of reference implicit in the statement of the problem to be explored.
It is understood that the Canadian Government is prepared to appoint its committee of inquiry. Upon notification of the appointment of such committee, the Government of the United States will be happy to have it proceed to Washington, and to make arrangements permitting prompt undertaking of the work.

DEPARTMENT OF STATE, Washington, June 6, 1941

The Canadian Legation to the Department of State

AIDE MEMOIRE

The Government of Canada have learned with satisfaction that the

Government of the United States are prepared to participate in the Economic Enquiry which was the subject of the Canadian Legation's aide memoire of March 17th, 1941 , and of the Department of State's reply of June 6th , 1941. They are in general agreement with the proposals outlined in the Department of State's aide memoire of June 6th .

The Government of Canada have designated the following Committee:

Designation of Canadian Committee.

Mr. R. A. C. Henry, Economics Adviser to the Minister of Munitions and Supply ;

Professor W. A. Mackintosh , Special Assistant to the Deputy Minister of Finance ;

Mr. D. A. Skelton , Chief of the Research Department, Bank of Canada; and

Mr. J. G. Bouchard, Assistant Deputy Minister of Agriculture.

If it is acceptable to the Government of the United States, the Government of Canada propose that the arrangement whereby the Honourable A. A. Berle , Jr. , should meet with the Committees from time to time as occasion may render desirable should be extended likewise to Mr. H. L. Keenleyside of the Department of External Affairs.

Tengo el honor de referirme a las estipulaciones del convenio comercial suplementario entre nuestros dos países firmado hoy en La Habana, que establece un tipo de derechos reducidos sobre azúcar de origen cubano que se importe en los Estados Unidos de América.
Con vista de la vital importancia que las exportaciones de azúcar tienen para la economía de Cuba , y de la posición predominante de los Estados Unidos como mercado para el azúcar de Cuba, mi Gobierno desea que se considere lo grave de la posibilidad de que se adopten en los Estados Unidos de América, en cualquier tiempo, medidas que pudieran afectar adversamente la situación de Cuba como abastecedora de azúcar al mercado de los Estados Unidos , en comparación con las que se establecen en las estipulaciones de la Ley Azucarera de 1937, ya que mi Gobierno estima que tales medidas anularían los fines de este Convenio y de las relaciones comerciales existentes.

MINISTRY OF STATE

Habana, December 23, 1941.

EXCELLENCY : I have the honor to refer to the provisions of the supplementary
trade agreement between our two countries signed at Habana this day, which establishes a reduced rate of duty on sugar of Cuban origin

imported into the United States .

In view of the vital importance of sugar exports to the economy of

Cuba, and of the predominant position of the United States as a

market for Cuban sugar, my Government desires that consideration

be given to the gravity of the possibility of the adoption of measures

at any time in the United States which might adversely affect the

position of Cuba as a supplier of sugar for the United States market,

as compared with those established by the provisions of the Sugar Act of 1937 , inasmuch as my Government considers that such measures would nullify the objectives of this agreement and of the existing commercial relations .

50 Stat. 903. 7 U. 8. C. §§ 1100-
1183.

I should appreciate receiving from Your Excellency such assurances in this regard as may be appropriate.

I take this opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the assurances of my highest consideration .

assure Your Excellency that the interest of your Government in maintaining the position of the Republic of Cuba as a supplier of sugar for the United States market, at least in the same proportion as provided for in the Sugar Act of 1937 , which is considered of vital importance to the maintenance of the existing economic relations between both

countries, is fully appreciated , and that therefore my Government will make at all times every appropriate and possible effort to safeguard that position .

part of the supplementary trade agreement signed this day . Please accept, Excellency, the renewed assurances of my highest

DECLARATIONS

I

STATEMENT WITH REGARD TO THE INTER-AMERICAN RADIOCOMMUNICATION CONVENTION .

THE SECOND INTER-AMERICAN RADIO CONFERENCE, in considering the propositions presented by some of the governments there represented and intended to introduce reforms in the Convention subscribed at Havana , Cuba , in December, 1937, formulates the following :
That it confirms fully the authority of the Conference to modify, in whole or in part, the Convention , within the limitations imposed thereby, and by the accompanying Regulation ;
That, with the object of avoiding improvisations in codified instruments, the proposals providing for reform of the Convention must be studied carefully and sufficiently in advance ;
That in accordance with such a principle, all the propositions presented at the present Conference will be referred for consideration to the next Conference, which must render a decision concerning them ;
That any new proposal for reform of the Convention must be referred to the following Conference, at least six months before the corresponding sessions commence , with a brief statement regarding the reasons ;
That notwithstanding the principles enunciated , it recognizes the immediate necessity of making the following clarifications with regard to the Convention :

54 Stat. 2514.

Article 6 : It is recognized, in this article, that the consultative character of the O. I. R. is not such as to authorize an initiative in
consultations and reports, but only such as to permit it to effect the exchange of data and to facilitate consultations which the
American countries may arrange among themselves , and always provided that they deem it desirable to do so through it as intermediary . Article 7 : It is recognized that the extent of the powers of the O. I. R. is limited to the work of the conferences themselves , and to the work growing out of these conferences . The O. I. R., which is obviously an exchange office, may not interpret or take the initiative in the application of the Convention , Agreement, or Recommendations. Article 7 of Annex No. 2 : It is recognized that any government may change the category in which it appears , in which case the change will become effective in the annual period following that in which notification is given.

This declaration will be included in the Final Act of the Second Inter-American Radio Conference .

II
UNIFORMITY OF TIME AND TIME SIGNALS IN THE AMERICAN CONTINENT.
The Second Inter-American Radiocommunications Conference would view with approval the adoption of Standard Zone Time by the American countries which have not already done so , with the hope that such may be accomplished within a reasonable period , and that at the same time there will be adopted a uniform code system for broadcasting radio time signals .

RECOMMENDATIONS

The Second Inter-American Radio Conference recommends to the American countries :
I
SHORT-WAVE BROADCASTING

With the purpose of reaching an agreement for the more efficient use of short-wave channels in the frequency bands assigned to broadcasting, between 6000 and 28000 kc, the Second Inter-American Radio Conference , taking into account existing high-frequency broadcasting conditions throughout the world, recommends that those American countries which have not yet done so , reorganize their short-wave broadcasting services, using as a basis for this, the most modern and efficient standards of radio technique .
Based upon the results obtained in the course of these studies in each country, the next Inter-American Conference will be in a position to make recommendations for allocations which will provide for the requirements of each country of the Americas, proceeding later, at an International Conference, to incorporate them in the worl allocation structure.
II

ESTABLISHMENT OF MONITORING STATIONS
To comply with Articles 13 and 14 of the Inter-American Radiocommunications Convention concerning the checking of frequencies by means of the establishment of monitoring stations in each country and the direct exchange of the corresponding technical information between the Governments or between these monitoring stations, according to the Administrative procedure of each country .

53 Stat. 1596, 1597.

III

FREEDOM OF RADIOCOMMUNICATIONS

That, in order further to improve the friendly relations already existing between the American nations, they reaffirm reciprocally, the legitimate principle of freedom in radiocommunications authorized to supply a public service, in conformity with the existing legislation of the several countries and with international agreements on the subject .

1494

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [55 STAT.
IV
EXCHANGE OF BROADCAST PROGRAM SCHEDULES
It is recommended that authorized radiobroadcasting organizations of the interested countries , exchange, sufficiently in advance, programs of their broadcasts, especially all those relating to important national or international events. In this case, it is recommended that telegraph or telephone be utilized , if necessary, to thus assure receipt with sufficient time for appropriate publicity and its retransmission, as far as possible.
V
STATION IDENTIFICATION FOR S.W. BROADCASTING STATIONS
It is recommended that those American countries which wish to do so, identify the distinctive calls of shortwave broadcasting stations by means of letters of the alphabet and numerals . Such identification may consist of two or more letters which may be followed by one or more numbers, indicating the frequency of transmission .
If possible, preference should be given to the use of three letters and three or four numerals. In this case, the first two letters will identify the country, the third letter the city or district, and the numerals , the frequency in kilocycles per second, eliminating the final figure.
It is further recommended that this identification be transmitted in the English, Spanish, Portuguese and French languages.
VI
INTERCHANGE OF METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION .
Considering :
1. That to date it has not been possible to achieve an effective coordination between all the countries of America for the purpose of exchanging synoptic meteorological information ;
2. That in order to obtain such a result it is indispensable to coordinate meteorological and radioelectric services ;
it is recommended :
a) that, at the time the joint meetings of the Regional III and IV Commissions of Meteorology are held in Washington in 1941 , there be included also technical representation of official radioelectric organizations in order to establish a definite Inter-American plan for centralizing and exchanging meteorological reports and other related data ;
b) that, with six months anticipation , the radioelectric organizations send the forementioned regional commissions information relative to available radiocommunication facilities in accordance with the questionnaire annexed hereto, and also any other data of possible interest in order to guide the preliminary work of the joint meetings ;
c) that the Government of Chile advise the Regional Commissions III and IV of the above recommendations.

55 STAT. ] INTER-AMERICAN-RADIO COMMUNICATIONS-JAN. 26, 1940

1495

Immediate Possibilities

Future Prospects

(1) Indicate approximate date of accomplishment.

VII

ROUTE FREQUENCIES PROVIDED BY THE GENERAL RADIO REGULATIONS.

a) That every effort be made to shift at the earliest practicable moment the aeronautical mobile services of the air routes to those frequencies which were allocated by the Cairo General Radio Regulations for these particular routes .
b) that the Cairo Inter-American route frequencies be not employed within national boundaries except wherein required for services to the air routes between the countries of the Americas .
c) that all of the installations at present available for the needs of the security of Inter-American flights should be maintained in effect until replaced or no longer required because of other adequate provisions .

54 Stat. 1417.

VIII
ADDITIONAL FREQUENCIES BELOW 6000 KC REQUIRED FOR INTERCONTINENTAL AIR ROUTES

a) That, insofar as possible, all the American countries should select the same frequencies for use throughout any given InterAmerican route ;
b) that short distance frequencies be provided to supplement the long distance frequencies assigned by the General Radio Regulations to the Inter-continental air routes in order to insure aeronautical route communications at all distances .

1496

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [55 STAT.

c) that there be provided adequate frequencies for local aeronautical communications at route terminals and intermediate airports .
d) that it be permitted , in the meantime, to continue the use of the frequencies 5692.5 , 5405 , 3082.5 , 2870 and 1638 kc which are actually assigned to aircraft and aeronautical stations on the Inter-American route.

IX

Considering :

AIR-GROUND COMMUNICATIONS

1.- that it is essential to institute a security organization (which may involve coordination between various agencies, both govern-

ment and non-government in nature) comprising services for radio-communication, radio-guidance, traffic control and the safe-guarding of aircraft ; 2.- that it will result in confusion if a multiplicity of ground aeronautical stations at one time take on the responsibility of communications concerning the security of a given aircraft , and that this will also result in radio disturbances ;

3.- that under certain conditions it may be difficult to keep watch simultaneously on more than one radio frequency on board aircraft ;

4.- that it is necessary to economize in the number of frequencies employed and in their use ;

it is recommended :

a) that each of the various air traffic lanes which can be considered as constituting an Inter-American air route, in the sense in which this expression is defined for the distribution of the radio frequencies in the General Radio Regulations of Cairo, be divided into sectors of control , each sector being allocated to a station serving such route ;
b) that, in principle, the boundary of a sector of control is the middle of the distance separating the station to which such sector is allocated, from the station controlling the following sector of the same lane ;
c) that, for a given flight, the exact point where the transfer of communications control from one station to the next will be effected is determined by an agreement between the ground stations concerned, and the aircraft.

X
POINT-TO-POINT COMMUNICATIONS OF THE AERONAUTICAL SERVICES Considering : 1.- that the establishment of sectors of control might necessitate the
employment of a rapid and adequate fixed communications service between control stations ;

55 STAT. ] INTER-AMERICAN-RADIO COMMUNICATIONS- JAN. 26, 1940

1497

2.- that it might happen that frequencies allocated to routes by the General Radio Regulations of Cairo do not permit of insuring the necessary volume of traffic between fixed points , as well as all the essential communications with aircraft ;
3.- that the aeronautical services are not prohibited by the General Radio Regulations to use frequencies in the bands allocated to the fixed services for communication between fixed points.
it is recommended :

54 Stat. 1417.

a) that a rapid and effective radio communications service be established between control stations of the same lane, either between adjacent stations on the one hand, or between terminal stations on the other . For this purpose, at least two series of frequencies will have to be provided according to the distances to be covered and for day and night operations ;
b) that long distance communications between control stations be strictly reduced to the exchange of messages relating to the security of aircraft and to the regularity of flights ;
c) that each government examine the possibility of providing for the use of fixed service aeronautical stations , suitable frequencies in the bands allocated to the fixed services, which will insure a rapid transmission of the traffic necessary to control stations with which a direct radio communication will be required . The frequencies found to be available as a result of this examination will be placed at the disposal of all. It is expected that the contribution of each country of the frequencies will be proportionate in number to its interest in the service.
d) that transmissions made by a special aeronautical station and intended for reception by one or more other such stations serving long trans-oceanic air routes and situated at distances appropriate to the propagation characteristics of the frequency band in use at a given time, shall be conducted on the same radio frequency.
e) that frequencies allocated to routes or frequencies chosen for aeronautical fixed service should not be employed for meteorological messages which might be broadcast more economi-
cally in general broadcasts or by other means ; f) that to this end the countries participating in this Conference
should prepare and exchange not later than March 1 , 1941 , pertinent data which may be of value.

XI
STUDY OF THE NEEDS OF THE AERONAUTICAL SERVICES FOR ADDITIONAL FREQUENCIES
Considering : a) that the domestic and international aeronautical services have been
marked by a steady growth and that they will undoubtedly continue to expand rapidly ;

1498 54 Stat. 1417. 54 Stat. 1417.

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [55 STAT.
b) that it would be desirable to have supplementary data regarding the radio needs of the aeronautical services in the Western Hemisphere ;
recommends :
1.- that a study should be made with a view of obtaining at the earliest practicable date a reasonable number of additional channels for the aeronautical services , should these additional channels be found necessary ;
2.- that to this end the countries participating in this Conference should prepare and exchange before March 1 , 1941 , all pertinent data which may be of value in formulating definite proposals for consideration at the next International Telecommunications Conference . XII
DIVISION OF TIME IN THE USE OF ROUTE FREQUENCIES
Considering : that the Inter-continental Route Frequencies are for the joint use by aircraft and aeronautical stations of all countries and the General Radio Regulations of Cairo do not as yet cover all phases of radio operating procedures in the aeronautical services, such as division of operating time in the use of route frequencies ;
it is recommended :
that a study be made to determine what additional radio regulations should be prescribed for the international aeronautical services ; that any additional radio regulations for the aeronautical services be coordinated with the existing regulations both international and of each individual nation governing the mobile services in general.
XIII
STABILIZED TRANSMITTING FREQUENCIES IN THE VARIOUS BANDS
Considering :
1.- that the new tolerances fixed by the General Regulations of Cairo will probably require the employment of automatic frequency control devices ;
2.- that the possible use of all the frequencies designated in each band for each intercontinental line would necessitate the provision of a large number of frequencies ;
it is recommended :
a) that as a temporary measure, aircraft transmitters should , if necessary, be capable of transmitting on two fixed frequencies in each band ;
b) that information be exchanged on the methods employed to attain the necessary stability requirements .

55 STAT. ] INTER-AMERICAN- RADIO COMMUNICATIONS-JAN. 26, 1940
XIV
AIRCRAFT RADIO EQUIPMENT (GENERAL). Considering :
that the joint use of the Intercontinental Route Frequencies introduces new problems of equipment design because of the necessarily more rigid tolerances governing such regulatory matters as frequency stability, band-change, quick frequency shift, etc. it is recommended :
that the competent aeronautical and radio consultative bodies be asked to prepare appropriate technical and performance recommendations in all matters upon which standardization appears to be desirable and practicable such as for example: a) Minimum number of frequency bands which should be covered by aircraft radio equipment and a study of the specific frequency bands to be covered. b) Minimum number of stabilized frequencies which should be provided . c) Band-change and frequency-change requirements. d) Transmitter and receiver calibration standardization. e) Minimum transmitter power and receiver sensitivity.
XV
RADIO EQUIPMENT FOR AERONAUTICAL CONTROL STATIONS
It is recommended :
a) that a study be made of the minimum radio facilities for control stations of air navigation serving the inter-continental air routes ;
b) that there be undertaken an exchange of all information relative to existing installations at each base.
XVI
RADIO AIDS TO AIR NAVIGATION .
STANDARDS OF FIELD STRENGTH AND INTERFERENCE RATIOS.
The Second Inter-American Radio Conference resolves :
1.- that the countries of the Western Hemisphere should exchange all available pertinent data on the following subjects : a) Lists of various types of radio aids to air navigation which have been approved for service operation. b) Information on minimum signal intensities required for satisfactory reception of the various types of radio aids to air navigation .

1499

1500

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [55 STAT.
c) Permissible values of interfering signal strength for the various types of radio aids to air navigation expressed in ratios of desired to undesired signal measured at the minimum signal contour (a) on the same frequency, and (b) on frequencies removed therefrom by specified numbers of kilocycles.
2.- that radio aids to air navigation , especially those which are of a one-way or broadcast nature, such as radiobeacons, should maintain the highest possible standards of reliability , stability and quality of emissions .
3.- as far as possible , all nations should reserve the same wave bands for similar types of service in order to simplify radio equipment design and through such standardization extend the geographical limits of usefulness of aircraft radio equipment.
4.- that the power radiated by radio aids to air navigation in the authorized frequencies bands should be consistent with the normal required signal intensity within the area in which it is desired to render service.

XVII

AIR NAVIGATIONAL AIDS.

It is recommended:

that inasmuch as the next world aeronautical radio conference

will probably consider the standardization on a world-wide

basis of reduced visibility radio landing devices for aircraft ,

information be exchanged between the governments which

have conducted experimentation on devices of this nature,

and also between other governments signatory to this agree-

ment.

EXPLANATORY NOTE

The resolutions and new questions dealing with aeronautical communications are the result of discussions which used as a basis some of the recommendations drafted by the Subcommission of the Third World Conference of Aeronautical Radio Experts which met at Krakow, Poland, in May 1939.

XVIII

AMATEURS (GENERAL) .
It is recommended :
a) Require amateurs operating radiotelephonic services in the band. 14000 to 14400 kc to go through a period of preliminary training assuring a minimum of experience in order to insure the efficient use of this band.
b) Prohibit the employment of amateur stations, both fixed and mobile, from rendering a broadcasting service, and make every effort to limit operations to specific purposes , without invading the sphere of activity that properly belongs to other radio services .

55 STAT. ] INTER-AMERICAN-RADIO COMMUNICATIONS -JAN. 26, 1940

1501

c) that the organizations of amateurs on the American Continent reach an agreement among themselves through their respective Governments to establish and propose at the next InterAmerican Conference a continental plan for the sub-division of the bands among the various types of emission.
ANNEX (See Art. VI) .
TECHNICAL STANDARDS IN CONNECTION WITH THE SUPPRESSION OF INTERFERENCE CAUSED BY ELECTRICAL APPARATUS.
SUPPRESSION OF INTERFERENCE CAUSED BY ELECTRICAL APPARATUS.
1.- Diathermy apparatus, induction field heaters , carrier call systems, and similar non-radio apparatus which uses radio frequency currents as an essential to their operation, may be a serious source of interference to radio-communications.
2. The use of such apparatus has an important place in therapeutics, surgery, industry etc.
3. The radiation of radio energy is not essential to the proper functioning of the apparatus and can be prevented or controlled without impairing the usefulness of the apparatus for its intended purpose.
4. The radiation takes place generally from the output circuit, internal circuits or power supply connection , all of which are essential elements.
5. The extent of the radiation depends upon the operating frequency or frequencies, power, and the design, installation and operating of the apparatus.
6. The radiation through the power supply connection can be prevented by means of a shielded transformer or a line filter. Radiation from the internal circuits can be prevented by means of suitable metallic cases. The radiation from the output circuits can be reduced to a level so as not to cause interference to radio communications by means of suitable metallic shielding, if the shielding encloses the entire apparatus and is of sufficient dimensions that large eddy currents are not produced in the shield . Aluminium foil paper and well-bonded copper screening have been successfully employed for shielding of rooms enclosing diathermy apparatus.
7.- The frequencies used for such apparatus may be any frequency in the useful radio spectrum. However, many diathermy units (which cause most long-distance radio interference) operate in frequencies from approximately 10000 to 25000 kilocycles. Operations on other frequencies mainly cause interference to local or moderate distance reception.
8.- The usual diathermy machine is essentially a radio transmitter of the self-excited oscillating type and generally uses self-rectifying plate power supply. Due to the inherent instability of the oscilator circuits, and the different uses to which the output circuit is subject, the operating frequency will vary during normal operation over very wide bands , provided automatic frequency control equipment is not incorporated.

Ante, p. 1487.

1502

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [55 STAT.
9. All diathermy machines designed for the same service can operate on the same frequency without impairing their usefulness , since their operation is not affected by radiation from other machines. Operation on a specific frequency with a very close frequency tolerance is practicable, with little added cost . It is understood that the present design of diathermy equipment has to a great extent gravitated to frequencies above approximately 12 megacycles, hence it is recommended that the subscribing countries consider requiring all diathermy machines to use not more than two frequencies in harmonic relation above 12 megacycles which will not interfere with existing radio assignments. The harmonic relationship between the two frequencies provides a further guarantee against interference to radio-communication .
10. Standards of good engineering practice are believe to be practicable at the present time and consideration of the adoption by the governments of such standards at the earliest practicable date is recommended . The standards should include the following subjects:
a) Frequencies to be used . b) Automatic frequency control. c ) Frequency stability. d) Type of emission . e) Maximum power output. f) Harmonic radiation to be effectively suppressed. g) Internal circuits to be effectively shielded . h) Radiation from power supply connection to be eliminated.
11.- Where diathermy apparatus does not comply with the standards whichmay be adopted by the subscribing countries should consider the desirability of requiring such apparatus to be operated in a properly shielded room.
12. Such apparatus as carrier call systems and certain types of induction furnaces and similar apparatus using medium or low frequencies should be required to restrict the generation of harmonics and make the necessary test to determine that radiation of signal does not result beyond a prescribed level .
13. The interested administrations will interchange all information
concerning the solution of the problem created by the serious interference caused by diathermy apparatus to radio communications

RECOMENDACIONES
La Segunda Conferencia Interamericana de Radiocomunicaciones ,
RECOMIENDA
a los países americanos: I
RADIODIFUSIÓN EN ONDAS CORTAS
Con el objeto de llegar a un acuerdo para el empleo más eficiente de los canales de onda corta en las bandas de frecuencia asignadas a la radiodifusión , 6000 a 28000 Kc/s . la Segunda Conferencia Interamericana de Radiocomunicaciones, tomando en consideración las condiciones existentes en todo el mundo respecto de la radiodifusión en alta frecuencia, recomienda a aquellos países americanos que aún no lo han hecho, reorganizar sus servicios de radiodifusión en onda corta, ajustándose para ésto a las normas más modernas y eficientes de la técnica radioeléctrica.
Basada en los resultados que se alcancen en el curso de dichos. estudios en cada país, la próxima Conferencia Interamericana estaría en situación de hacer recomendaciones acerca de asignaciones que cubran las necesidades de cada país de las Américas, procediendo más tarde en una Conferencia Internacional a incorporarlas a la estructura universal de asignaciones .
II
ESTABLECIMIENTO DE PUESTOS DE CONTRALOR
Dar cumplimiento a los artículos 13 y 14 de la Convención Interamericana de Radiocomunicaciones, sobre verificación de las frecuencias mediante el establecimiento de puestos de contralor en cada país y el intercambio directo entre los Gobiernos , o entre dichos puestos, de acuerdo con la práctica administrativa de cada país , de las informaciones técnicas correspondientes .
III
LIBERTAD EN LAS RADIOCOMUNICACIONES
Que, a fin de intensificar las relaciones amistosas existentes entre las naciones americanas, éstas reafirman, en forma recíproca, el principio legítimo de la libertad en las radiocomunicaciones autorizadas para efectuar un servicio público , de acuerdo con las legislaciones vigentes en los respectivos países y con los convenios internacionales sobre la materia.

55 STAT. ] INTER-AMERICAN-RADIO COMMUNICATIONS-JAN. 26, 1940
IV
INTERCAMBIO DE PROGRAMAS SOBRE RADIODIFUSIÓN
Se recomienda que las organizaciones de Radiodifusión de los países interesados, debidamente autorizadas, intercambien con la debida anticipación los programas correspondientes a sus emisiones , sobre todo los relacionados con importantes acontecimientos nacionales o internacionales . En este caso se recomienda hacer uso del telégrafo o del teléfono , si fuere necesario, a fin de asegurar el recibo con tiempo suficiente para la apropiada publicidad y su retransmisión, en cuanto sea posible.
V
SEÑALES DISTINTIVAS PARA ESTACIONES DE RADIODIFUSIÓN EN ONDA CORTA.
Se recomienda a los países americanos, que lo deseen , identificar los distintivos de las estaciones de radiodifusión de onda corta por medio de letras y números . Tal identificación podrá consistir en dos o más letras , que pueden ser seguidas por uno o más números , que indiquen la frecuencia de la transmisión.
Si fuera posible, deberá darse preferencia al uso de tres letras y de tres o cuatro números . En este caso las dos primeras letras identificarían el país ; la tercera letra la zona o ciudad y los números la frecuencia en kilociclos por segundo , eliminando la última cifra.
Se recomienda, además, que esta identificación sea transmitida en los idiomas Inglés , Castellano, Portugués y Francés.
VI
INTERCAMBIO DE INFORMACIONES METEOROLÓGICAS
Considerando :
1.- Que hasta la fecha no ha sido posible obtener una coordinación efectiva entre todos los países de América para realizar el intercambio adecuado de informaciones meteorológicas, sinópticas ;
2.- que para arribar a tal resultado es indispensable una coordinación de los servicios meteorológicos y radioeléctricos .
Se recomienda:
8.- que en oportunidad de celebrarse en Washington en 1941 la reunión conjunta de las Comisiones Regionales III y IV de Meteorología, se realice una reunión mixta de técnicos de los organismos radioeléctricos oficiales a fin de establecer un plan interamericano definitivo sobre las cuestiones vinculadas con la centralización e intercambio de informes meteorológicos y demás problemas conexos ;
b.- que con una anticipación de seis meses los organismos radioeléctricos envíen a las Comisiones Regionales mencionadas informes relativos a sus posibilidades de acuerdo con el cuestionario anexo , como así todo otro dato de posible interés a fin de orientar los trabajos preliminares de las reuniones mixtas.

VII
FRECUENCIAS DE RUTA PROVISTAS POR EL REGLAMENTO GENERAL DE RADIOCOMUNICACIONES
a) Que se hagan todos los esfuerzos posibles para cambiar, tan pronto sea practicable, los servicios móviles aeronáuticos de las rutas aéreas a las frecuencias que les fueren asignadas por el Reglamento General de Radiocomunicaciones de El Cairo para dichas rutas ;
b) que las frecuencias señaladas en El Cairo para las rutas interamericanas no sean empleadas dentro de las fronteras nacionales con excepción de los casos en que sean usadas para servir rutas aéreas entre países de América ;
c) que todas las instalaciones disponibles en la actualidad para las necesidades de seguridad en los vuelos interamericanos sean mantenidas en funcionamiento hasta ser reemplazadas o que por haberse tomado otras disposiciones adecuadas, ya no sean necesarias .

55 STAT. ] INTER-AMERICAN-RADIO COMMUNICATIONS-JAN. 26, 1940
VIII
FRECUENCIAS ADICIONALES IN- FERIORES A 6000 Kc/s . REQUERIDAS PARA RUTAS AÉREAS INTERCONTINENTALES
a) ue, en la medida de sus posibilidades, todas las administraciones americanas elijan las mismas frecuencias para ser empleadas durante todo el curso de una ruta intercontinental dada ;
b) que se provean frecuencias de corta distancia para complementar las frecuencias de larga distancia asignadas por el Reglamento General de Radiocomunicaciones a las rutas aéreas intercontinentales con el objeto de asegurar comunicaciones aeronáuticas por rutas a cualquier distancia ;
c) que se provean frecuencias adecuadas para comunicaciones aeronáuticas locales en los terminales de rutas y puertos aéreos intermediários .
d) que sea permitido , mientras tanto, continuar utilizando las frecuencias de 5692.5 , 5405 , 3082.5 , 2870 y 1638 Kc/s . que actualmente estuvieran asignadas a aeronaves y estaciones aeronáuticas en la ruta interamericana.
IX
COMUNICACIONES ENTRE AERONAVES Y TIERRA
Considerando :
1.-Que la institución de una organización de seguridad es esencial (que puede comprender coordinación entre varias entidades , de naturaleza tanto gubernativas como nó gubernativas) comprendiendo servicios para la comunicación por radio , dirección por radio , control de tráfico y la seguridad en la protección de naves aéreas ;
2.-que resultaría una confusión si , a un mismo tiempo , múltiples estaciones aeronáuticas de tierra tomaran sobre si la responsabilidad de comunicaciones referentes a la seguridad de una aeronave dada, y que esto produciría, además, disturbios en los servicios de radio ;
3.-que bajo ciertas condiciones podrá ser difícil mantener una vigilancia simultánea sobre más de una frecuencia de radio a bordo de las aeronavés ;;
4.-que es necesario economizar en el número de frecuencias que se emplean y en su uso.
Se recomienda:
a) que cada uno de los caminos para tráfico aéreo que puedan considerarse como constituyentes de una ruta aérea Interamericana, dentro del sentido que se dá a esta expresión en los Reglamentos Generales de El Cairo al definirla con motivo de la distribución de las radio-frecuencias , sea dividida en sectores de Control, siendo asignado cada sector a una estación que sirva tal ruta ;

1517

1518

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [55 STAT.
b) que , en principio , el límite de un sector de control es la mitad de la distancia que separa la estación a que tal Sector pueda estar asignado , de la estación que controle el sector siguiente en el mismo camino aéreo ;
c) que, para un vuelo dado , el punto exacto donde ha de transferirse el control de comunicaciones de una estación a la siguiente será determinado mediante un acuerdo entre las estaciones de tierra respectivas y la aeronave..
X
COMUNICACION-ES DEL SERVICIO AERONÁUTICO ENTRE PUNTOS FIJOS Considerando :
1.-Que el establecimiento de sectores de control podría requerir el empleo de un servicio fijo adecuado y rápido de comunicaciones entre las estaciones de control ;
2.-que podría suceder que las frecuencias asignadas a las rutas por el Reglamento General de Radiocomunicaciones no permitirán asegurar el volúmen necesario de tráfico entre puntos fijos , como asimismo, las comunicaciones esenciales de las aeronaves ;
3.-que el Reglamento General de Radiocomunicaciones no prohibe el empleo de frecuencias, a los servicios aeronáuticos , dentro de las bandas asignadas a los servicios fijos de comunicación entre puntos fijos.
Se recomienda:
a) que se establezca un servicio de radiocomunicación rápido y eficiente, entre estaciones de control de un mismo camino aéreo, ya sea entre estaciones adyacentes por una parte o entre estaciones terminales por la otra . Para este objeto , a lo menos dos series de frecuencias tendrán que proveerse según sean las distancias y para las operaciones diurnas y nocturnas ;
b) que las comunicaciones a larga distancia entre estaciones de control sean reducidas estrictamente al cambio de mensajes relacionados con la seguridad de aeronaves y la regularidad de los vuelos ;
c) que cada gobierno examine la posibilidad de proporcionar, para el uso de estaciones aeronáuticas de servicio fijo , frecuencias apropiadas dentro de las bandas asignadas a los servicios fijos, que puedan asegurar una rápida transmisión del tráfico necesario a las estaciones de control con las cuales se requiere una radiocomunicación directa. Las frecuencias que puedan encontrarse disponibles después de este exámen serán puestas a disposición de todos ; es de prever que la contribución de cada país para las frecuencias será en número proporcional a sus intereses en el servicio ;
d) que se realicen sobre la misma frecuencia transmisiones de radio emitidas por una estación aeronáutica fija, especialmente designada, y destinadas a ser recibidas por una o más estaciones semejantes , que cubran largas rutas transoceánicas, y situadas a distancias apropiadas a la propagación característica de las frecuencias empleadas en un momento dado ;

55 STAT. ] INTER-AMERICAN- RADIO COMMUNICATIONS-JAN. 26, 1940
e) que las frecuencias asignadas a rutas o las frecuencias elegidas para los servicios fijos aeronáuticos no serán empleadas para despachos meteorológicos que podrían ser difundidos más económicamente en radiodifusiones generales o por otros medios ;
f) que para los fines indicados , los países participantes en esta Conferencia preparen y procedan a intercambiar antes del 1 ° de Marzo de 1941 , todas las informaciones pertinentes que puedan ser de valor.
XI
ESTUDIOS DE LAS FRECUEN CIAS NECESARIAS PARA LOS SERVICIOS AERONÁUTICOS .
Considerando :
a) ue los servicios de aeronáutica nacionales o internacionales han demostrado un crecimiento regular y que sin lugar a duda, continuará su expansión rápidamente ;
b) que sería conveniente contar con datos suplementarios concernientes a las necesidades de la radio para los servicios aeronáuticos en el Hemisferio Occidental ;
Recomienda :
1.- que se lleve a efecto un estudio destinado a obtener en la fecha más próxima que sea practicable fijar, un número razonable de canales adicionales para los servicios de aeronáutica. Si estos canales adicionales fueran considerados necesarios .
2.-que con el fin antedicho , los países participantes en esta Conferencia preparen y canjeen antes del 1º de Marzo de 1941 todas las informaciones pertinentes que puedan ser de valor para formular proposiciones definitivas para la consideración en la próxima Conferencia Internacional de Telecomunicacion es.
XII
DIVISIÓN DE TIEMPO EN EL USO DE LAS FRECUENCIAS DE RUTA
Considerando :
Que las frecuencias de rutas intercontinentales están destinadas a ser empleadas conjuntamente por las aeronaves y las estaciones aeronáuticas de todos los países y que el Reglamento General de El Cairo no cubre , hasta ahora, todas las fases de los procedimientos de operaciónes de radio en los servicios aeronáuticos , como ser, por ejemplo , la división del tiempo de operación en el uso de las frecuencias de ruta; Se recomienda:
Que se haga un estudio con el objeto de determinar qué reglamentos adicionales de radio podrían ser dictados para los servicios internacionales de aeronáutica. Que cualquier reglamentación adicional de radio para los servicios aeronáuticos sea coordinada con las reglamentaciones existentes cubriendo los servicios móviles en general , tanto internacionales como individuales de cada país .

1519

1520

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [55 STAT.
XIII
FRECUENCIAS ESTABILIZADAS DE TRANSMISIÓN EN LAS DIVERSAS BANDAS
Considerando :
1.-Que las nuevas tolerancias fijadas por el Reglamento General de El Cairo probablemente harán necesario el empleo de aparatos automáticos para el control de frecuencia ;
2.-que el empleo posible de todas las frecuencias designadas en cada banda para cada línea intercontinental haría necesario proveer un gran número de frecuencias ;
Se recomienda:
a) que en el carácter de medida temporal , los transmisores de aeronaves deberán estar capacitados , si fuera necesario , para transmitir sobre dos frecuencias fijas en cada banda;
b) que se proceda a canjear informaciones sobre los métodos que se emplean para alcanzar la estabilidad necesaria.
XIV
EQUIPO DE RADIO PARA AERONAVES (GENERAL) .
Considerando :
Que el uso en conjunto de las frecuencias de las rutas intercontinentales trae nuevos problemas de diseño de equipo en vista de las tolerancias, necesariamente más rígidas , que se refieran a tales materias reglamentarias como estabilidad de frecuencia, cambios de banda , alteración rápida de frecuencias , etc. Se recomienda:
que se pida a los cuerpos consultivos competentes en aeronáutica y radio que preparen recomendaciones adecuadas , técnicas como de funcionamiento , sobre todas las materias en las cuales la standarización sería deseable y practicable, como ser:
a) Número mínimo de bandas de frecuencia que debiera ser cubierto por equipos radioeléctricos de aeronaves , y un estudio de las bandas específicas que debieran ser cubiertas.
b) Número mínimo de frecuencias estabilizadas que debieran proveerse .
c) Requerimientos para cambios de frecuencia y de bandas . d ) Normas de calibración para transmisores y receptores. e) Potencia transmisora mínima y sensibilidad del receptor.

a ) Requerir a los aficionados que operen en radiotelefonía en la banda de 14000 a 14400 Kc/s. un período previo de ensayo destinado a asegurar una experiencia mínima, a fin de garantizar el uso eficiente de esta banda.
b) Prohibir el empleo de estaciones de aficionados , ya sean fijas o móviles, para realizar servicio de radiodifusión , procurando que las mismas se circunscriban a su función específica, sin invadir la esfera de acción que corresponde a otros servicios de radiocomunicaciones.
c) Que las organizaciones de aficionados del Continente Americano se pongan de acuerdo entre sí por intermedio de las respectivas administraciones para establecer y proponer a la próxima Conferencia Interamericana un plan continental de subdivisión de las bandas para los diversos tipos de emisión .
ANEXO
(Ver artículo Nº 6.-)
ALGUNAS NORMAS TÉCNICAS RELACIONADAS CON LA SUPRESIÓN DE INTERFERENCIAS CAUSADAS POR APARATOS ELÉCTRICOS .
1.- Aparatos de diatermia, calentadores con campo de inducción, sistemas de llamada con onda portadora , y otros aparatos similares que empleen corriente de radiofrecuencia como algo esencial a su funcionamiento sin ser aparatos de radiocomunicación , pueden llegar a ser una fuente muy seria de interferencias a las radiocomunicaciones .
2. Tales aparatos tienen un lugar destacado en la terapéutica , la cirugía, las industrias , etc.

55 STAT. ] INTER-AMERICAN- RADIO COMMUNICATIONS-JAN. 26, 1940
3.- La irradiación de energía radiofrecuente no es esencial para el funcionamiento de los aparatos mencionados y puede ser impedida o controlada sin disminuir la utilidad de los mismos en cuanto a su finalidad .
4.- La irradiación tiene lugar generalmente en el circuito de alimentación , circuitos interiores o en los contactos con la fuente de energía eléctrica, todos los cuales constituyen elementos esenciales de estos aparatos .
5.- El alcance de la irradiación depende de la frecuencia o frecuencias. empleadas, de la potencia , diseño , instalación y manejo del aparato .
6.- La irradiación proveniente de los enchufes o contactos con las fuentes de energía eléctrica puede evitarse por medio de un transformador blindado o un filtro de línea . La irradiación de los circuitos internos puede ser evitada por medio de cajas metálicas apropiadas. La irradiación de los circuitos de alimentación puede ser reducida a un nivel tal que no ocasione perturbaciones a las radiocomunicaciones , por medio de un blindaje metálico adecuado , siempre que el blindaje encierre todo el aparato y sea de dimensiones suficientes para que no se produzcan fuertes corrientes de Foucault en el mismo . Se han empleado con éxito pantallas de papel de aluminio y pantallas de cobre bien unidas para blindar las habitaciones en las cuales funcionan aparatos de diatermia.
7.- Las frecuencias que se emplean para tales aparatos podrían ser cualquiera de las comprendidas en las bandas aprovechables del espectro radial . Sin embargo , muchos equipos de diatermia (precisamente aquellos que más perturbaciones radiales causan a larga distancia ) operan con frecuencias de aproximadamente 10000 a 25000 Kc/s . El empleo de frecuencias fuera de esta banda, causa a la recepción perturbaciones más bien de carácter local o a distancias moderadas .
8.- Los aparatos de diatermia comúnmente empleados son esencialmente transmisores de radio del tipo de oscilación auto-excitante y por lo general emplean energía anódica auto-rectificada. Siempre que no se haya incorporado un dispositivo automático de control de frecuencia y aún cuando el aparato funcione normalmente , la frecuencia de operación variará sobre bandas muy amplias debido a la inestabilidad inherente de los circuitos de oscilación , la gran variación de voltaje en el curso de un ciclo de alimentación de energía anódica, y la variación de cargas a que está sometido el circuito de alimentación .
9.- Todas las instalaciones de diatermia destinadas al mismo servicio pueden funcionar en la misma frecuencia sin disminuir su utilidad ya que su funcionamiento no es afectado por irradiaciones de otros aparatos . Es practicable operar sobre una frecuencia específica dentro de una tolerancia de frecuencia muy estrecha y sin encarecer mayormente el equipo . Queda entendido que en la actualidad la tendencia

1523

1524

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [ 55 STAT.
general en el diseño de los equipos de diatermia es la de emplear frecuencias superiores a 12 megaciclos aproximadamente y por lo tanto, se recomienda que los países contratantes consideren la conveniencia de requerir que todas las instalaciones de diatermia no empleen más de dos frecuencias , las cuales deben ser superiores a 12 megaciclos y estar en relación armónica , evitando de este modo perturbaciones en las frecuencias asignadas a las radiocomunicaciones. El empleo de dos frecuencias en relación armónica, proporciona una garantía aún mayor contra las interferencias a las radiocomunicaciones .
10. En la actualidad se, estima factible, aplicar normas basadas sobre buenos principios de ingeniería práctica y se recomienda a las administraciones la adopción de tales normas, a la brevedad posible.
Estas normas deben comprender las siguientes materias :
a) Frecuencias que deben emplearse, b) Control automático de frecuencia. c) Estabilidad de frecuencia. d) Tipo de emisión . e) Potencia máxima generada . f) Supresión efectiva de irradiaciones armónicas. g) Blindaje efectivo de los circuitos internos. h) Eliminación de la irradiación proveniente de las fuentes de
energía.
11.- En el caso de aparatos de diatermia que no cumplan con las normas que puedan ser adoptadas, los países contratantes deberán considerar la conveniencia de requerir que tales aparatos funcionen sólo en locales debidamente blindados .
12.- Los aparatos destinados a llamados interdomésticos , ciertos tipos de hornos de inducción y otros similares que empleen frecuencias medias o bajas, deberán estar sometidos al requerimiento de restringir la generación de armónicas y deberán ser sometidos a pruebas para comprobar que su irradiación no exceda cierto nivel prefijado. 13. Las administraciones interesadas intercambiarán todas las informaciones relacionadas con la solución del problema creado por las serias perturbaciones que afectan a los servicios de radiocomunicación .

Irradiações não essenciais.
Com o fim de evitar irradiações não essenciais , a escolha e manejo de aparelhos de emissão deverão inspirar -se nos mais recentes progressos da técnica, adoptando para tal fim os dictámens do Comité Consultivo Internacional de Radiocomunicações (C.C.I.R. )
As administrações participantes resolvem exigir das estações sob sua jurisdição que empreguem transmissores que estejam tão livres. quanto possível de toda emissão parasita .
Estas irradiações não deverão ser de uma intensidade tal que causem interferências nos equipamentos de recepção de desenho moderno que estejam ajustados fora da faixa de emissão requerida para o tipo da emissão empregada . No caso da emissão de tipo A-3 (radiotelefonia) o transmissor não deverá estar modulado além da sua capacidade de modulação , de maneira que possa dar lugar a irradiações interferentes parasitárias e no caso de amplitude de modulação , a percentagem de modulação operatória não deverá ser inferior a 75 % nos picos de frequênte repetição . Deverão adoptar-se meios mais adequados para assegurar que o transmissor não seja modulado en excesso da sua capacidade de modulação .
Uma irradiação não essencial é qualquer irradiação procedente de um transmissor que se ache fora da faixa de emissão normal para o tipo de transmissão empregada , incluindo qualquer produto armônico de modulação, golpes de manipulação , oscilações parasitas ou outros defeitos transmitórios .

Que a instituição de uma organização de segurança é essencial (que pode compreender a coordenação entre várias entidades , de natureza tanto governamentais como não governamentais), compreendendo serviços para a comunicação por rádio, direção por rádio, controle do tráfego e segurança na proteção de naves aéreas ;
2. que resultaria uma confusão se, a um mesmo tempo , uma multiplicidade de estações aeronáuticas de terra tomaram para sí a responsabilidade de comunicações referentes à segurança duma aeronave determinada, e que isto produziria , além disso, perturbações nos serviços de rádio ;
3. que, sob certas condições , poderá ser difícil manter uma vigilância simultánea sôbre mais duma frequência de rádio a bordo das aeronaves ;
4. que é necessário economizar no número de frequências que se empregam e no seu uso ;
Recomenda-se:
a) Que cada uma das vias para tráfego aéreo que possam considerar-se como constituintes duma rota aérea Interamericana, dentro do sentido que se dá a este termo nos Regulamentos Gerais do Cairo ao definí-lo com motivo da distribuição das rádiofrequências, seja dividida em setores de Controle, sendo atribuido cada setor a uma estação que sirva tal rota.
b) que, em princípio, o limite dum setor de controle é a metade da distância que separa a estação à que tal setor possa estar atribuido , da estação que controle o setor seguinte na mesma via aérea ;
c) que, para um determinado vôo , o ponto exato onde transferir- se-á o controle de comunicações duma estação à seguite , será determinado mediante um acordo entre as estações de terra respectivas e a aeronave.

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [55 STAT.
X
COMUNICAÇÕES DO SERVIÇO AERONÁUTICO ENTRE PONTOS FIXOS .
Considerando :
1. Que o estabelecimento de setores de controle poderia requerer o emprego dum serviço fixo adequado e rápido de comunicações entre as estações de controle ;
2. que poderia acontecer que as frequências atribuidas às rotas pelo Regulamento Geral de Radiocomunicações não permitirão assegurar o volume necessário de tráfego entre pontos fixos, como também, as comunicações essenciais das aeronaves ;
3. que o Regulamento Geral de Radiocomunicações não proibe o emprego de frequências, aos serviços aeronáuticos, dentro das faixas atribuidas aos serviços fixos de comunicação entre pontos fixos ;
Recomenda-se:
a) que se estabeleça um serviço de radiocomunicação rápido e eficiente , entre estações de controle duma misma via aérea, por uma parte , entre estações adjacentes , e por outra, entre estações terminais . Para tal objeto , pelo menos duas séries de frequências terão de se prover, segundo as distâncias , e para as operações diurnas e noturnas .
b) Que as comunicações a longa distância entre estações de controle sejan reduzidas estrictamente à permuta de mensagens relacionadas com a segurança de aeronaves e a regularidade dos Vôos ;
c) que cada govêrno examine a possibilidade de proporcionar, para o uso de estações aeronáuticas de serviço fixo, frequências apropriadas dentro das faixas atribuidas aos serviços fixos , que possam assegurar uma rápida transmissão do tráfego necessário às estações de controle com as quais se requer uma radiocomunicação direta. As frequências que possam encontrar-se disponíveis depois dêste exame, serão postas à disposição de todos ; é de se prever que a contribuição de cada país para as frequências será num número proporcional aos seus interêsses no serviço .
d) Que se realizem sôbre a mesma frequência transmissões de rádio emitidas por uma estação aeronáutica fixa, especialmente designada, e destinadas a serem recebidas por uma ou mais estações similares, que cobram longas rotas transoceánicas, e situadas a distâncias apropriadas à propagação caraterística das frequências empregadas num momento determinado ;
e) que as frequências atribuidas a rotas e as frequências escolhidas para os serviços fixos aeronáuticos não serão empregadas para despachos meteorológicos que poderiam ser difundidos mais econômicamente em radiodifusões gerais ou por outros meios ;

55 STAT. ] INTER-AMERICAN- RADIO COMMUNICATIONS-JAN. 26, 1940
XI
ESTUDOS DE FREQUÊNCIAS NECESSÁRIAS PARA OS SERVIÇOS AERONÁUTICOS
Considerando :
a) Que os serviços de aeronáutica nacionais ou internacionais têm demonstrado um acrescimo regular e que sem lugar a dúvida , a sua expansão continuará rápidamente ;
b) que sería conveniente contar com dados suplementários concernentes às necessidades da rádio para os serviços aeronáuticos no Hemisfério Occidental ;
Recomenda-se
1. Que se realize um estudo destinado a obter na data mais próxima que fôr possível fixar, um número razoável de canais adicionais para os serviços de aeronáutica . Si êstes canais forem considerados necessários .
2. que, com o fim acima aludido , os países participantes nêsta Conferência preparem e permutem antes do 1º de Março de . . . 1941 todas as informações pertinentes que possam ser de valor para formular proposições definitivas para a sua consideração na próxima Conferência Internacional de Telecomunicações .
XII
DIVISÃO DE TEMPO NO USO DAS FREQUÊNCIAS DE ROTA.
Considerando :
Que as frequências de rotas de rotas intercontinentais estão destinadas a serem empregadas conjuntamente pelas aeronaves e as estações aeronáuticas de todos os países e que o Regulamento Geral do Cairo não cobre, até hoje, todas as faces dos procedimentos de operações de rádio nos serviços aeronáuticos , como serem, por exemplo , a divisão do tempo de operação no uso das frequências de rota ; Recomenda-se : Que se faça um estudo com o fim de determinar quais dos regulamentos adicionais de rádio poderiam ser prescriptos para os serviços internacionais de aeronáutica. Que qualquer regulamentação adicional de rádio para os serviços aeronáuticos seja coordinada com as regulamentações existentes cobrindo os serviços móveis em geral , tanto internacionais como individuais de cada país.
XIII
FREQUÊNCIAS ESTABILIZADAS DE TRANSMISSÃO NAS DIVERSAS FAixas. Considerando :
1. Que as novas tolerâncias fixadas pelo Regulamento Geral do Cairo provávelmente farão necessário o emprego de aparelhos aeronáuticos para o controle de frequência ;
278941 °-42- FT. II- 42

1541

1542

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [55 STAT.
2. que o emprego de todas as frequencias atribuidas em cada faixa para cada linha intercontinental faría necessário prover um grande número de frequências ;
Recomenda-se:
a) Que no caráter de medida temporária, os transmissores de aeronaves deverão estar capacitados , se fôr necessário, para transmitir sobre as duas frequências fixas em cada faixa.
b) que se proceda a trocar informações sobre os métodos que se empregam para alcançar a estabilidade necessária .
XIV
EQUIPAMENTO DE RÁDIO PARA AERONAVES (GERAL)
Considerando: Que o uso em conjunto das frequências das rotas intercontinentais trazem novos problemas de desenho do equipamento em vista das tolerâncias , necessáriamente mais rígidas, que se referam a tais materias regulamentares como a estabilidade de frequência, mudança de faixas , alteração rápida de frequências , etc.
Recomenda-se:
de pedir aos corpos consultivos competentes em aeronáutica e rádio que preparem recomendações adequadas, técnicas como de funcionamente, sôbre todas as matérias nas quais a standardização seria desejável e praticável, como ser: a) número mínimo de faixas de frequências que deveria ser
coberto por equipamentos radioelétrricos de aeronaves, e um estudo das faixas especificas que deveriam ser cobertas . b) número mínimo ce frequências estabilizadas que deveriam prover- se . c) Requerimentos para mudanças de frequências e de faixas. d) Normas de calibração para transmissores e receptores. e) Potência transmissora mínima e sensibilidade do receptor.

ANEXO
(Vide o Artigo nº 6.)
ALGUMAS NORMAS TÉCNICAS RELACIONADAS COM A SUPRESSÃO DE INTERFERÊNCIAS CAUSADAS POR APARELHOS ELÉTRICOS .
1. Aparelhos de diatermia , aquecedores com campo de indução, sistemas de chamada com onda portadora, e outros aparelhos similares que utilizem corriente de radiofrequência como algo essencial para o seu funcionamento sem serem aparelhos de radiocomunicação , podem chegar a ser uma fonte muito séria de interferências às radiocomunicações .
2. Tais aparelhos ocupam um lugar destacado na terapéutica, a cirurgia, as indústrias, etc.
3. A irradiação de energia radiofrequênte não é essencial para o funcionamento dos aparelhos mencionados e pode ser evitada ou controlada sem diminuir a utilidade dos mesmos no tocante à sua finalidade .
4. A irradiação geralmente tem lugar no circuito de alimentação , circuitos interiores ou nos contatos com a fonte de energia elétrica, todos os quais constituem elementos essenciais dêstes aparelhos .
5. O alcance da irradiação depende da frequência ou frequências empregadas, da potência , do desenho , da instalação e do manejo do aparelho . 6. A irradiação proveniente das tomadas de corrente elétrica ou dos contatos com as fontes de energia elétrica pode se evitar por meio dum transformador blindado ou dum filtro de linha. A irradiação dos circuitos internos pode ser evitada por meio de caixas metálicas apropriadas. A irradiação dos circuitos de alimentação pode ser reduzida a uma proporção tal que não chegue a ocasionar perturbações , por meio duma blindagem metálica adequada, sempre que a blindagem encerre todo o aparelho e que seja de dimensões suficientes para que

55 STAT. ] INTER-AMERICAN-RADIO COMMUNICATIONS-JAN. 26, 1940
não se produçam fortes correntes de Foucault no mesmo. Têm-se empregado com éxito pantalhas de papel de aluminio e pantalhas de cobre bem unidas para blindar as habitações nas quais funcionam aparelhos de diatermia.
7. As frequências que se empregan para tais aparelhos poderiam ser qualquer das compreendidas nas faixas aproveitaveis do espectro radial . Não obstante, muitos equipamentos de diatermia (precisamente aquêles que mais perturbações radiais causam a longa distância) operam com frequências de aproximadamente 10000 a 25000 Kc/s. O emprego de frequências fora desta faixá, causa à recepção perturbações mais bem de caráter local ou a distâncias moderadas .
8. Os aparelhos de diatermia comummente empregados são essencialmente transmissores de rádio do tipo de oscilação auto-exitante e pelo geral empregam energia anódica auto-rectificada . Sempre que não se tenha incorporado um dispositivo automático de controle de frequência e ainda quando o aparelho funcione normalmente , a frequência de operação variaria sôbre faixas muito amplas devido à inestabilidade inherente aos circuitos de oscilação , a grande variação de voltagem no curso dum ciclo de alimentação de energia anódica, e a variação de cargas a que está submetido o circuito de alimentação .
9. Todas as instalações de diatermia destinadas ao mesmo serviço podem funcionar na mesma frequência sem diminuirem a sua utilidade já que seu funcionamento não é afectado por irradiações de outros aparelhos . É praticável operar sobre uma frequência específica dentro duma tolerância de frequência muito estreita e sem maior recargo do custo do equipamento . Fica entendido que na atualidade a tendência geral no desenho dos equipamentos de diatermia é a de empregar frequências superiores a 12 megaciclos aproximadamente e, em consequência, recomenda-se que os países contratantes considerem a conveniência de requerirem que todas as instalações de diatermia não empreguem mais de duas frequências, as quais devem ser superiores a 12 megaciclos e estar em relação armónica, evitando dêste modo perturbações nas frequências atribuidas às radiocomunicações . O emprego de duas frequências em relação armónica, proporciona uma garantia ainda mayor contra as interferencias às radiocomunicações.
10. Na atualidade, estima-se factível a aplicação de normas baseadas sôbre bons princípios de engenharia prática e recomenda-se às administrações a adopção de tais normas , à brevidade possível .
Estas normas devem compreender as seguintes matérias :
a) Frequências que devem empregar-se. b) Controle automático de frequência. c) Estabilidade de frequência. d) Tipo de emissão. e) Potência máxima gerada. f) Supressão efetiva de irradiações armónicas. g) Blindagem efetiva dos circuitos internos . h ) Eliminação da irradiação proveniente das fontes de energia .

1545

1546

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [55 STAT.
11. No caso de aparelhos de diatermia que não cumprirem com as normas que possam ser adoptadas, os países contratantes deverão considerar a conveniência de requerer que tais aparelhos funcionem unicamente em localidades devidamente blindadas.
12. Os aparelhos destinados a chamadas interdomésticas, certos tipos de fornos de inducção e outros similares que empreguem frequências meias ou baixas , deverão estar submetidos ao requerimento de restringirem a geração de armónicas e deverão ser submetidos a provas para comprovar que a sua irradiação não exceda certo nivel prefixado.
13. As administrações interessadas trocarão todas as informações relacionadas com a solucção do problema criado pelas sérias perturbações que afectam aos serviços de radiocomunicação.

ICELAND- DEFENSE-JULY 1, 1941

1547

Agreement between the United States of America and Iceland respecting the defense of Iceland by United States forces. Effected July 1, 1941; ratified by the Icelandic Regent in Council July 10, 1941 .

July 1, 1941 [E. A. S. 232]

Message sent by the Prime Minister of Iceland to the President of the United States, July 1 , 1941
In a conversation of June 24th, the British Minister explained that British forces in Iceland are required elsewhere. At the same time he stressed the immense importance of adequate defense of Iceland . He also called my attention to the declaration of the President of the United States to the effect that he must take all necessary measures to ensure the safety of the Western Hemisphere one of the President's measures is to assist in the defense of Iceland-and that the President is therefore prepared to send here immediately United States troops to supplement and eventually to replace the British force here. But that he does not consider that he can take this course except at the invitation of the Iceland Government.
After careful consideration of all the circumstances the Iceland Government , in view of the present state of affairs , admit that this measure is in accordance with the interest of Iceland , and therefore are ready to entrust the protection of Iceland to United States on the following conditions.
1. United States promise to withdraw all their military forces, land, air and sea, from Iceland immediately on conclusion of present war.
2. United States further promise to recognize the absolute independence and sovereignty of Iceland and to exercise their best efforts with those powers which will negotiate the peace treaty at the conclusion of the present war in order that such treaty shall likewise recognize the absolute independence and sovereignty of Iceland .
3. United States promise not to interfere with Government of Iceland neither while their armed forces remain in this country nor afterwards .
4. United States promise to organize the defense of the country in such a way as to ensure the greatest possible safety for the inhabitants themselves and assure that they suffer minimum disturbance from military activities ; these activities being carried out in consultation with Iceland authorities as far as possible . Also because of small population of Iceland and consequent danger to nation from presence of a numerous army , great care must be taken that only picked troops are sent here. Military authorities should be also instructed to keep in mind that Icelanders have been unarmed for centuries and are entirely unaccustomed to military discipline and conduct of troops towards the inhabitants of the country should be ordered accordingly.

1548

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [55 STAT.
5. United States undertake defense of the country without expense to Iceland and promise compensation for all damage occasioned to the inhabitants by their military activities.
6. United States promise to further interests of Iceland in every way in their power, including that of supplying the country with sufficient necessities , of securing necessary shipping to and from the country and of making in other respects favorable commercial and trade agreements with it .
7. Iceland Government expect that declaration made by President in this connection will be in agreement with these premises on the part of Iceland, and Government would much appreciate its being given the opportunity of being cognizant with wording of this declaration before it is published.
8. On the part of Iceland it is considered obvious that if United States undertake defense of the country it must be strong enough to meet every eventuality and particularly in the beginning it is expected that as far as possible efforts will be made to prevent any special danger in connection with change-over. Iceland Government lays special stress on there being sufficient airplanes for defensive purposes wherever they are required and they can be used as soon as decision is made for United States to undertake the defense of the country.
This decision is made on the part of Iceland as an absolutely free and sovereign state and it is considered as a matter of course that United States will from the beginning recognize this legal status of the country, both states immediately exchanging diplomatic representatives .

Message sent by the President of the United States July 1 , 1941 in response to a message from the Prime Minister of Iceland

I have received your message in which you have informed me that

after careful consideration of all the circumstances , the Iceland Gov-

ernment, in view of the present state of affairs, admits that the sending

to Iceland of United States troops to supplement and eventually to replace the present British forces there would be in accordance with the

interests of Iceland and that , therefore , the Iceland Government is

ready to entrust the protection of Iceland to the United States on the

following considerations:

Withdrawal on conclusion of war.

1. United States promise to withdraw all their military forces , land,

a matter of course that the United States will from the beginning

recognize the legal status of Iceland, both states immediately ex-

changing diplomatic representatives . I take pleasure in confirming to you hereby that the conditions set

It is the announced policy of the Government of the United States to undertake to join with the other nations of the Western Hemisphere in the defense of the New World against any attempt at aggression . In the opinion of this Government, it is imperative that the integrity

1550

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [55 STAT.
and independence of Iceland should be preserved because of the fact that any occupation of Iceland by a power whose only too clearly apparent plans for world conquest include the domination of the peoples of the New World would at once directly menace the security of the entire Western Hemisphere.
It is for that reason that in response to your message, the Government of the United States will send immediately troops to supplement and eventually to replace the British forces now there.
The steps so taken by the Government of the United States are taken in full recognition of the sovereignty and independence of Iceland and with the clear understanding that American military or naval forces sent to Iceland will in no wise interfere in the slightest degree with the internal and domestic affairs of the Icelandic people ; and with the further understanding that immediately upon the termination of the present international emergency, all such military and naval forces will be at once withdrawn leaving the people of Iceland and their Government in full sovereign control of their own territory.
The people of Iceland hold a proud position among the democracies of the world, with a historic tradition of freedom and of individual liberty which is more than a thousand years old . It is, therefore, all the more appropriate that in response to your message, the Government of the United States, while undertaking this defensive measure for the preservation of the independence and security of the democracies of the New World should at the same time be afforded the privilege of cooperating in this manner with your Government in the defense of the historic democracy of Iceland .
I am communicating this message, for their information, to the Governments of all of the other nations of the Western Hemisphere.

LEGATION OF THE

No. 474

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Ottawa, Canada, August 28, 1941 .

SIR :

With a view to securing greater uniformity of practice in the matter of the wearing of uniform by unarmed members of the United States Army and Navy when visiting Canada , and by unarmed members of the Canadian forces when visiting the United States , and to adopting on a reciprocal basis a more liberal regime than has prevailed hitherto, my Government suggests that the following procedure may be agreed upon:
Unarmed members of the military , naval and air forces of each country may travel in uniform to the other country and wear uniform while within the other country provided:

(1 ) that the privileges thus granted to military personnel shall not be construed as waiving or modifying in any way Immigration regulations of the other country, or permit the actual movement of troops by one country through the territory of the other, and (2) that military personnel of one country proceeding to the territory of the other shall have in their possession valid military papers, i . e . , "leave of absence" papers , soldier's "pass" , or a Navy "identification card" or Naval "leave ticket " if travelling for personal reasons ; or "official orders " if travelling on duty.

Proposed procedure.

This note and your reply, accepting my Government's proposals, will together constitute an arrangement that becomes effective the 7th day from the date of your reply. It is understood that the arrangement is terminable by either Government on notice , and that it will supersede the arrangement effected between the two Governments by the exchange of notes dated March 7 , April 5 and June 22 ,

His Majesty's Minister for Canada presents his compliments to the Secretary of State and has the honour to refer to the Arrangement arrived at between Canada and the United States regarding visits in uniform by members of defense forces , effected by exchange of notes dated March 7th, April 5th and June 22nd, 1939 .
The effect of the Arrangement which came into force on July 1st , 1939 , is that an individual uniformed member of the United States forces may enter Canada (and vice versa ) if he produces a written pass from his Commanding Officer, the pass to show the dates of the commencement and termination of the visit.
While there has been no correspondence on the subject , it is presumed that the United States Government would now consider that the Arrangement lapsed upon Canada's entry into the war. However, even if the Arrangement has lapsed , the Canadian Government

The United States Government considers that the arrangement is still in force and will be glad to continue to observe its terms so far as visits of the United States forces to Canada are concerned . However, in view of the changed situation the United States Government assumes that members of the armed forces of Canada will not come to the United States on any military mission, and it is hoped that so far as may be feasible members of the armed forces of Canada will not visit the United States in uniform .

SEÑOR SECRETARIO : Tengo el honor de hacer referencia a las recientes conversaciones
que he celebrado con Vuestra Excelencia acerca de la indemnización a los nacionales de los Estados Unidos de América que, con relación a la industria del petróleo en los Estados Unidos Mexicanos , fueron afectados por actos de expropiación o de otra manera , en sus propiedades , derechos o intereses , después del 17 de marzo de 1938 , por el Gobierno de México .

Sin embargo , las estipulaciones de esta nota no se aplican a las propiedades , derechos o intereses que hayan quedado comprendidos en un arreglo respecto a su compra, traspaso , o indemnización celebrado por sus propietarios o poseedores y el Gobierno de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos , y, por consiguiente, los peritos excluirán dichos derechos, intereses y propiedades de su labor de avalúo y de sus dictámenes .
2º. Los peritos designados celebrarán su primera reunión en la ciudad de México , dentro de los quince días siguientes a la fecha del último nombramiento hecho por los Gobiernos .

6º -Los peritos tendrán libre acceso a todos los archivos que se encuentren en poder del Gobierno de México , así como también a los campos petroleros , terrenos , instalaciones, oficinas y edificios y cualesquiera otras propiedades que directa o indirectamente se relacionen con la valuación . El perito de los Estados Unidos , a petición del perito mexicano , solicitará de las personas e instituciones interesadas las pruebas pertinentes ; cuando esa solicitud se refiera a las ya presentadas por tales personas o instituciones, su negativa para acceder a la solicitud hará aplicable la parte correspondiente del párrafo 9º.
7°. Tan pronto como un perito obtenga o conozca algún dato , informe, o elemento de prueba , pertinentes , lo dará a conocer al otro. Cada uno de ellos podrá solicitar del otro la exhibición de datos , informes o probanzas que , por cualquier circunstancia, sólo sean accesibles al solicitado .
8°. Dentro de un plazo de dos meses , contados desde la fecha de su primera reunión , los peritos deberán obtener y recibir todos los datos, informes y elementos probatorios ; sin embargo , gozarán de un término adicional de un mes , para la presentación por cualquier experto , de datos , informes y pruebas adicionales que complementen, aclaren o rectifiquen los elementos obtenidos o recibidos durante el aludido plazo de dos meses .

Los peritos no tendrán en cuenta razones de naturaleza técnica al formular sus resoluciones-ya sea la conjunta o las rendidas en desacuerdo sino que fijarán compensaciones adecuadas con fundamento en normas comunes de justicia y equidad , y se basarán en el valor de las propiedades , derechos o intereses, en el momento en que fueron afectados por actos del Gobierno de México y siempre que esas propiedades, derechos o intereses hayan sido adquiridos por nacionales de los Estados Unidos de América antes del 18 de marzo de 1938 .
10 °. Los peritos darán fin a sus labores dentro de los cinco meses siguientes a la fecha de esta nota. Si se pusieren de acuerdo sobre el monto de las compensaciones que correspondan a los nacionales de los Estados Unidos que hubieran sido afectados, rendirán a los dos Gobiernos un dictamen conjunto , fijando con precisión las indemnizaciones que acuerden . Los peritos deben formular recomendaciones sobre el modo y condiciones de pago de la compensación .
11 °. Los peritos fijarán un interés equitativo sobre las compensaciones indemnizatorias que encuentren procedentes ; ese interés se

12 °.-Ambos Gobiernos convienen en considerar inapelable el dictamen conjunto surgido del acuerdo de los peritos y, en consecuencia, como definitivas , las compensaciones e intereses que ese dictamen determine .

16° . Los dos Gobiernos convendrán la forma y términos de pago de las compensaciones que se determinen por alguno de los dos procedimientos anteriores como debidas a los afectados , nacionales de los Estados Unidos .

EXCELLENCY :

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of Your Excellency's note of today's date, reading as follows:

"I have the honor to refer to recent conversations I have had with Your Excellency with reference to compensating the nationals of the United States of America whose properties, rights

or interests in the petroleum industry in the United Mexican States were affected by acts of expropriation or otherwise by the Government of Mexico subsequent to March 17 , 1938.
It is my understanding that the following has been agreed upon:

1. Each of the Governments will appoint, within the thirty days following the date of this note, an expert whose duty it shall be to determine the just compensation to be paid the nationals of the United States of America whose properties , rights

with respect to their purchase, transfer or indemnification concluded between their owners or possessors and the Government of the United Mexican States and, in consequence, the experts

will exclude from their evaluation proceedings and reports said

6. The experts shall have free access to all records in the possession of the Mexican Government, as well as to the oil fields , lands , installations , offices , buildings and any other properties whatsoever involved directly or indirectly in the evaluation. The United States expert, on the request of the Mexican expert, will ask the interested persons and institutions for pertinent evidence ; when such request relates to evidence already submitted by such persons or institutions their refusal to comply with the request will bring into operation the applicable provision of paragraph 9 .
7. As soon as one expert obtains or learns of any pertinent data, report , or evidence , he will inform the other. Either expert may request from the other the furnishing of any data, report or evidence which for any reason are available only to the other.
8. Within a period of two months, from the date of their first meeting, the experts shall obtain and receive all data , reports , and evidence ; except that a further period of one month shall be allowed for the presentation by either expert of additional data, reports and evidence complementing, clarifying or rectifying the material obtained or received in the said period of two months .
9. The experts are required to examine and appraise all the proofs obtained directly or that may be submitted to them. They shall not take into account any specific evidence submitted ex parte when the person or institution submitting it refuses in connection with it to furnish pertinent complementary evidence requested by the United States expert , in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 6. The experts shall not take into account reasons of a technical nature in formulating their decisions- be these joint or those submitted in disagreement-but will fix adequate indemnities on the basis of common rules of justice and equity and will be guided by the value of the properties, rights or interests at the time they were affected by acts of the Government of Mexico provided that these properties, rights or interests had been acquired by nationals of the United States of America prior to March 18 , 1938 .
10. The experts shall complete their work within five months from the date of this note. If they are in accord regarding the amount of the compensation due to the affected United States nationals , they shall submit a joint report to the two Governments fixing exactly the indemnities upon which they agree . The experts shall formulate recommendations as to the manner and conditions
of payment of the compensation. 11. The experts shall fix equitable interest upon the indemnity
compensation they find due ; this interest will apply from the date fixed by these experts up to the time of payment.
12. Both Governments agree to consider unappealable the joint report resulting from the agreement of the experts, and , in consequence, as definitive, the compensation and interest fixed in such report.

ANNEX I. EXCHANGE OF Notes REGARDING UNITED STATES DESTROYERS AND NAVAL AND AIR
FACILITIES FOR THE UNITED STATES IN BRITISH TRANSATLANTIC TERRITORIES. No. 1 .
The Marquess of Lothian to Mr. Cordell Hull

SIR,

WASHINGTON, September 2, 1940.

I HAVE the honour, under instructions from His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, to inform you that in view of the friendly and sympathetic interest of His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom in the national security of the United States and their desire to strengthen the ability of the United States to co-operate effectively with the other nations of the

Americas in the defence of the Western Hemisphere, His Majesty's Government will secure the grant to the Government of the United States, freely and without consideration , of the lease for immediate establishment and use of Naval and Air bases and facilities for en-

trance thereto and the operation and protection thereof, on the Avalon Peninsula and on the Southern coast of Newfoundland, and on

the East coast and on the Great Bay of Bermuda. Furthermore, in view of the above and in view of the desire of
the United States to acquire additional Air and Naval bases in the Caribbean and in British Guiana, and without endeavouring to place a monetary or commercial value upon the many tangible and intangible rights and properties involved , His Majesty's Government will make available to the United States for immediate establishment and use Naval and Air bases and facilities for entrance thereto and the

operation and protection thereof, on the Eastern side of the Bahamas, the Southern coast of Jamaica, the Western coast of St. Lucia, the West coast of Trinidad in the Gulf of Paria, in the Island of Antigua, and in British Guiana within fifty miles of Georgetown , in exchange

for Naval and Military equipment and material which the United States Government will transfer to His Majesty's Government.
All of the bases and facilities referred to in the preceding para-

graphs will be leased to the United States for a period of ninety-nine years free from all rent and charges other than such compensation to be mutually agreed on to be paid by the United States in order to compensate the owners of private property for loss by expropriation or damage arising out of the establishment of the bases and facilities in question.

His Majesty's Government in the leases to be agreed upon will grant to the United States for the period of the leases all the rights, power and authority within the bases leased, and within the limits of the territorial waters and air spaces adjacent to or in the vicinity

55 STAT. ] GREAT BRITAIN, CANADA-NAVAL AND AIR BASES- MAR. 27, 1941

of such bases, necessary to provide access to and defence of such

bases and appropriate provisions for their control .

Without prejudice to the above-mentioned rights of the United

States authorities and their jurisdiction within the leased areas, the

adjustment and reconciliation between the jurisdiction of the authori-

ties of the United States within these areas and the jurisdiction of the

authorities of the territories in which these areas are situated shall be

determined by common agreement. The exact location and bounds of the aforesaid bases , the necessary

seaward, coast and anti-aircraft defences, the location of sufficient military garrisons, stores and other necessary auxiliary facilities shall be determined by common agreement.

His Majesty's Government are prepared to designate immediately

experts to meet with experts of the United States for these purposes.

Should these experts be unable to agree in any particular situation

except in the case of Newfoundland and Bermuda , the matter shall

be settled by the Secretary of State of the United States and His

Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.

I have, & c.

LOTHIAN .

DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES , KNOWN AS THE ATLANTIC CHARTER, BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND THE PRIME MINISTER OF THE UNITED KINGDOM, AUGUST 14, 1941
Joint declaration of the President of the United States of America and the Prime Minister, Mr. Churchill, representing His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom, being met together, deem it right to make known certain common principles in the national policies of their respective countries on which they base their hopes for a better future for the world.
First, their countries seek no aggrandizement , territorial or other ; Second, they desire to see no territorial changes that do not accord with the freely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned ; Third, they respect the right of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will live ; and they wish to see sovereign rights and self-government restored to those who have been forcibly deprived of them ; Fourth, they will endeavor, with due respect for their existing obligations , to further the enjoyment by all States, great or small , victor or vanquished, of access, on equal terms, to the trade and to the raw materials of the world which are needed for their economic prosperity ; Fifth, they desire to bring about the fullest collaboration between all nations in the economic field with the object of securing, for all , improved labor standards , economic advancement and social security ; Sixth, after the final destruction of the Nazi tyranny , they hope to see established a peace which will afford to all nations the means of dwelling in safety within their own boundaries , and which will afford assurance that all the men in all the lands may live out their lives in freedom from fear and want;
Seventh, such a peace should enable all men to traverse the high seas and oceans without hindrance ;
Eighth, they believe that all of the nations of the world , for realistic as well as spiritual reasons must come to the abandonment of the use of force. Since no future peace can be maintained if land , sea or air armaments continue to be employed by nations which threaten , or may threaten , aggression outside of their frontiers, they believe , pending the establishment of a wider and permanent system of general security, that the disarmament of such nations is essential . They will likewise aid and encourage all other practicable measures which will lighten for peace-loving peoples the crushing burden of armaments .

WHEREAS Public Resolution No. 82 , 75th Congress, approved
March 28 , 1938 (52 Stat. 148 ) , authorizes and requests the President to issue annually a proclamation setting apart the month of April of each year as Cancer Control Month, and to invite similar action on the part of the Governors of the several States, Territories , and possessions of the United States ; and
WHEREAS such Public Resolution requests that such proclamations invite the medical profession, the press, and all agencies and individuals interested in a national program for the control of the disease of cancer, by education and other cooperative means , to unite during the month of April in a public dedication to such a program and in a concerted effort to impress upon the people of the nation the necessity for such a program ; and

36 U. S. C. §150.

WHEREAS through the National Cancer Institute of the United

States Public Health Service, the Federal Government is leading the way in advancing research, in promoting effective treatment methods, and in advocating the provision of adequate facilities for cancer patients, as are the several States which have adopted programs for the control of cancer, as well as voluntary groups led by the Women's Field Army which are engaged in a nation-wide educational campaign ; and

WHEREAS last year cancer was responsible for the deaths of

approximately 152,000 Americans, many of whom were occupying key positions in industries and professions related to the national defense; and

WHEREAS great improvements in treatment facilities for cancer patients have been made during the past year, with cancer clinics approved by the American College of Surgeons now reaching the encouraging total of 345 ; and
WHEREAS it now remains for the individual citizen to shoulder

his responsibility by informing himself regarding cancer symptoms and the necessity for early diagnosis and treatment:
Designation ofApril NOW, THEREFORE, I , FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT, Presi- 1941 as Cancer Control dent of the United States of America, do hereby set apart the month Month.
of April, 1941 , as Cancer Control Month, and invite similar action on
the part of the Governors of the several States, Territories, and possessions of the United States ; and, in order that the American

people may become better informed concerning the prevalence of cancer and the effective steps which can be taken to control it, I commend to the medical profession, scientific groups, all organs of

opinion, including the press, radio, and motion picture industry, and educators, and civic leaders, the importance of conveying educational information to the American people and of impressing upon

them the necessity for eternal vigilance in this fight for humanity. Cancer control must be an important part of our unified effort to make America strong and keep her morale high. This fight can be won only when physicians, scientists, and public health officials are

effectively aided by a public opinion that is well informed regarding the few basic facts of cancer control.

NATIONAL EMPLOYMENT WEEK
BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
A PROCLAMATION
Despite great expansions in employment resulting directly and indirectly from our vast National Defense Program, the State and Federal governments continue to be concerned with the problems of older workers , many of whom still lack a place in industry. Among these are a considerable number of World War veterans, men who now average 48 years of age, and who , I feel, have a special appeal to our national sense of responsibility particularly during this time of national defense preparation .

[55 STAT.

The United States Employment Service a Nation-wide network of 1500 offices operated jointly by the State and Federal governments has made special efforts in behalf of workers past 40 years of age, including veterans. In the interest of utilizing all possible skills in our defense program, I urge that employers review carefully their standards of physical qualifications to assure that these valuable workers are not barred from employment . We know from available facts that men and women in middle life possess abilities and skills which fit them for employment in nearly every line of work and that they have a definite contribution to make at this time of increasing shortages of experienced workers. It is important in our national defense effort that we fully and effectively use the available manpower of the Nation .

A year ago I designated a National Employment Week during

which I asked that all our citizens give particular and active attention

to the problem of older workers who lack employment. The concerted efforts of government, many public-spirited groups, and par-

ticularly of employers throughout the land , resulted in the employment of thousands of workers past 40, among them many veterans.

I am grateful for the whole-hearted response to that appeal ; and as President, I desire to encourage a continued Nation-wide interest

I call upon all our loyal workmen as well as employers to merge their lesser differences in the larger effort to insure the survival of the only kind of government which recognizes the rights of labor or of capital.
I call upon loyal state and local leaders and officials to cooperate with the civilian defense agencies of the United States to assure our internal security against foreign directed subversion and to put every community in order for maximum productive effort and minimum of waste and unnecessary frictions.

NATIONAL SAFETY CAMPAIGN
BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
A PROCLAMATION
The Nation is confronted with a rapidly rising accident toll . At the present rate, the total number of deaths from accidents this year will exceed 100,000 . Traffic accidents alone caused 34,500 deaths in 1940, and thus far in the present year there has been an increase of seventeen per cent in traffic fatalities .
By taking a huge toll in life and property, accidents definitely hinder our national defense effort. To insure maximum efficiency we must have maximum safety twenty-four hours a day-not only at work, but also on the highway, at home, everywhere.
The troubled times in which we live must not make us callous or indifferent to human suffering. These unusual times require unusual safety efforts .
NOW , THEREFORE , I , FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT , President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon the officers and directors of the National Safety Council to mobilize its nation-wide resources in leading a concerted and intensified campaign against accidents , and do call upon every citizen , in public or private capacity, to enlist in this campaign and do his part in preventing wastage of human and material resources of the Nation through accidents .
IN WITNESS WHEREOF I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed .
DONE at the City of Washington this 18th day of August in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-one, and of

has enjoyed the immeasurable privileges which that charter guaranteed : the privileges of freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of the press , freedom of assembly and the free right to petition the government for redress of grievances.
It is especially fitting that this anniversary should be remembered and observed by those institutions of a democratic people which owe their very existence to the guarantees of the Bill of Rights : the free schools , the free churches, the labor unions, the religious and educational and civic organizations of all kinds which , without the guarantee of the Bill of Rights, could never have existed ; which sicken and disappear whenever, in any country, these rights are curtailed or withdrawn .

The 15th day of December, 1941 , is therefore set apart as a day of mobilization for freedom and for human rights, a day of remembrance of the democratic and peaceful action by which these rights were gained, a day of reassessment of their present meaning and their living worth.

Those who have long enjoyed such privileges as we enjoy forget in time that men have died to win them. They come in time to take these rights for granted and to assume their protection is assured.

We, however, who have seen these privileges lost in other continents and other countries can now appreciate their meaning to those people

1700

[55 STAT.

who enjoyed them once and now no longer can. We understand in some measure what their loss can mean . And by that realization we

have come to a clearer conception of their worth to us, and to a stronger and more unalterable determination that here in our land they shall not be lost or weakened or curtailed .
It is to give public expression and outward form to that understanding and that determination that we are about to commemorate the adoption of the Bill of Rights and rededicate its principles and its practice .
IN WITNESS WHEREOF , I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed .

DONE at the City of Washington this twenty-seventh day of November in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and
[SEAL] forty-one, and of the Independence of the United States

of America the one hundred and sixty-sixth .

RED CROSS WAR FUND CAMPAIGN

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

A PROCLAMATION

WHEREAS our country has been viciously attacked and forced

into a war of vast proportions , which will inevitably bring grief and

distress to many and self-sacrifice to all ; and

WHEREAS for more than sixty years the American National Red

Cross has played a vital role in binding up the wounds of the injured ,

in sheltering, feeding, and clothing the homeless , in succoring the

distressed , in rebuilding broken lives, and in rehabilitating the victims

of catastrophes of nature and of war; and

WHEREAS in preparation for just such an emergency as we are

now facing, the American National Red Cross has been spending

funds at the rate of more than one million dollars a month, which is

but a small fraction of the amount that the organization now requires

in order to carry out effectively its functions as an essential auxiliary

of our armed forces , particularly as a friendly liaison in welfare problems between the man in service and his family at home, and as a

key agency in the civil-defense plans:

Beginning of campaign.

NOW, THEREFORE, I , FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT, Presi-

dent of the United States of America, and President of the American

National Red Cross, do hereby proclaim the beginning, as of this date ,

of a Red Cross War Fund Campaign for the raising of a minimum

sum of fifty million dollars ; and I appeal to the American people to make this campaign an overwhelming success . Realizing the

desire of every American to participate in the national war effort, I

confidently anticipate an immediate and spontaneous response to this appeal.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed .

DAY OF PRAYER BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
A PROCLAMATION

The year 1941 has brought upon our nation a war of aggression by powers dominated by arrogant rulers whose selfish purpose is to de-
stroy free institutions. They would thereby take from the freedomloving peoples of the earth the hard-won liberties gained over many centuries .
The new year of 1942 calls for the courage and the resolution of old and young to help to win a world struggle in order that we may preserve all we hold dear.
