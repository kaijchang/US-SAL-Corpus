Such certification shall be under such regulations as may be prescribed from time to time by such certifying authority with the approval of the President. An application for a certificate must be filed at such time and in such manner as may be prescribed by such certifying authority under such regulations, but in no event shall such certificate have any effect unless an application therefor is filed before March 24, 1951, or before the expiration of 6 months after the beginning of such construction, reconstruction, erection, or installation or the date of such acquisition, whichever is later.
(2) After the completion or acquisition of any emergency facility with respect to which a certificate under paragraph (1) has been made, any expenditure (attributable to such facility and to the period after such completion or acquisition) which does not represent construction, reconstruction, erection, installation, or acquisition included in such certificate, but with respect to which a separate certificate is made under paragraph (1), shall not be applied in adjustment of the basis of such facility, but a separate basis shall be computed therefor pursuant to paragraph (1) as if it were a new and separate emergency facility.

(1) The amortization deduction for the month in which such amount is so includible shall (in lieu of the amount of the deduction for such month computed under subsection (a)) be equal to the amount so includible but not in excess of the adjusted basis of the emergency facility as of the end of such month (computed without regard to any amortization deduction for such month). Payments referred to in this subsection shall be payments the amounts of which are certified, under such regulations as the President may
§ 168(e)

CH. 1--NORMAL TAXES AND SURTAXES

prescribe, by the certifying authority designated by the President as compensation to the taxpayer for the unamortized cost of the emergency facihty made because--
(A) a contract with t h e United States involving the use of the facihty has been terminated by its terms or by cancellation, or
(B) the taxpayer had reasonable ground (either from provisions of a contract with the United States involving the use of the facility, or from written or oral representations made under authority of the United States) for anticipating future contracts involving the use of the facUity, which future contracts have not been made. (2) I n case the taxpayer is not entitled to any amortization deduction with respect to the emergency facility, the depreciation deduction allowable under section 167 on account of the month in which such amount is so includible shall be increased by such amount, b u t such deduction on account of such month shall not be in excess of the adjusted basis of the emergency facility as of the end of such month (computed without regard to a n y amount allowable, on account of such month, under section 167 or this paragraph). (h) L I F E TENANT AND REMAINDEEMAN.--In the case of property held by one person for life with remainder to another person, the deduction shall be computed as if the life tenant were the absolute owner of the property and shall be allowable to the life tenant,

(2) EMPLOYEES' ANNUITIES.--In the taxable year when paid, in an amount determined in accordance with paragraph (1), if the contributions are paid toward the purchase of retirement annuities and such purchase is a part of a plan which meets the requirements of section 401 (a) (3), (4), (5), and (6), and if refunds of premiums, if any, are applied within the current taxable year or next succeeding taxable year towards the purchase of such retirement annuities.
(3) STOCK BONUS AND PROFIT-SHARING TRUSTS.--
(A) LIMITS ON DEDUCTIBLE CONTRIBUTIONS.--In the taxable

140

INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1954

is exempt under section 501 (a), in an amount not in excess of 15 percent of the compensation otherwise paid or accrued during the taxable year to all employees under the stock bonus or profitsharing plan. If in any taxable year there is paid into the trust, or a similar trust then in effect, amounts less than the amounts deductible under the preceding sentence, the excess, or if no amount is paid, the amounts deductible, shall be carried forward and be deductible when paid in the succeeding taxable years in order of time, b u t the amount so deductible under this sentence in any such succeeding taxable year shall not exceed 15 percent of the compensation otherwise paid or accrued during such succeeding taxable year to the beneficiaries under the plan. In addition, any amount paid into the trust in any taxable year in excess of the amount allowable with respect to such year under the preceding provisions of this subparagraph shall be deductible in the succeeding taxable years in order of time, but the amount so deductible under this sentence in any one such succeeding taxable year together with the amount allowable under the first sentence of this subparagraph shall not exceed 15 percent of the compensation otherwise paid or accrued during such taxable year to the beneficiaries under the plan. The term "stock bonus or profit-sharing trust", as used in this subparagraph, shall not include any trust designed to provide benefits upon retirement and covering a period of years, if under the plan the amounts to be contributed by the employer can be determined actuarially as provided in paragraph (1). If the contributions are made to 2 or more stock bonus or profit-sharing trusts, such trusts shall be considered a single trust for purposes of applying the hmitations in this subparagraph.
(B) PROFIT-SHAKING PLAN OF AFFILIATED GROUP.--In the case of a profit-sharing plan, or a stock bonus plan in which contributions are determined with reference to profits, of a group of corporations which is an affiliated group within the meaning of section 1504, if any member of such affiliated group is prevented from making a contribution which it would otherwise have made under the plan, by reason of having no current or accumulated earnings or profits or because such earnings or profits are less than the contributions which it would otherwise have made, then so much of the contribution which such member was so prevented from making may be made, for the benefit of the employees of such member, by the other members of the group, to the extent of current or accumulated earnings or profits, except t h a t such contribution by each such other member shall be limited, where the group does not file a consolidated return, to that proportion of its total current and accumulated earnings or profits remaining after adjustment for its contribution deductible without regard to this subparagraph which the total prevented contribution bears to the total current and accumulated earnings or profits of all the members of the group remaining after adjustment for all contributions deductible without regard to this subparagraph. Contributions made under the preceding sentence shall be deductible under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph by the employer making such contribution, and, for the purpose of
§ 404(a) (3) (A)

CH. 1--NORMAL TAXES AND SURTAXES

141

determining amounts which may be carried forward and deducted under the second sentence of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph in succeeding taxable years, shall be deemed to have been made by the employer on behalf of whose employees such contributions were made.
(4) T R U S T S CREATED OR ORGANIZED OUTSIDE THE UNITED
STATES.--If a stock bonus, pension, or profit-sharing trust would qualify for exemption under section 501 (a) except for the fact that it is a trust created or organized outside the United States, contributions to such a trust by an employer which is a resident, or corporation, or other entity of the United States, shall be deductible under the preceding paragraphs.
(5) OTHER PLANS.--In the taxable year when paid, if the plan is not one included in paragraph (1), (2), or (3), if the employees' rights to or derived from such employer's contribution or such compensation are nonforfeitable at the time the contribution or compensation is paid.
(6) TAXPAYERS ON ACCRUAL BASIS.--For purposes of paragraphs (1), (2), and (3), a taxpayer on the accrual basis shall be deemed to have made a payment on the last day of the year of accrual if the payment is on account of such taxable year and is made not later than the time prescribed by law for filing the return for such taxable year (including extensions thereof).
(7) LIMIT OF DEDUCTION.--If amounts are deductible under paragraphs (1) and (3), or (2) and (3), or (1), (2), and (3), in connection with 2 or more trusts, or one or more trusts and an annuity plan, the total amount deductible in a taxable year under such trusts and plans shall not exceed 25 percent of the compensation otherwise paid or accrued during the taxable year to the persons who are the beneficiaries of the trusts or plans. In addition, any amount paid into such trust or under such annuity plans in any taxable year in excess of the amount allowable with respect to such year under the preceding provisions of this paragraph shall be deductible in the succeeding taxable years in order of time, but the amount so deductible under this sentence in any one such succeeding taxable year together with the amount allowable under the first sentence of this paragraph shall not exceed 30 percent of the compensation otherwise paid or accrued during such taxable years to the beneficiaries under the trusts or plans. This paragraph shall not have the effect of reducing the amount otherwise deductible under paragraphs (1), (2), and (3), if no employee is a beneficiary under more than one trust, or a trust and an annuity plan.
(b) M E T H O D OF GONTRIBUTIONS, ETC., HAVING THE EFFECT OF A
PLAN.^--If there is no plan but a method of employer contributions or compensation has the effect of a stock bonus, pension, profit-sharing, or annuity plan, or similar plan deferring the receipt of compensation, subsection (a) shall apply as if there were such a plan.
(c) CERTAIN NEGOTIATED PLANS.--If contributions are paid by an employer--
(1) under a plan under which such contributions are held in trust for the purpose of paying (either from principal or income or both) for the benefit of employees and their families and dependents

(2) such plan was established prior to January 1, 1954, as a result of an agreement between employee representatives and the Government of the United States during a period of Government operation, under seizure powers, of a major part of the productive facilities of the industry in which such employer is engaged, such contributions shall not be deductible under this section nor be made nondeductible by this section, but the deductibility thereof shall be governed solely by section 162 (relating to trade or business expenses). This subsection shall have no application with respect to amounts contributed to a trust on or after any date on which such trust is qualified for exemption from tax under section 501 (a). (d) CARRYOVER OF UNUSED DEDUCTIONS.--The amount of any unused deductions or contributions in excess of the deductible amounts for taxable years to which this part does not apply which under section 23 (p) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 would be allowable as deductions in later years had such section 23 (p) remained in effect, shall be allowable as deductions in taxable years to which this part applies as if such section 23 (p) were continued in effect for such years. However, the deduction under the preceding sentence shall not exceed an amount which, when added to the deduction allowable under subsection (a) for contributions made in taxable years to which this part applies, is not greater than the amount which would be deductible under subsection (a) if the contributions which give rise to the deduction under the preceding sentence were made in a taxable year to which this part applies.

subsequent to the death of the employee by the estate of the

decedent, or by a person who acquired the right to exercise such

the taxable estate of the deceased employee of the net value for

estate tax purposes of the restricted stock option. For this pur-

pose, the deduction shall be determined under section 691 (c) as

if the option acquired from the deceased employee were an item

of gross income in respect of the decedent under section 691 and

146

INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1954

(A) such modification, extension, or renewal shall be considered as the granting of a new option,
(B) the fair market value of such stock at the time of the granting of such option shall be considered as--
(i) the fair market value of such stock on the date of the original granting of the option,
(ii) the fair market value of such stock on the date of the making of such modification, extension, or renewal, or
(iii) the fair market value of such stock at the time of the making of any intervening modification, extension, or renewal, whichever is the highest. Subparagraph (B) shall not apply if the aggregate of the monthly average fair market values of the stock subject to the option for the 12 consecutive calendar months before the date of the modification, extension, or renewal, divided by 12, is an amount less than 80 percent of the fair market value of such stock on the date of the original granting of the option or the date of the making of any intervening modification, extension, or renewal, whichever is the highest.
(2) DEFINITION OF MODIFICATION.--The term "modification" means any change in the terms of the option which gives the employee additional benefits under the option, but such term shall not include a change in the terms of the option--
(A) attributable to the issuance or assumption of an option under subsection (g); or
(B) to permit the option to qualify under subsection (d) (1) (B). If an option is exercisable after the expiration of 10 years from the date such option is granted, subparagraph (B) shall not apply unless the terms of the option are also changed to make it not exercisable after the expiration of such period.
(f) E F F E C T OF DISQUALIFYING DISPOSITION.--If a share of stock, acquired by an individual pursuant to his exercise of a restricted stock option, is disposed of by him within 2 years from the date of the granting of the option or within 6 months after the transfer of such share to him, then any increase in the income of such individual or deduction from the income of his employer corporation for the taxable year in which such exercise occurred attributable to such disposition, shall be treated as an increase in income or a deduction from income in the taxable year of such individual or of such employer corporation in which such disposition occurred.

CH. 1--NORMAL TAXES AND SURTAXES

HT

the excess of the aggregate fair market value of all shares subject to the option immediately before such substitution or assumption over the aggregate option price of such shares, and

SEC. 453. INSTALLMENT METHOD.
(a) DEALERS IN PERSONAL PROPERTY.--Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary or his delegate, a person who regularly sells or otherwise disposes of personal property on the installment plan may return as income therefrom in any taxable year that proportion of the installment payments actually received in that year which the gross profit, realized or to be realized when payment is completed, bears to the total contract price.
(b) SALES OF REALTY AND CASUAL SALES OF PERSONALTY.--
(1) GENERAL RULE.--Income from-- (A) a sale or other disposition of real property, or (B) a casual sale or other casual disposition of personal prop-
erty (other than property of a kind which would properly be included in the inventory of the taxpayer if on hand at the close of the taxable year) for a price exceeding $1,000, may (under regulations prescribed by the Secretary or his delegate) be returned on the basis and in the manner prescribed in subsection (a).

(2) ADJUSTMENT IN TAX FOR AMOUNTS PREVIOUSLY TAXED.--
In determining the adjustment referred to in paragraph (1) (B), first determine, for each taxable year before the year of change, the amount which equals the lesser of--

(B) the portion of the tax for the adjustment year which is attributable to the gross profit described in subparagraph (A).

If any such election is made with respect to any such obligation, it shall apply also to all such obligations owned by the taxpayer at the beginning of the first taxable year to which it applies and to all such obligations thereafter acquired by him and shall be binding for all subsequent taxable years, unless on application by the taxpayer the Secretary or his delegate permits him, subject to such conditions as the Secretary or his delegate deems necessary, to change to a different method.

(1) ALLOWANCE OF DEDUCTION.--
(A) GENERAL RULE.--A person who includes an amount in gross income under subsection (a) shall be allowed, for the same taxable year, as a deduction an amount which bears the same ratio to the estate tax attributable to the net value for estate tax purposes of all the items described in subsection (a) (1) as the value for estate tax purposes of the items of gross income or portions thereof in respect of which such person included the amount in gross income (or the amount included in gross income, whichever is lower) bears to the value for estate tax purposes of all the items described in subsection (a) (1).
(B) ESTATES AND TRUSTS.--In the case of an estate or trust, the amount allowed as a deduction under subparagraph (A) shall be computed by excluding from the gross income of the estate or trust the portion (if any) of the items described in subsection (a) (1) which is properly paid, credited, or to be distributed to the beneficiaries during the taxable year.

revenue law.

(c) RELATED TAXPAYER.--For purposes of this part, the term

SEC. 1314. AMOUNT AND METHOD OF ADJUSTMENT.

(a) ASCERTAINMENT OF AMOUNT OF ADJUSTMENT.--In computing
the amount of an adjustment under this part there shall first be ascertained the tax previously determined for the taxable year with respect to which the error was made. The amount of the tax previously determined shall be the excess of--
(1) the sum of-- (A) the amount shown as the tax by the taxpayer on his
return (determined as provided in section 6211 (b) (1) and (3), relating to the definition of deficiency), if a return was made by the taxpayer and an amount was shown as the tax by the taxpayer thereon, plus
(B) the amounts previously assessed (or collected without assessment) as a deficiency, over--
(2) the amount of rebates, as defined in section 6211 (b) (2), made. There shall then be ascertained the increase or decrease in tax previously determined which results solely from the correct treatment of the item which was the subject of the error (with due regard given to the effect of the item in the computation of gross income, taxable income, and other matters under this subtitle). A similar computation shall be made for any other taxable year affected, or treated as aff'ected, by a net operating loss deduction (as defined in section 172) or by a capital loss carryover (as defined in section 1212), determined with reference to the taxable year with respect to which the error was made. The amount so ascertained (together with any amounts wrongfully collected as additions to the tax or interest, as a result of such error) for each taxable year shall be the amount of the adjustment for that taxable year.

(b) METHOD OF ADJUSTMENT.--The adjustment authorized in section 1311 (a) shall be made by assessing and collecting, or refunding or crediting, the amount thereof in the same manner as if it were a

§ 1313(a)(4)

-

deficiency determined by the Secretary or his delegate with respect to the taxpayer as to whom the error was made or an overpayment claimed by such taxpayer, as the case may be, for the taxable year or years with respect to which an amount is ascertained under subsection (a), and as if on the date of the determination one year remained before the expiration of the periods of limitation upon assessment or filing claim for refund for such taxable year or years. If, as a result of a determination described in section 1313 (a) (4), an adjustment has been made b y the assessment and collection of a deficiency or the refund or credit of an overpayment, and subsequently such determination is altered or revoked, the amount of the adjustment ascertained under subsection (a) of this section shall be redetermined on the basis of such alteration or revocation and any overpayment or deficiency resulting from such redetermination shall be refunded or credited, or assessed and collected, as the case may be, as an adjustment under this part. I n the case of an adjustment resulting from an increase or decrease in a net operating loss which is carried back to the year of adjustment, interest shall not be collected or paid for any period prior to the close of the taxable year in which the net operating loss arises.
(c) ADJUSTMENT UNAFFECTED BY OTHER ITEMS.--The amount to
be assessed and collected in the same manner as a deficiency, or to be refunded or credited in the same manner as an overpayment, under this part, shall not be diminished by any credit or set-off based upon any item other than the one which was the subject of the adjustment. Other than in the case of an adjustment resulting from a determination under section 1313 (a) (4), the amount of the adjustment under this part, if paid, shall not be recovered by a claim or suit for refund or suit for erroneous refund based upon any item other than the one which was the subject of the adjustment.
(d) PERIODS FOR WHICH ADJUSTMENTS MAY B E MADE.--No adjust-
ment shall be made under this part in respect of any taxable year beginning prior to January 1, 1932.
(e) T A X E S IMPOSED BY SUBTITLE C.--This part shall not apply to any tax imposed by subtitle C (sec. 3101 and following relating to employment taxes).

SEC. 1321. INVOLUNTARY LIQUIDATION X)F LIFO INVENTORIES.
(a) ADJUSTMENT OF TAXABLE INCOME AND RESULTING TAX.--If,
for any taxable year ending after June 30, 1950, and before January -1, 1955, the closing inventory of a taxpayer inventorying goods under the method provided in section 22 (d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 reflects a decrease from the opening inventory of such goods for such year, and if the taxpayer elects, at such time and in such manner and subject to such regulations as the Secretary or his delegate may prescribe, to have this section apply, and if it is established to the satisfaction of the Secretary or his delegate, in accordance with such regulations, that such decrease is attributable to the involuntary liquidation of such inventory as defined in section 22 (d) (6) (B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 (as modified by subsection (b) of this section), and if the closing inventory of a subsequent taxable year, ending before January 1, 1956, reflects a replacement, in whole or in part, of the goods so previously liquidated, then the taxable income of the taxpayer otherwise determined for the year of such involuntary liquidation shall be increased by an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the aggregate cost of such goods reflected in the opening inventory of the year of involuntary liquidation over the aggregate replacement cost, or decreased by an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the aggregate replacement cost of such goods over the aggregate cost thereof reflected in the opening inventory of the year of the involuntary liquidation. The taxes imposed by this chapter (and by chapters 1 and 2 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939) for the year of such liquidation, for preceding taxable years, and for all taxable years intervening between the year of liquidation and the year of replacement shall be redetermined, giving effect to such adjustments. Any increase in such taxes resulting from such adjustments shall be assessed and collected as a deficiency but without interest, and any overpayment so resulting shall be credited or refunded to the taxpayer without interest.
(b) DEFINITIONS.--For purposes of this section, the term "involuntary liquidation" shall have the meaning given to it in section 22 (d) (6) (B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 and, in addition, it shall mean a failure, as referred to in that section, on the part of the taxpayer due, directly and exclusively, to disruption of normal trade relations between countries. For purposes of this section, the words "enemy" and "war", as used in such section 22 (d) (6) (B), shall be interpreted, pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Secretary or his delegate, in such a way as to apply to circumstances, occurrences and conditions, lacking a state of war, which are similar, by reason of a state of national preparedness, to those which would exist under a state of war.

this section as though they specifically referred to this section. If, for a n y taxable year ending after June 30, 1950, and before January 1, 1953, subparagraph (C) of such section 22 (d) (6) applies with respect to involuntary liquidations of goods of the same class subject to both subparagraph (A) of such section and to this section, the involuntary liquidations of such goods subject to this section shall be considered for the purpose of such subparagraph (C) as having occurred before the involuntary liquidations of such goods subject to subparagraph (A) of such section 22 (d) (6). For the purpose of this subsection, and with respect to the taxable years covered by this section, the reference in subparagraph (E) of such section 22 (d) (6) to section 734 (d) shall be taken as a reference to section 452 (d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, and, with respect to any taxable year to which any provision of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 may not be applicable, references in such subparagraph to such provision shall, where applicable, be deemed a reference to the corresponding provision of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.

§ 1332(b)(1)

344

INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1954

(2) PORTION TREATED AS ORDINARY INCOME.--To the extent t h a t such amount plus the aggregate of the amounts of previous such recoveries exceed that part of the aggregate of such deductions, which did not result in a reduction of any tax of the taxpayer under such chapters and do n o t exceed t h a t part of the aggregate of such deductions which did result in a reduction of any tax of the taxpayer under such chapters, such amount shall be included in gross income but shall not be deemed a gain on the involuntary conversion of property as a result of its destruction or seizure.

To the extent that such amount plus the aggregate of the amounts of previous such recoveries exceed the aggregate of the allowable deductions in prior taxable years on account of the destruction or seizure of property described in such section 127 (a), such amount shall be considered a gain on the involuntary conversion of property as a result of its destruction or seizure and shall be recognized or not recognized as provided in section 1033 (relating to involuntary conversions).

For purposes of this section, in the case of the recovery of the same property or interest considered under such section 127 (a) as destroyed or seized, the fair market value of such property or interest shall, at the option of the taxpayer, be considered an amount equal to the adjusted basis (for determining loss) of such property or interest in the hands of the taxpayer on the date such property or interest was considered under such section 127 (a) as destroyed or seized. The amount of the recovery determined under this paragraph shall be reduced for pur-

§ 1332(b)(2)

\

poses of paragraphs (2) and (3) by the amount of the obligations or liabilities with respect to the property considered under such section 127 (a) as destroyed or seized in respect of which the recovery was received, if the taxpayer for any previous taxable year chose under section 127 (b) (2) of such code to treat such obligations or liabilities as discharged or satisfied out of such property, and such obligations or liabilities were not so discharged or satisfied before the date of the recovery.
(2) ADJUSTMENT FOR PRIOR TAX BENEFITS.--That p a r t of the amount of the recovery, in respect of any property considered under such section 127 (a) as destroyed or seized, which is not in excess of the allowable deductions in prior taxable years on account of such destruction or seizure of the property (the amount of such allowable deductions being first reduced by the aggregate amount of any prior recoveries in respect of the same property) shall be excluded from gross income for the taxable year of the recovery for purposes of computing the tax under this subtitle; but there shall be added to, and assessed and collected as a part of, the tax under this subtitle for the taxable year of the recovery the total increase in the tax under chapters 1 and 2 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 for all taxable years which would result by decreasing, in an amount equal to such part of the recovery so excluded, such deductions allowable in the prior taxable years with respect to the destruction or seizure of the property.

Such regulations shall give effect to previous recoveries of any kind (including recoveries described in section 111, relating to recovery of bad debts, etc.) with respect to any prior year, and shall provide for the case where there was no tax for the prior year, but shall otherwise treat the tax previously determined for any year in accordance with the principles set forth in section 1314 (a) (relating to corrections of errors). All credits allowable against the tax for any year and all carryovers and carrybacks affected by so decreasing the allowable deductions shall be taken into account in computing the increase in the tax, except that the computation of the excess profits credit under chapter 2 E of such code for any taxable year shall not be affected.
(3) G A I N ON RECOVERY.--The amount of any recovery or part thereof, in respect of property considered under such section 127 (a) as destroyed or seized, which is not excluded from gross income under paragraph (2), shall be considered for the taxable year of the recovery as gain on the involuntary conversion of property as a result of its destruction or seizure and shall be recognized or not recognized as provided in section 1033.

In applying section 1333, such restoration shall be treated as the recovery of the same interest considered under such section 127 (a) as destroyed or seized.
SEC. 1335. ELECTION BY TAXPAYER FOR APPLICATION OF SECTION 1333.
If the taxpayer elects to have section 1333 apply to any taxable year in which he recovered any money or property in respect of property considered under section 127 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, as destroyed or seized, section 1333 shall apply to all taxable years of the taxpayer beginning after December 31, 1941, and such election, once made, shall be irrevocable. The election shall be made in such manner and at such time as the Secretary or his delegate may by regulations prescribe, except that no election under this section may be made unless the taxpayer recovers money or property (in respect of property considered under such section 127 (a) as destroyed or seized) during the taxable year for which the election is made.

(1) the period of limitations provided in chapter 66 on the making of assessments and the beginning of distraint or a proceeding in court for collection shall not, with respect to--
(A) the amount to be added to the tax for such taxable year under section 1333, and
(B) any deficiency for such taxable year or for any other taxable year, to the extent attributable to the basis of the recovered property being determined under section 1336 (b),
expire before the expiration of 2 years following the date of the making of such election, and such amount and such deficiency may be assessed at any time before the expiration of such period notwithstanding any law or rule of law which would otherwise prevent such assessment and collection, and
(2) in case refund or credit of any overpayment resulting from the application of section 1333 to such taxable year is prevented on the date of the making of such election, or within one year from such date, by the operation of any law or rule of law (other than section 7122, relating to compromises), refund or credit of such overpayment may, nevertheless, be made or allowed if claim therefor is filed within one year from such date. In the case of any taxable year ending before the date of the making by the taxpayer of an election under this section, no interest shall be paid on any overpayment resulting from the application of section 1333 to such taxable year, and no interest shall be assessed or collected with respect to any amount or any deficiency specified in

If any corporation transfers, on or after January 1, 1951, all or part of its property (other than money) to another corporation which was created for the purpose of acquiring such property or which was not actively engaged in business at the time of such acquisition, and if after such transfer the transferor corporation or its stockholders, or both, are in control of such transferee corporation during any part of the taxable year of such transferee corporation, then such transferee corporation shall not for such taxable year (except as may be otherwise determined under section 269 (b)) be allowed either the $25,000 exemption from surtax provided in section 11 (c) or the $60,000 accumulated earnings credit provided in paragraph (2) or (3) of section 535 (c), unless such transferee corporation shall establish by the clear preponderance of the evidence that the securing of such exemption or credit was not a major purpose of such transfer.

SEC. 2012. CREDIT FOR GIFT TAX.
(a) I N GENERAL.--If a tax on a gift has been paid under chapter 12 (sec. 2501 and following), or under corresponding provisions of prior laws, and thereafter on the death of the donor any amount in respect of such gift is required to be included in the value of the gross estate of the decedent for purposes of this chapter, then there shall be credited against the tax imposed by section 2001 the amount of the tax paid on a gift under chapter 12, or under corresponding provisions of prior laws, with respect to so much of the property which constituted the gift as is included in the gross estate, except that the amount of such credit shall not exceed an amount which bears the same ratio to the tax imposed by section 2001 (after deducting from such tax the credit

§ 2012(a)

376

INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1954

for State death taxes provided by section 2011) as the value (at the time of the gift or at the time of the death, whichever is lower) of so much of the property which constituted the gift as is included in the gross estate bears to the value of the entire gross estate reduced by the aggregate amount of the charitable and marital deductions allowed under sections 2055, 2056, and 2106 (a) (2).
(b) In applying, with respect to any gift, the ratio stated in subsection (a), the value at the time of the gift or at the time of the death, referred to in such ratio, shall be reduced--
(1) by such amount as will properly reflect the amount of such gift which was excluded in determining (for purposes of section 2503 (a)), or of corresponding provisions of prior laws, the total amount of gifts made during the year in which the gift was made;

(3) if a deduction with respect to such gift is allowed under sections 2055 or 2106 (a) (2) (relating to charitable deduction)--then by the amount of such value, reduced as provided in paragraph (1) of this subsection.
(c) Where the decedent was the donor of the gift but, under the provisions of section 2513, or corresponding provisions of prior laws, the gift was considered as made one-half by his spouse--
(1) the term "the amount of the tax paid on a gift under chapter 12", as used in subsection (a), includes the amounts paid with respect to each half of such gift, the amount paid with respect to each being computed in the manner provided in subsection (d); and
(2) in applying, with respect to such gift, the ratio stated in subsection (a), the value a t the time of the gift or a t the time of the death, referred to in such ratio, includes such value with respect to each half of such gift, each such value being reduced as provided in paragraph (1) of subsection (b).
(d) (1) For purposes of subsection (a), the amount of tax paid on a gift under chapter 12, or under corresponding provisions of prior laws, with respect to any gift shall be an amount which bears the same ratio to the total tax paid for the year in which the gift was made as the amount of such gift bears to the total amount of taxable gifts (computed without deduction of the specific exemption) for such year.
(2) For purposes of paragraph (1), the "amount of such gift" shall be the amount included with respect to such gift in determining (for the purposes of section 2503 (a), or of corresponding provisions of prior laws) the total amount of gifts made during such year, reduced by the amount of any deduction allowed with respect to such gift under section 2522, or under corresponding provisions of prior laws (relating to charitable deduction), or under section 2523 (relating to marital deduction).

(a) GENERAL RULE.--The tax imposed by section 2001 shall be credited with all or a part of the amount of the Federal estate tax paid with respect to the transfer of property (including property passing as a result of the exercise or non-exercise of a power of appointment) to the decedent by or from a person (herein designated as a "transferor") who died within 10 years before, or within 2 years after, the decedent's death. If the transferor died within 2 years of the death of the decedent, the credit shall be the amount determined under subsections (b) and (c). If the transferor predeceased the decedent by more than 2 years, the credit shall be the following percentage of the amount so determined--
(1) 80 percent, if within the third or fourth years preceding the decedent's death;
(2) 60 percent, if within the fifth or sixth years preceding the decedent's death;
(3) 40 percent, if within the seventh or eighth years preceding the decedent's death; and
(4) 20 percent, if within the ninth or tenth years preceding the decedent's death. (b) COMPUTATION OF CREDIT.--Subject to the limitation prescribed in subsection (c), the credit provided by this section shall be an amount which bears the same ratio to the estate tax paid (adjusted as indicated hereinafter) with respect to the estate of the transferor as the value of the property transferred bears to the taxable estate of the transferor (determined for purposes of the estate tax) decreased by any death taxes paid with respect to such estate and increased by the exemptiou provided for by section 2052 or section 2106 (a) (3), or the corresponding provisions of prior laws, in determining the taxable estate of the transferor for purposes of the estate tax. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the estate tax paid shall be the Federal estate tax paid increased by any credits allowed against such estate tax under section 2012, or corresponding provisions of prior laws, on account of gift tax, and for any credits allowed against such estate tax under this section on account of prior transfers where the transferor acquired property from a person who died within 10 years before the death of the decedent.
(c) LIMITATION ON C R E D I T . --
(1) I N GENERAL.--The credit provided in this section shall not exceed the amount by which--
(A) the estate tax imposed by section 2001 or section 2101 (after deducting the credits for State death taxes, gift tax, and foreign death taxes provided for in sections 2011, 2012, and 2014) computed without regard to this section, exceeds
(B) such tax computed by excluding from the decedent's gross estate the value of such property transferred and, if applicable, by making the adjustment hereinafter indicated. If any deduction is otherwise allowable under section 2055 or section 2106 (a) (2) (relating to charitable deduction) then, for the purpose of the computation indicated in subparagraph (B), the amount of such deduction shall be reduced by that part of such deduction which the value of such property transferred bears to the decedent's entire gross estate reduced by the deductions allowed under sections

(2) Two OR MORE TRANSFERORS.--If the Credit provided in this section relates to property received from 2 or more transferors, the limitation provided in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be computed by aggregating the value of the property so transferred to the decedent. The aggregate limitation so determined shall be apportioned in accordance with the value of the property transferred to the decedent by each transferor.
(d) VALUATION OF PROPERTY TRANSFERRED.--The value of property transferred to the decedent shall be the value used for the purpose of determining the Federal estate tax liability of the estate of the transferor but--
(1) there shall be taken into account the effect of the tax imposed by section 2001 or 2101, or any estate, succession, legacy, or inheritance tax, on the net value to the decedent of such property;
(2) where such property is encumbered in any manner, or where the decedent incurs any obligation imposed by the transferor with respect to such property, such encumbrance or obligation shall be taken into account in the same manner as if the amount of a gift to the decedent of such property was being determined; and
(3) if the decedent was the spouse of the transferor at the time of the transferor's death, the net value of the property transferred to the decedent shall be reduced by the amount allowed under section 2056 (relating to marital deductions), or the corresponding provision of prior law, as a deduction from the gross estate of the transferor. (e) PROPERTY D E F I N E D . -- F o r purposes of this section, the term "property" includes any beneficial interest in property, including a general power of appointment (as defined in section 2041).

If the decedent at the time of his death was not a citizen of the United States, credit shall not be allowed under this section unless the foreign country of which such decedent was a citizen or subject, in imposing such taxes, allows a similar credit in the case of a citizen of the United States resident in such country. The determination of the country within which property is situated shall be made in accordance with the rules applicable under subchapter B (sec. 2101 and following) in determining whether property is situated within or without the United States.
(b) LIMITATIONS ON CREDIT.--The credit provided in this section with respect to such taxes paid to any foreign country--

(2) shall not, with respect to all such taxes, exceed an amount which bears the same ratio to the tax imposed by section 2001 (after deducting from such tax the credits provided by sections 2011 and 2012) as the value of property which is--
(A) situated within such foreign country, (B) subjected to the taxes of such foreign country, and (C) included in the gross estate bears to the value of the entire gross estate reduced by the aggregate amount of the deductions allowed under sections 2055 and 2056.
(c) VALUATION OF PROPERTY,--
(1) The values referred to in the ratio stated in subsection (b) (1) are the values determined for purposes of the tax imposed by such foreign country.
(2) The values referred to in the ratio stated in subsection (b) (2) are the values determined under this chapter; but, in applying such ratio, the value of any property described in subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) thereof shall be reduced by such amount as will properly reflect, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary or his delegate, the deductions allowed in respect of such property under sections 2055 and 2056 (relating to charitable and marital deductions). (d) PROOF OF CREDIT.--The credit provided in this section shall be allowed only if the taxpayer establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary or his delegate --
(1) the amount of taxes actually paid to the foreign country, (2) the amount and date of each payment thereof, (3) the description and value of the property in respect of which such taxes are imposed, and (4) all other information necessary for the verification and computation of the credit.

(2) If, under section 6161, an extension of time has been granted for payment of the tax shown on the return, or of a deficiency, then within such 4-year period or before the date of the expiration of the period of the extension. Refund based on such credit may (despite the provisions of sections
6511 and 6512) be made if claim therefor is filed within the period
above provided. Any such refund shall be made without interest.

SEC. 2032. ALTERNATE VALUATION.
(a) GENERAL.--The value of the gross estate may be determined, if the executor so elects, by valuing all the property included in the gross estate as follows:

(2) In the case of property not distributed, sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of, within 1 year after the decedent's death such property shall be valued as of the date 1 year after the decedent's death.
(3) Any interest or estate which is affected by mere lapse of time shall be included at its value as of the time of death (instead of the later date) with adjustment for any difference in its value as of the later date not due to mere lapse of time. (b) SPECIAL R U L E S . -- N o deduction under this chapter of any item shall be allowed if allowance for such item is in effect given b y ' t h e alternate valuation provided by this section. Wherever in any other subsection or section of this chapter reference is made to the value of property at the time of the decedent's death, such reference shall be deemed to refer to the value of such property used in determining the value of the gross estate. In case of an election made by the executor under this section, then--
(1) for purposes of the charitable deduction under section 2055 or 2106 (a) (2), any bequest, legacy, devise, or transfer enumerated therein, and
(2) for the purpose of the marital deduction under section 2056, any interest in property passing to the surviving spouse, shall be valued as of the date of the decedent's death with adjustment for any difference in value (not due to mere lapse of time or the occurrence or nonoccurrence of a contingency) of the property as of the date 1 year after the decedent's death (substituting, in the case of property distributed by the executor or trustee, or sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of, during such 1-year period, the date thereof).

The value of the gross estate shall include the value of all property (except real property situated outside of the United States) to the extent of any interest therein of the surviving spouse, existing at the time of the decedent's death as dower or curtesy, or by virtue of a statute creating an estate in lieu of dower or curtesy.

United States) to the extent of any interest therein of which the decedent has at any time made a transfer (except in case of a bona fide sale for an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth), by trust or otherwise, in contemplation of his death.
(b) APPLICATION OF GENERAL RULE.--If the decedent within a period of 3 years ending with the date of his death (except in case of a bona fide sale for an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth) transferred an interest in property, relinquished a power, or exercised or released a general power of appointment, such transfer, relinquishment, exercise, or release shall, unless shown to the contrary, be deemed to have been made in contemplation of death within the meaning of this section and sections 2038 and 2041 (relating to revocable transfers and powers of appointment); but no such transfer, relinquishment, exercise, or release made before such 3-year period shall be treated as having been made in contemplation of death.
SEC. 2036. TRANSFERS WITH RETAINED LIFE ESTATE.
(a) GENERAL R U L E . -- T h e value of the gross estate shall include the value of all property (except real property situated outside of the United States) to the extent of any interest therein of which the decedent has at any time made a transfer (except in case of a bona fide sale for an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth), by trust or otherwise, under which he has retained for his life or for any period not ascertainable without reference to his death or for any period which does not in fact end before his death--
(1) the possession or enjoyment of, or the right to the income from, the property, or
(2) the right, either alone or in conjunction with any person, to designate the persons who shall possess or enjoy the property or the income therefrom.
(b) LIMITATION ON APPLICATION or GENERAL RULE.--This section
shall not apply to a transfer made before March 4, 1931; nor to a transfer made after March 3, 1931, and before June 7, 1932, unless the property transferred would have been includible in the decedent's gross estate by reason of the amendatory language of the joint resolution of March 3, 1931 (46 Stat. 1516).

(1) possession or enjoyment of the property can, through ownership of such interest, be obtained only by surviving the decedent, and
(2) the decedent has retained a reversionary interest in the property (but in the case of a transfer made before October 8, 1949, only if such reversionary interest arose by the express terms of the instrument of transfer), and the value of such reversionary interest immediately before the death of the decedent exceeds 5 percent of the value of such property.

(b) SPECIAL R U L E S . -- F o r purposes of this section, the term "reversionary interest" includes a possibiUty that property transferred by the decedent--
(1) may return to him or his estate, or (2) may be subject to a power of disposition by him, but such term does not include a possibility that the income alone from such property may return to him or become subject to a power of disposition by him. The value of a reversionary interest immediately before the death of the decedent shall be determined (without regard to the fact of the decedent's death) by usual methods of valuation, including the use of tables of mortality and actuarial principles, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary or his delegate. In determining the value of a possibility that property may be subject to a power of disposition by the decedent, such possibility shall be valued as if it were a possibility that such property may return to the decedent or his estate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an interest so transferred shall not be included in the decedent's gross estate under this section if possession or enjoyment of the property could have been obtained by any beneficiary during the decedent's life through the exercise of a general power of appointment (as defined in section 2041) which in fact was exercisable immediately before the decedent's death. SEC. 2038. REVOCABLE TRANSFERS.
(a) I N GENERAL.--The value of the gross estate shall include the value of all property (except real property situated outside of the United States)--
(1) TRANSFERS AFTER JUNE 22, 1936.--To the extent of any interest therein of which the decedent has at any time made a transfer (except in case of a bona fide sale for an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth), by trust or otherwise, where the enjoyment thereof was subject at the date of his death to any change through the exercise of a power (in whatever capacity exercisable) by the decedent alone or by the decedent in conjunction with any other person (without regard to when or from what source the decedent acquired such power), to alter, amend, revoke, or terminate, or where any such power is relinquished in contemplation of decedent's death.
(2) TRANSFERS ON OR BEFORE JUNE 22, 1936.--To the extent of any interest therein of which the decedent has at any time made a transfer (except in case of a bona fide sale for an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth), by trust or otherwise, where the enjoyment thereof was subject at the date of his death to any change through the exercise of a power, either by the decedent alone or in conjunction with any person, to alter, amend, or revoke, or where the decedent relinquished any such power in contemplation of his death. Except in the case of transfers made after June 22, 1936, no interest of the decedent of which he has made a transfer shall be included in the gross estate under paragraph (1) unless it is includible under this paragraph. (b) D A T E OF EXISTENCE OF P O W E R . -- F o r purposes of this section, the power to alter, amend, revoke, or terminate shall be considered to exist on the date of the decedent's death even though the exercise of the power is subject to a precedent giving of notice or even though
§ 2038(b)

384

INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1954

the alteration, amendment, revocation, or termination takes effect only on the expiration of a stated period after the exercise of the power, whether or not on or before the date of the decedent's death notice has been given or the power has been exercised. In such cases proper adjustment shall be made representing the interests which would have been excluded from the power if the decedent had lived, and for such purpose, if the notice has not been given or the power has not been exercised on or before the date of his death, such notice shall be considered to have been given, or the power exercised, on the date of his death.
SEC. 2039. ANNUITIES.
(a) GENERAL.--The gross estate shall include the value of an annuity or other payment receivable by any beneficiary by reason of surviving the decedent under any form of contract or agreement entered into after March 3, 1931 (other than as insurance under policies on the life of the decedent), if, under such contract or agreement, an annuity or other payment was payable to the decedent, or the decedent possessed the right to receive such annuity or payment, either alone or in conjunction with another for his life or for any period not ascertainable without reference to his death or for any period which does not in fact end before his death.
(b) AMOUNT INCLUDIBLE.--Subsection (a) shall apply to only such part of the value of the annuity or other payment receivable under such contract or agreement as is proportionate to that part of the purchase price therefor contributed by the decedent. For purposes of this section, any contribution by the decedent's employer or former employer to the purchase price of such contract or agreement (whether or not to an employee's trust or fund forming part of a pension, annuity, retirement, bonus or profit sharing plan) shall be considered to be contributed by the decedent if made by reason of his employment.
(c) EXEMPTION OF ANNUITIES UNDER CERTAIN TRUSTS AND
PLANS.--Notwithstanding the provisions of this section or of any provision of law, there shall be excluded from the gross estate the value of an annuity or other payment receivable by any beneficiary (other than the executor) under--
(1) an employees' trust (or under a contract purchased by an employees' trust) forming part of a pension, stock bonus, or profitsharing plan which, at the time of the decedent's separation from employment (whether by death or otherwise), or at the time of termination of the plan if earlier, met the requirements of section 401 (a); or
(2) a retirement annuity contract purchased by an employer (and not by an employees' trust) pursuant to a plan which, at the time of decedent's separation from employment (by death or otherwise), or at the time of termination of the plan if earlier, met the requirements of section 401 (a) (3). If such amounts payable after the death of the decedent under a plan described in paragraph (1) or (2) are attributable to any extent to payments or contributions made by the decedent, no exclusion shall be allowed for that part of the value of such amounts in the proportion that the total payments or contributions made by the decedent bears to the total payments or contributions made.

SEC. 2041. POWERS OF APPOINTMENT.

(a) I N GENERAL,--The value of the gross estate shall include the

value of all property (except real property situated outside of the

United States)--

(1) POWERS OF APPOINTMENT CREATED ON OR BEFORE OCTOBER

21, 1942.--To the extent of any property with respect to which a

general power of appointment created on or before October 21,

. 1942, is exercised by the decedent--

(A) by will, or

(B) by a disposition which is of such nature that if it were a

·= transfer of property owned by the decedent, such property

would be includible in the decedent's gross estate under sections

2035 to 2038, inclusive;

but the failure to exercise such a power or the complete release of

such a power shall not be deemed an exercise thereof. If a general

power of appointment created on or before October 21, 1942, has

been partially released so that it is no longer a general power of

, appointment, the exercise of such power shall not be deemed to be

the exercise of a general power of appointment if--

,

(i) such partial release occurred before November 1, 1951, or

j|, ,,

(ii) the donee of such power was under a legal disability to

release such power on October 21, 1942, and such partial

§ 2041(a)(1)

386

INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1954

release occurred not later than 6 months after the termination of such legal disability. (2) POWERS CREATED AFTER OCTOBER 21, 1942,--To the extent of any property with respect to which the decedent has at the time of his death a general power of appointment created after October 21, 1942, or with respect to which the decedent has at any time exercised or released such a power of appointment by a disposition which is of such nature that if it were a transfer of property owned by the decedent, such property would be includible in the decedent's gross estate under sections 2035 to 2038, inclusive. A disclaimer or renunciation of such a power of appointment shall not be deemed a release of such power. For purposes of this paragraph (2), the power of appointment shall be considered to exist on the date of the decedent's death even though the exercise of the power is subject to a precedent giving of notice or even though the exercise of the power takes effect only on the expiration of a stated period after its exercise, whether or not on or before the date of the decedent's death notice has been given or the power has been exercised.
(3) CREATION OF ANOTHER POWER IN CERTAIN CASES.--^To the
extent of any property with respect to which the decedent-- (A) by will, or (B) by a disposition which is of such nature that if it were a
transfer of property owned by the decedent such property would be includible in the decedent's gross estate under section 2035, 2036, or 2037, exercises a power of appointment created after October 21, 1942, by creating another power of appointment which under the applicable local law can be validly exercised so as to postpone the vesting of any estate or interest in such property, or suspend the absolute ownership or power of alienation of such property, for a period ascertainable without regard to the date of the creation of the first power, (b) DEFINITIONS.--For purposes of subsection (a)--
(1) GENERAL POWER OF APPOINTMENT.--The term "general power of appointment" means a power which is exercisable in favor of the decedent, his estate, his creditors, or the creditors of his estate; except that--
(A) A power to consume, invade, or appropriate property for the benefit of the decedent which is limited by an ascertainable standard relating to the health, education, support, or maintenance of the decedent shall not be deemed a general power of appointment.

iv

(ii) If the power is not exercisable by the decedent except in

conjunction with a person having a substantial interest in the

property, subject to the power, which is adverse to exercise of

the power in favor of the decedent--such power shall not be

deemed a general power of appointment. For the purposes of

this clause a person who, after the death of the decedent, may

be possessed of a power of appointment (with respect to

the property subject to the decedent's power) which he may

exercise in his own favor shall be deemed as having an interest in

'(

the property and such interest shall be deemed adverse to such

exercise of the decedent's power.

j

(iii) If (after the application of clauses (i) and (ii)) the

i

power is a general power of appointment and is exercisable

in favor of such other person--such power shall be deemed a

general power of appointment only in respect of a fractional

part of the property subject to such power, such part to be

determined by dividing the value of such property by the

·

number of such persons (including the decedent) in favor of

whom such power is exercisable.

For purposes of clauses (ii) and (iii), a power shall be deemed

' to be exercisable in favor of a person if it is exercisable in favor

of such person, his estate, his creditors, or the creditors of his

estate.

(2) L A P S E OF POWER.--The lapse of a power of appointment

created after October 21, 1942, during the life of the individual

possessing the power shall be considered a release of such power.

The preceding sentence shall apply with respect to the lapse of

powers during any calendar year only to the extent that the prop-

erty, which could have been appointed b y exercise of such lapsed

powers, exceeded in value, at the time of such lapse, the greater of

the following amounts:

(A) $5,000, or

(B) 5 percent of the aggregate value, at the time of such lapse,

of the assets out of which, or the proceeds of which, the exercise

of the lapsed powers could have been satisfied.

(3) D A T E OF CREATION OF POWER.--For purposes of this section,

a power of appointment created by a will executed on or before

October 21, 1942, shall be considered a power created on or before

such date if the person executing such will dies before July 1, 1949,

388

INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1954

express terms of the policy or other instrument or by operation of law) only if the value of such reversionary interest exceeded 5 percent of the value of the policy immediately before the death of the decedent. As used in this paragraph, the term "reversionary interest" includes a possibility that the policy, or the proceeds of the policy, may return to the decedent or his estate, or may be subject to a power of disposition by him. The value of a reversionary interest at any time shall be determined (without regard to the fact of the decedent's death) by usual methods of valuation, including the use of tables of mortality and actuarial principles, pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Secretary or his delegate. In determining the value of a possibility that the policy or proceeds thereof may be subject to a power of disposition by the decedent, such possibility shall be valued as if it were a possibility that such policy or proceeds may return to the decedent or his estate.
SEC. 2043. TRANSFERS FOR INSUFFICIENT CONSIDERATION.
(a) I N GENERAL.--If any one of the transfers, trusts, interests, rights, or powers enumerated and described in sections 2035 to 2038, inclusive, and section 2041 is made, created, exercised, or relinquished for a consideration in money or money's worth, but is not a bona fide sale for an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth, there shall be included in the gross estate only the excess of the fair market value at the time of death of t h e property otherwise to be included on account of such transaction, over the value of the consideration received therefor by the decedent.

(B) where such interest or property is encumbered in any manner, or where the surviving spouse incurs any obligation imposed by the decedent with respect to the passing of such interest, such encumbrance or obligation shall be taken into account in the same manner as if the amount of a gift to such spouse of such interest were being determined.

(B) SPECIAL RULE IN CASES INVOLVING COMMUNITY PROP-

ERTY.--If the decedent and his surviving spouse at any time, held

property as community property under the law of any State, Ter-

of the gross estate the sum of--

(i) the value of property which is at the time of the death

of the decedent held as such community property; and

(ii) the value of property transferred by the decedent during

his life, if at the time of such transfer the property was held as

and (iii) of this subparagraph, bears to the entire value of the

gross estate.

merely one-half thereof) would be or would have been includible

in determining the value of his gross estate without regard to

one transaction or a series of transactions, into separate prop-

tion shall not apply to such property except as to the value thereof

If a general power of appointment created on or before October 21, 1942, has been partially released so that it is no longer a general power of appointment, the subsequent exercise of such power shall not be deemed to be the exercise of a general power of appointment if--
(1) such partial release occurred before November 1, 1951, or (2) the donee of such power was under a legal disability to release '" such power on October 21, 1942, and such partial release occurred ' not later than six months after the termination of such legal disability.
' (b) POWERS CREATED AFTER OCTOBER 21, 1942.--The exercise or
release of a general power of appointment created after October 21, 1942, shall be deemed a transfer of property by the individual possessing such power. A disclaimer or renunciation of such a power of appointment shall n o t be deemed a release of such power.
(c) DEFINITION OF GENERAL POWER OF APPOINTMENT.--For purposes of this section, the term "general power of appointment" means a power which is exercisable in favor of the individual possessing the power (hereafter in this subsection referred to as the "possessor"), his estate, his creditors, or the creditors of his estate; except that--

§ 2514(c)(1)

408

INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1954

(2) A power of appointment created on or before October 21, 1942, which is exercisable by the possessor only in conjunction with another person shall not be deemed a general power of appointment.
(3) In the case of a power of appointment created after October 21, 1942, which is exercisable by the possessor only in conjunction with another person--
(A) if the power is not exercisable by the possessor except in conjunction with the creator of the power--such power shall not be deemed a general power of appointment;
(B) if the power is not exercisable by the possessor except in conjunction with a person having a substantial interest, in the property subject to the power, which is adverse to exercise of the power in favor of the possessor--such power shall not be deemed a general power of appointment.

(d) CREATION OF ANOTHER POWER IN CERTAIN CASES.--If a power of appointment created after October 21, 1942, is exercised by creating another power of appointment which, under the applicable local law, can be validly exercised so as to postpone the vesting of any estate or interest in the property which was subject to the first power, or suspend the absolute ownership or power of alienation of such property, for a period ascertainable without regard to the date of the creation of the first power, such exercise of the first power shall, to the extent of the property subject to the second power, be deemed a transfer of property by the individual possessing such power. (e) LAPSE OF POWER.--The lapse of a power of appointment created after October 21, 1942, during the life of the individual possessing the power shall be considered a release of such power. The rule of the preceding sentence shall apply with respect to the lapse of powers during any calendar year only to the extent that the property which could have been appointed by exercise of such lapsed powers exceeds in value the greater of the following amounts:

§ 2514(c)(1)

(b) TERMINATION.--In the case of the termination of a tenancy by the entirety, other than by reason of the death of a spouse, the creation of which, or additions to which, were not deemed to be transfers by reason of subsection (a), a spouse shall be deemed to have made a gift to the extent that the proportion of the total consideration furnished by such spouse multiplied by the proceeds of such termination (whether in form of cash, property, or interests in property) exceeds the value of such proceeds of termination received by such spouse.
(c) EXERCISE OF ELECTION.--The election provided by subsection (a) shall be exercised by including such creation of a tenancy by the entirety or additions made to the value thereof as a transfer by gift, to the extent such transfer constitutes a gift, determined without regard to this section, in the gift tax return of the donor for the calendar year in which such tenancy by the entirety was created or additions made to the value thereof; filed within the time prescribed by law, irrespective of whether or not the gift exceeds the exclusion provided by section 2503 (b).

SEC. 2523. GIFT TO SPOUSE.

.

' '

(a) I N GENERAL.--Where a donor who is a citizen or resident trans-

fers during the calendar year by gift an interest in property to a donee

who a t the time of the gift is the donor's spouse, there shall be allowed

as a deduction in computing taxable gifts for the calendar year an

amount with respect to such interest equal to one-half of its value.

(b) L I F E ESTATE OR OTHER TERMINABLE INTEREST.--Wliere, on

the lapse of time, on the occurrence of an event or contingency, or

on the failure of an event or contingency to occur, such interest

transferred to the spouse will terminate or fail, no deduction shall be

allowed with respect to such interest--

(1) if the donor retains in himself, or transfers or has transferred

(for less than an adequate and full consideration in money or

money's worth) to any person other than such donee spouse (or

the estate of such spouse), an interest in such property, and if by

. reason of such retention or transfer the donor (or his heirs or

assigns) or such person (or his heirs or assigns) may possess or

enjoy any part of such property after such termination or failure

of the interest transferred to the donee spouse; or

(2) if the donor immediately after the transfer to the donee

spouse has a power to appoint an interest in such property which

he can exercise (either alone or in conjunction with any person) in

such manner that the appointee m a y possess or enjoy any part of

such property after such termination or failure of the interest

transferred to the donee spouse. For purposes of this paragraph,

the donor shall be considered as having immediately after the trans-

fer to the donee spouse such power to appoint even though such

; power cannot be exercised until after the lapse of time, upon the

' occurrence of an event or contingency, or on the failure of an event

or contingency to occur.

An exercise or release at any time by the donor, either alone or in

conjunction with any person, of a power to appoint an interest in

property, even though not otherwise a transfer, shall, for purposes

of paragraph (1), be considered as a transfer by him. Except as pro-

vided in subsection (e), where a t the time of the transfer it is impos-

sible to ascertain the particular person or persons who may receive

from the donor an interest in property so transferred by him, such

interest shall, for purposes of paragraph (1), be considered as trans-

ferred to a person other than the donee spouse.

(c) INTEREST IN UNIDENTIFIED ASSETS.--Where the assets o u t of

which, or the proceeds of which, the interest transferred to the donee

spouse may be satisfied include a particular asset or assets with respect

to which no deduction would be allowed if such asset or assets were

transferred from the donor to such spouse, then the value of the interest

transferred to such spouse shall, for purposes of subsection (a), be

reduced by the aggregate value of such particular assets.

(d) JOINT INTERESTS.--If the interest is transferred to the donee

spouse as sole joint tenant with the donor or as tenant by the entirety,

the interest of the donor in the property which exists solely by reason

of the possibility that the donor may survive the donee spouse, or

that there may occur a severance of the tenancy, shall not be con-

§ 2523 ,

CH. 12--GIFT TAX

413

sidered for purposes of subsection (b) as an interest retained by the donor in himself.
(e) L I F E ESTATE W I T H P O W E R OF APPOINTMENT IN D O N E E
SPOUSE.---Where the donor transfers an interest in property, if by such transfer his spouse is entitled for life to all of the income from the entire interest, or all the income from a specific portion thereof, payable annually or at more frequent intervals, with power in the donee spouse to appoint the entire interest, or such specific portion (exercisable in favor of such donee spouse, or of the estate of such donee spouse, or in favor of either, whether or not in each case the power is exercisable in favor of others), and with no power in any other person to appoint any part of such interest, or such portion, to any person other than the donee spouse --
(1) the interest, or such portion, so transferred shall, for purposes of subsection (a) be considered as transferred to the donee spouse, and
(2) no part of the interest, or such portion, so transferred shall, for purposes of subsection (b) (1), be considered as retained in the donor or transferred to any person other than the donee spouse. This subsection shall apply only if, by such transfer, such power in the donee spouse to appoint the interest, or such portion, whether exercisable by will or during life, is exercisable by such spouse alone and in all events.
(f) COMMUNITY P R O P E R T Y . --
(1) A deduction otherwise allowable under this section shall be allowed only to the extent that the transfer can be shown to represent a gift of property which is not, at the time of the gift, held as community property under the law of any State, Territory, or possession of the United States, or of any foreign country.
(2) For purposes of paragraph (1), community property (except property which is considered as community property solely by reason of paragraph (3)) shall not be considered as "held as community property" if the entire value of such property (and not merely one-half thereof) is treated as the amount of the gift.
(3) If during the calendar year 1942 or in succeeding calendar years, property held as such community property (unless considered by reason of paragraph (2) as not so held) was by the donor and the donee spouse converted, by one transaction or a series of transactions, into separate property of the donor and such spouse (including any form of coovvnership by them), the separate property so acquired by the donor and any property acquired at any time by the donor in exchange therefor (by one exchange or a series of exchanges) shall, for purposes of paragraph (1), be considered as "held as community property."
(4) Where the value (at the time of such conversion) of the separate property so acquired by the donor exceeded the value (at such time) of the separate property so acquired by such spouse, paragraph (3) shall apply only with respect to the same portion of such separate property of the donor as the portion which the value

414

(as of such time) of such separate property so acquired by such spouse is of the value (as of such time) of the separate property so acquired by the donor.
SEC. 2524. EXTENT OF DEDUCTIONS.
The deductions provided in sections 2522 and 2523 shall be allowed only to the extent that the gifts therein specified are included in the amount of gifts against which such deductions are applied.

The permission granted in this subsection shall apply (A) only to the extent that no discrimination is made against such instrumentality, so that if the rate of contribution is uniform upon all other persons subject to such law on account of having individuals in their employ, and upon aU employees of such persons, respectively, the contributions required of such instrumentality or the individuals in its employ shall not be at a greater rate than is required of such other persons and such employees, and if the rates are determined separately for different persons or classes of persons having individuals in their employ or for different classes of employees, the determination shall be based solely upon unemployment experience and other factors bearing a direct relation to unemployment risk, and (B) only if such State law makes provision for the refund of any contributions required under such law from an instrumentality of the United States or its employees for any year in the event said State is not certified by the Secretary of Labor under section 3304 with respect to such year.

(e) ASSESSMENT FOR DEFICIENCIES IN PRODUCTION AND EXCESS
OP M A T E R I A L S U S E D . --
(1) REQUIREMENT,--On the receipt of the distiller's return in each month, the Secretary or his delegate shall inquire and determine whether the distiller has accounted for all the grain or molasses used, and all the spirits produced by him in the preceding month. If he is satisfied t h a t the distiller has reported all the spirits produced by him, and the quantity so reported is found to be less than 80 percent of the producing capacity of the distillery as estimated according to law, he shall make an assessment for such deficiency at the rate of tax imposed by law for every proof gallon. In determining the quantity of grain used, 56 pounds shall be accounted as a bushel; and if the Secretary or his delegate finds t h a t the distiller has used any grain or molasses in excess of the capacity of his distillery as estimated according to law, he shall make an assessment against the distiller at the rate imposed by law for every proof gallon of spirits that should have been produced from the grain or molasses so used in excess, which assessment shall be made whether the quantity of spirits reported is equal to or exceeds 80 percent of the producing capacity of the distillery. If the Secretary or his delegate finds that the distiller has not accounted for all the spirits produced by him, he shall, from all the evidence he can obtain, determine what quantity of spirits was actually produced by such distiller, and an assessment shall be made for the difference between the quantity reported and the quantity shown to have been actually produced, at the rate of tax imposed by law for every proof gallon: Provided, That the actual product shall be assumed to be in no case less than 80 percent of the producing capacity of the distillery as estimated according to law. All assessments made under this subsection shall be a lien on all distilled spirits on the distillery premises, the distillery used for distilling the same, the stills, vessels, fixtures, and tools therein, the tract of land whereon the said distillery is located, and any building thereon, from the time such assessment is made until the same shall have been paid.
(2) R E L I E F FROM ASSESSMENT.--Whenever, under the provisions of this subsection, an assessment shall have been made against a distiller for a deficiency in not producing 80 percent of the producing capacity of his distillery as established by law, or for the tax upon the spirits that should have been produced from the grain or fruit or molasses found to have been used in excess of the capacity of his distillery for any month, as estimated according to law, such excessive use of grain or fruit or molasses having arisen from a failure on the part of the distiller to maintain the capacity required by law to enable him to use such grain or fruit or molasses without incurring liability to such assessment, and it shall be made to appear to the satisfaction of the Secretary or his delegate that said deficiency, or said failure, whereby such excessive use of grain, molasses, or fruit arose, was not occasioned by any want of diligence or by any fraudulent purpose on the part of the distiller, but from misunderstanding as to the requirements of the law and regulations in that respect or by reason of unavoidable accidents, then, and in such case, the Secretary or his delegate, subject to regulations pre-

For purposes of this subsection, an amount shall not be considered as required to be paid unless shown on the return or assessed as a deficiency (or as interest or addition to the tax), and an amount assessed as a deficiency (or as interest or addition to the tax) shall be considered to be required to be paid prior to the date of filing of the statement if the 10th day after notice and demand for its payment occurs prior to such date.

The Secretary or his delegate shall terminate the extension as to any part of the amount to which it relates which he deems should be terminated because, upon such examination, he believes that, as of the time such examination is made, all or any part of the statement clearly is in a material respect erroneous or unreasonable.
(g) PAYMENTS ON TERMINATION.--If an extension of time is terminated under subsection (e) or (f) with respect to any amount, then--
(1) no further extension of time shall be made under this section with respect to such amount, and
(2) the time for payment of such amount shall be considered to be the dates on which payments would have been required if there had been no extension with respect to such amount and the taxpayer had elected to pay the tax in installments as provided in section 6152.

(b) EXCEPTIONS TO RESTRICTIONS ON ASSESSMENT.--
(1) MATHEMATICAL ERRORS.--If the taxpayer is notified that, on account of a mathematical error appearing upon the return, an amount of tax in excess of that shown upon the return is due, and that an assessment of the tax has been or will be made on the basis of what would have been the correct amount of tax but for the mathematical error, such notice shall not be considered as a notice of deficiency for the purposes of subsection (a) (prohibiting assessment and collection until notice of the deficiency has been mailed), or of section 6212 (c) (1) (restricting further deficiency letters), or section 6512 (a) (prohibiting credits or refunds after petition to the Tax Court), and the taxpayer shall have no right to file a petition with the Tax Court based on such notice, nor shall such assessment or collection be prohibited by the provisions of subsection (a) of this section.

(3) ASSESSMENT OF AMOUNT PAID.--Any amount paid as a tax or in respect of a tax may be assessed upon the receipt of such payment notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a). In any case where such amount is paid after the mailing of a notice of deficiency under section 6212, such payment shall not deprive the Tax Court of jurisdiction over such deficiency determined under section 6211 without regard to such assessment.
(c) FAILURE T o F I L E PETITION.--If the taxpayer does not file a petition with the Tax Court within the time prescribed in subsection (a), the deficiency, notice of which has been mailed to the taxpayer, shall be assessed, and shall be paid upon notice and demand from the Secretary or his delegate.
