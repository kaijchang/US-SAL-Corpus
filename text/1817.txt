Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America, in Congress assembled, That, from and after the third day of March next, the offices of accountant and additional accountant

of the Department of War, the office of accountant of the navy, and the
office of superintendent general of military supplies, be, and they are hereby abolished.

Sec . 2. And be it further enacted, That, from and after the said third

day of March next, all claims and demands whatever, by the United

States or against them, and all accounts whatever, in which the United

States are concerned, either as debtors or as creditors, shall be settled

and adjusted in the Treasury Department.

Sec . 3. And be it further enacted, That, from and after the third day

of March next, in addition to the officers in the Treasury Department, al-

ready established by law, there shall be the following officers, namely,

four auditors and one comptroller.

w

Sec . 4. And be it further enacted, That it shall be the duty of the

first auditor to receive all accounts accruing in the Treasury Department,

and, after examination, to certify the balance and transmit the accounts,

with the vouchers and certificate to the first comptroller for his decision

thereon; that it shall be the duty of the second auditor to receive all

accounts relative to the pay and clothing of the army, the subsistence

of officers, bounties, and premiums, military and hospital stores, and the

contingent expenses of the War Department; that it shall be the duty of

the third auditor to receive all accounts relative to the subsistence of the

army, the quartermaster's department, and generally all accounts of the

War Department other than those provided for; and it shall be the duty

of the fourth auditor to receive all accounts accruing in the navy de-

partment, or relative thereto, and the second, third, and fourth auditors,

aforesaid, shall examine the accounts respectively, and certify the

balance, and transmit the accounts, with the vouchers and certificate, to

the second comptroller for his decision thereon; and it shall be the duty

of the fifth auditor to receive all accounts accruing in, or relative to, the

department of state, the general post office, and those arising out of

Indian affairs, and examine the same, and thereafter certify the balance,

and transmit the accounts, with the vouchers and certificate, to the first

comptroller for his decision thereon : Provided, That the President of the

United States may assign to the second or third auditor the settlement

of the accounts which are now confided to the additional accountant of

the War Department.

(a) The comptroller of the treasury has a right to direct the marshal to whom he shall pay money received upon executions, and a payment according to such directions is good; and it seems he may avail himself of it upon the trial without having submitted it as a claim to the accounting officers of the
treasury. United States v. Giles, 9 Cranch, 212; 3 Cond. Rep. 377.
No debtor to the United States can at the trial set off a claim for a debt due to him by the United States, unless such claim shall have been submitted to the accounting officers of the treasury, and by
them rejected, except in cases provided for by the statute. Ibid.
The rules prescribed by the Treasury Department for the adjustment of claims against the government, will, if reasonable, be respected ; but if these rules go to a complete denial ofjustice, the court, if
it have jurisdiction of the subject, cannot disregard the rights of parties. United States v. Mann, 2

to such balances. The United States v. Edwards, 1 M'Lean's C. C. R. 467. By the act of 1817, ch. 38, § 5, the above act is made to take effect from its date.

Cha p. XLV.--An Act to provide for the prompt settlement of public accounts, (a)

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America, in Congress assembled, That, from and after the third day of March next, the offices of accountant and additional accountant

of the Department of War, the office of accountant of the navy, and the
office of superintendent general of military supplies, be, and they are hereby abolished.

Sec . 2. And be it further enacted, That, from and after the said third

day of March next, all claims and demands whatever, by the United

States or against them, and all accounts whatever, in which the United

States are concerned, either as debtors or as creditors, shall be settled

and adjusted in the Treasury Department.

Sec . 3. And be it further enacted, That, from and after the third day

of March next, in addition to the officers in the Treasury Department, al-

ready established by law, there shall be the following officers, namely,

four auditors and one comptroller.

w

Sec . 4. And be it further enacted, That it shall be the duty of the

first auditor to receive all accounts accruing in the Treasury Department,

and, after examination, to certify the balance and transmit the accounts,

with the vouchers and certificate to the first comptroller for his decision

thereon; that it shall be the duty of the second auditor to receive all

accounts relative to the pay and clothing of the army, the subsistence

of officers, bounties, and premiums, military and hospital stores, and the

contingent expenses of the War Department; that it shall be the duty of

the third auditor to receive all accounts relative to the subsistence of the

army, the quartermaster's department, and generally all accounts of the

War Department other than those provided for; and it shall be the duty

of the fourth auditor to receive all accounts accruing in the navy de-

partment, or relative thereto, and the second, third, and fourth auditors,

aforesaid, shall examine the accounts respectively, and certify the

balance, and transmit the accounts, with the vouchers and certificate, to

the second comptroller for his decision thereon; and it shall be the duty

of the fifth auditor to receive all accounts accruing in, or relative to, the

department of state, the general post office, and those arising out of

Indian affairs, and examine the same, and thereafter certify the balance,

comptroller for his decision thereon : Provided, That the President of the

United States may assign to the second or third auditor the settlement

of the accounts which are now confided to the additional accountant of

the War Department.

(a) The comptroller of the treasury has a right to direct the marshal to whom he shall pay money received upon executions, and a payment according to such directions is good; and it seems he may avail himself of it upon the trial without having submitted it as a claim to the accounting officers of the
treasury. United States v. Giles, 9 Cranch, 212; 3 Cond. Rep. 377.
No debtor to the United States can at the trial set off a claim for a debt due to him by the United States, unless such claim shall have been submitted to the accounting officers of the treasury, and by
them rejected, except in cases provided for by the statute. Ibid.
The rules prescribed by the Treasury Department for the adjustment of claims against the government, will, if reasonable, be respected ; but if these rules go to a complete denial ofjustice, the court, if
it have jurisdiction of the subject, cannot disregard the rights of parties. United States v. Mann, 2
Brockenb. C. C. R. 96. A transcript from the treasury which contains sums charged in gross as balances, is not evidence as
to such balances. The United States v. Edwards, 1 M'Lean's C. C. R. 467. By the act of 1817, ch. 38, § 5, the above act is made to take effect from its date.

Sec . 2. And be itfurther enacted, That the superior courts in each of the territorial districts, and the circuit courts and other courts of the United States, of similar jurisdiction in criminal causes, in each district of the United States, in which any offender against this act shall be first apprehended or brought for trial, shall have, and are hereby invested with, full power and authority to hear, try, and punish, all crimes, offences, and misdemeanors, against this act; such courts proceeding therein in the same manner as if such crimes, offences, and misdemeanors, had been committed within the bounds of their respective districts: Provided, That nothing in this act shall be so construed as to affect any treaty now in force between the United States and any Indian nation, or to extend to any offence committed by one Indian against another, within any Indian boundary.

(a) Congress have power to regulate commerce among the Indian tribes, which affords a wide scope for legislation. Under a similar power as regards foreign relations, Congress have passed non intercourse acts, acts laying embargoes, and other acts which are admitted to be constitutional. United States v. Baily, 1 McLean's C. C. R. 234.
Congress have a right to select the means which have a direct relation to the object, in the regulation of commerce with the Indians. Such are the provisions of the act of 1802. Ibid.
But Congress cannot under this investure of power exercise a general jurisdiction over an Indian territory within a state. In a territory of the United States, in which Congress possesses legislative power, there can be no objection to the exercise of the power. Ibid.
Congress cannot punish for an offence, within the Indian territory, in a state, which has no relation to the Indians, and which cannot affect their commerce. Ibid.
The act of March 3, 1817, ch. 92, which assumes to exercise a general jurisdiction over Indian countries, within a state, is unconstitutional and of no effect. Ibid.
The crime of murder, charged against a white man for killing another white man in the Cherokee country, within the State of Tennessee,cannot be punished in the courts of the United States. Ibid.

Nor shall any thing in this act be construed to repeal, alter, or affect, any of the provisions of any former act, pledging the faith of the United States to the payment of the interest or principal of the public debt, but all such payments shall con-

(a) Congress have power to regulate commerce among the Indian tribes, which affords a wide scope for legislation. Under a similar power as regards foreign relations, Congress have passed non intercourse acts, acts laying embargoes, and other acts which are admitted to be constitutional. United States v. Baily, 1 McLean's C. C. R. 234.
Congress have a right to select the means which have a direct relation to the object, in the regulation of commerce with the Indians. Such are the provisions of the act of 1802. Ibid.
But Congress cannot under this investure of power exercise a general jurisdiction over an Indian territory within a state. In a territory of the United States, in which Congress possesses legislative power, there can be no objection to the exercise of the power. Ibid.
Congress cannot punish for an offence, within the Indian territory, in a state, which has no relation to the Indians, and which cannot affect their commerce. Ibid.
The act of March 3, 1817, ch. 92, which assumes to exercise a general jurisdiction over Indian countries, within a state, is unconstitutional and of no effect. Ibid.
The crime of murder, charged against a white man for killing another white man in the Cherokee country, within the State of Tennessee,cannot be punished in the courts of the United States. Ibid.

ARTICLES OF A TREATY

July 8, 1817.
Proclamation, Dec. 26, 1817.

Concluded, at the Cherokee Agency, within the Cherokee nation, between major general Andrew Jackson, Joseph M'Minn, governor of the state of Tennessee, and general David Meriwether, commissioners plenipotentiary of the United States of America, of the one part, and the chiefs, head men, and warriors, of the Cherokee nation, east of the Alississippi river, and the chiefs, head men, and ivarriors, of the Cherokees on the Arkansas river, and their deputies, John D. Chisholm and James Rogers, duly authorized by the chiefs of the Cherokees on the Arkansas river, in open council, by written power of attorney, duly signed and executed, in presence of Joseph
Sevier and William Ware.

Preamble.

Whe re as in the autumn of the year one thousand eight hundred and eight, a deputation from the Upper and Lower Cherokee towns, duly authorized by their nation, went on to the city of Washington, the first named to declare to the President of the United States their anxious
desire to engage in the pursuits of agriculture and civilized life, in the country they then occupied, and to make known to the President of the United States the impracticability of inducing the nation at large to do this, and to request the establishment of a division line between the upper and lower towns, so as to include all the waters of the Hiwassee river to the upper town, that, by thus contracting their society within narrow limits, they proposed to begin the establishment of fixed laws and a regular government: The deputies from the lower towns to make known their desire to continue the hunter life, and also the scarcity of game where they then lived, and, under those circumstances, their wish to remove across the Mississippi river, on some vacant lands of the United States. And whereas the President of the United States, after maturely considering the petitions of both parties, on the ninth day of January, A. D. one thousand eight hundred and nine, including other subjects, answered those petitions as follows: "The United States, my children, are the friends of both parties, and, as far as can be reasonably asked, they are willing to satisfy the wishes of both. Those who remain may be assured of our patronage, our aid, and good neighborhood. Those who wish to remove, are permitted to send an exploring party to reconnoitre the country on the waters of the Arkansas and White rivers, and the higher up the better, as they will be the longer unapproached by our settlements, which will begin at the mouths of
those rivers. The regular districts of the government of St. Louis are already laid off to the St. Francis.
" When this party shall have found a tract of country suiting the emigrants, and not claimed by other Indians, we will arrange with them and you the exchange of that for a just portion of the country they leave, and to a part of which, proportioned to their numbers, they have a right. Every aid towards their removal, and what will be necessary for them

And whereas the Cherokees, relying on the promises of the President of the United States, as above recited, did explore the country on the west side of the Mississippi, and made choice of the country on the Arkansas and White rivers, and settled themselves down upon United States' lands, to which no other tribe of Indians have any just claim, and have duly notified the President of the United States thereof, and of their anxious desire for the full and complete ratification of his promise, and, to that end, as notified by the President of the United States, have sent on their agents, with full powers to execute a treaty, relinquishing to the United States all the right, title, and interest, to all lands of right to them belonging, as part of the Cherokee nation, which they have left, and which they are about to leave, proportioned to their numbers, including, with those now on the Arkansas, those who are about to remove thither, and to a portion of which they have an equal right agreeably to their numbers.
Now, know ye, that the contracting parties, to carry into full effect the before recited promises with good faith, and to promote a continuation of friendship with their brothers on the Arkansas river, and for that purpose to make an equal distribution of the annuities secured to be paid by the United States to the whole Cherokee nation, have agreed and concluded on the following articles, viz :

Cession of lands to U. S. in exchange for other lands.

Art . 2. The chiefs, head men, and warriors, of the whole Cherokee nation, do also cede to the United States all the lands lying north and west of the following boundary lines, viz : Beginning at the Indian boundary line that runs from the north bank of the Tennessee river, opposite to the mouth of Hywassee river, at a point on the top of Walden's ridge, where it divides the waters of the Tennessee river from those of the Sequatchie river ; thence, along the said ridge, southwardly, to the bank of the Tennessee river, at a point near to a place called the Negro Sugar Camp, opposite to the upper end of the first island above Running Water Town; thence, westwardly, a straight line to the mouth of Little Sequatchie river; thence, up said river, to its main fork; thence, up its northernmost fork, to its source; and thence, due west, to the Indian boundary line.

Art . 5. The United States bind themselves, in exchange for the lands ceded in the first and second articles hereof, to give to that part of the Cherokee nation on the Arkansas as much land on said river and White river as they have or may hereafter receive from the Cherokee nation east of the Mississippi, acre for acre, as the just proportion due that part of the nation on the Arkansas agreeably to their numbers; which is to commence on the north side of the Arkansas river, at the mouth of Point Remove or Budwell's Old Place; thence, by a straight line, northwardly, to strike Chataunga mountain, or the hill first above Shield's Ferry on White river, running up and between said rivers for complement, the banks of which rivers to be the lines; and to have the above line, from the point of beginning to the point on White river, run and marked, which shall be done soon after the ratification of this treaty; and all citizens of the United States, except Mrs. P Lovely, who is to remain where she lives during life, removed from within the bounds as above named.

CONVENTION WITH GREAT BRITAIN.

231

DECLARATION.
The undersigned, his Britannick majesty's charge d'affaires in the United States of America, is commanded by his royal highness the Prince Regent, acting in the name and on the behalf of his majesty, to explain and declare, upon the exchange of the ratifications of the Convention concluded at London, on the third of July of the present year, for regulating the commerce and navigation between the two countries, that, in consequence of events which have happened in Europe subsequent to the signature of the Convention aforesaid, it has been deemed expedient, and determined, in conjunction with the allied sovereigns that St. Helena shall be the place allotted for the future residence of general Napoleon Bonaparte, under such regulations as may be necessary for the perfect security of his person, and it has been resolved, for that purpose, that all ships and vessels whatever, as well British ships and vessels as others, excepting only ships belonging to the East-India company, shall be excluded from all communication with, or approach
to, that Island. It has therefore become impossible to comply with so much of the
third article of the treaty as relates to the liberty of touching for refreshment at the Island of St. Helena, and the ratifications of the said treaty will be exchanged under the explicit declaration and understanding, that the vessels of the United States cannot be allowed to touch at, or hold any communication whatever with, the said Island, so long as the said Island shall continue to be the place of residence of the said
Napoleon Bonaparte.(a)

Declaration of 24th Nov. 1815.
All vessels, except those of the East India Company, exeluded from approaching the Island. Vessels of the U. S. must not touch at St. Helena.

On lake Ontario, to one vessel not exceeding one hundred tons burden, and armed with one eighteen pound cannon.
On the upper lakes, to two vessels, not exceeding like burden each, and armed with like force.
On the waters of lake Champlain, to one vessel not exceeding like burden, and armed with like force.
All other armed vessels on these lakes shall be forthwith dismantled, and no other vessels of war shall be there built or armed.
If either party should hereafter be desirous of annulling this stipulation, and should give notice to that effect to the other party, it shall cease to be binding after the expiration of six months from the date of such notice.
The naval force so to be limited shall be restricted to such services as will, in no respect, interfere with the proper duties of the armed vessels of the other party.
