SEC. 105. CONSIDERATION FOR FEDERAL FUNDING.
Nothing in this Act shall preclude a State, local, or tribal government that already complies with all or part of the Federal intergovernmental mandates included in the bill, joint resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report from consideration for

PUBLIC LAW 104-4--MAR. 22, 1995

109 STAT. 63

Federal funding under section 425(a)(2) of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (as added by section 101 of this Act) for the cost of the mandate, including the costs the State, local, or tribal government is currently paying and any additional costs necessary to meet the mandate.

SEC. 106. IMPACT ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.
(a) FINDINGS.--^The Senate finds that-- (1) the Congress should be concerned about shifting costs
from Federal to State and local authorities and should be equally concerned about the growing tendency of States to shift costs to local governments;
(2) cost shifting from States to local governments has, in many instances, forced local governments to raise property taxes or curtail sometimes essential services; and
(3) increases in local property taxes and cuts in essential services threaten the ability of many citizens to attain and maintain the American dream of owning a home in a safe, secure community.
(b) SENSE OF THE SENATE.--It is the sense of the Senate that--
(1) the Federal Government should not shift certain costs to the State, and States should end the practice of shifting costs to local governments, which forces many local governments to increase property taxes;
(2) States should end the imposition, in the absence of full consideration by their legislatures, of State issued mandates on local governments without adequate State funding, in a manner that may displace other essential government priorities; and
(3) one primary objective of this Act and other efforts to change the relationship among Federal, State, and local governments should be to reduce taxes and spending at all levels and to end the practice of shifting costs from one level of government to another with little or no benefit to taxpayers.

(b) COMMITTEE ON RULES REPORTS ON WAIVED POINTS OF
ORDER.--^The Committee on Rules shall include in the report required by clause 1(d) of rule XI (relating to its activities during the Congress) of the Rules of the House of Representatives a separate item identifying all waivers of points of order relating to Federal mandates, listed by bill or joint resolution number and the subject matter of that measure.

"(c) EFFECTIVE DATE.--(1) The amendments made by this sec-
tion shall only apply-- "(A) in 15 States (as determined by the Secretary of Health
and Human Services) and such other States as elect such amendments to apply to them, and
"(B) subject to paragraph (2), during the 6y2-year period beginning with 1992. For purposes of this paragraph, the term 'State' has the meaning given such term by section 210(h) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 410(h)). "(2)(A) The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall conduct a study that compares the health care costs, quality of care, and access to services under medicare select policies with that under other medicare supplemental policies. The study shall be based on surveys of appropriate age-adjusted sample populations. The study shall be completed by June 30, 1997. "(B) Not later than December 31, 1997, the Secretary shall determine, based on the results of the study under subparagraph (A), if any of the following findings are true:
"(i) The amendments made by this section have not resulted in savings of premium costs to those enrolled in medicare select policies (in comparison to their enrollment in medicare supplemental policies that are not medicare select policies and that provide comparable coverage).
"(ii) There have been significant additional expenditures under the medicare program as a result of such amendments.
"(iii) Access to and quality of care has been significantly diminished as a result of such amendments. "(C) The amendments made by this section shall remain in effect beyond the 6y2-year period described in paragraph (1)(B) unless the Secretary determines that any of the findings described in clause (i), (ii), or (iii) of subparagraph (B) are true. "(3) The Comptroller (General shall conduct a study to determine the extent to which individuals who are continuously covered under

PUBLIC LAW 104-18-JULY 7, 1995

109 STAT. 193

a medicare supplemental policy are subject to medical underwriting if they change the policy under which they are covered, and to identify options, if necessary, for modifying the medicare supplemental insurance market to make sure that continuously insured beneficiaries are able to switch plans without medical underwriting. By not later than June 30, 1996, the Comptroller General shall submit to the Congress a report on the study. The report shall include a description of the potential impact on the cost and availability of medicare supplemental policies of each option identified in the study.".

ING OF CRACK SENTENCES AND SENTENCES FOR
MONEY LAUNDERING AND TRANSACTIONS IN PROP-

In accordance with section 994(p) of title 28, United States Code, amendments numbered 5 and 18 of the "Amendments to the Sentencing Guidehnes, Policy Statements, and Official Commentary", submitted by the United States Sentencing Commission to Congress on May 1, 1995, are hereby disapproved and shall not take effect.

SEC. 2. REDUCTION OF SENTENCING DISPARITY.
(a) RECOMMENDATIONS.--
(1) I N GENERAL.--^The United States Sentencing Commission shall submit to Congress recommendations (and an explanation therefor), regarding changes to the statutes and sentencing guidelines governing sentences for unlawful manufacturing, importing, exporting, and trafficking of cocaine, and like offenses, including unlawful possession, possession with intent to commit any of the forgoing offenses, and attempt and conspiracy to commit any of the forgoing offenses. The recommendations shall reflect the following considerations--
(A) the sentence imposed for trafficking in a quantity of crack cocaine should generally exceed the sentence imposed for trafficking in a like quantity of powder cocaine;
(B) high-level wholesale cocaine traffickers, organizers, and leaders, of criminal activities should generally receive longer sentences than low-level retail cocaine trsiffickers and those who played a minor or minimal role in such criminal activity;
(C) if the Government establishes that a defendant who traffics in powder cocaine has knowledge that such cocaine will be converted into crack cocaine prior to its distribution to individual users, the defendant should be treated at sentencing as though the defendant had trafAcked in crack cocaine; and

PUBLIC LAW 104-38--OCT. 30, 1995

109 STAT. 335

(D) an enhanced sentence should generally be imposed on a defendant who, in the course of an offense described in this subsection--
(i) murders or causes serious bodily injury to an individual;
(ii) uses a dangerous weapon; (iii) uses or possesses a firearm; (iv) involves a juvenile or a woman who the defendant knows or should know to be pregnant;
(v) engages in a continuing criminal enterprise or commits other criminal offenses in order to facilitate his drug trafficking activities;
(vi) knows, or should know, that he is involving an unusually vulnerable person;
(vii) restrains a victim;
(viii) traffics in cocaine within 500 feet of a school; (ix) obstriicts justice; (x) has a significant prior criminal record; or (xi) is an organizer or leader of drug trafficking activities involving five or more persons. (2) RATIO.--The recommendations described in the preceding subsection shall propose revision of the drug quantity ratio of crack cocaine to powder cocaine under the relevant statutes and guidelines in a manner consistent with the ratios set for other drugs and consistent with the objectives set forth in section 3553(a) of title 28 United States Code. (b) STUDY.--No later than May 1, 1996, the Department of Justice shall submit to the Judiciary Committees of the Senate and House of Representatives a report on the charging and plea practices of Federal prosecutors with respect to the offense of money laundering. Such study shall include an account of the steps taken or to be taken by the Justice Department to ensure consistency and appropriateness in the use of the money laundering statute. The Sentencing Commission shall submit to the Judiciary Committees comments on the study prepared by the Department of Justice.

lawfully distributed together as a unit for public performance or sale in the United States, if no more than three such selections are transmitted consecutively: Provided, That the transmission of selections in excess of the numerical limits provided for in clauses (A) and (B) from multiple phonorecords shall nonetheless qualify as a sound recording performance complement if the programming of the multiple phonorecords was not willfully intended to avoid the numerical limitations prescribed in such clauses.

"(3)(A) A compulsory license under this section includes the right of the compulsory licensee to distribute or authorize the distribution of a phonorecord of a nondramatic musical work by means of a digital transmission which constitutes a digital phonorecord delivery, regardless of whether the digital transmission is also a public performance of the sound recording under section 106(6) of this title or of any nondramatic musical work embodied therein under section 106(4) of this title. For every digital phonorecord delivery by or under the authority of the compulsory licensee--
"(i) on or before December 31, 1997, the royalty payable by the compulsory licensee shall be the royalty prescribed
under paragraph (2) and chapter 8 of this title; and "(ii) on or after January 1, 1998, the royalty payable
by the compulsory licensee shall be the royalty prescribed
under subparagraphs (B) through (F) and chapter 8 of this title. "(B) Notwithstanding any provision of the antitrust laws, any copyright owners of nondramatic musical works and any persons entitled to obtain a compulsory license under subsection (a)(1) may negotiate and agree upon the terms and rates of royalty payments under this paragraph and the proportionate division of fees paid among copyright owners, and may designate common agents to negotiate, agree to, pay or receive such royalty payments. Such authority to negotiate the terms and rates of royalty payments includes, but is not limited to, the authority to negotiate the year during which the royalty rates prescribed under subparagraphs (B) through (F) and chapter 8 of this title shall next be determined.
"(C) During the period of June 30, 1996, through December 31, 1996, the Librarian of Congress shall cause notice to be published in the Federal Register of the initiation of voluntary negotiation proceedings for the purpose of determining reasonable terms and rates of royalty pajmients for the activities specified by subparagraph (A) during the period beginning January 1, 1998, and ending on the effective date of any new terms and rates established pursuant to subparagraph (C), (D) or (F), or such other date (regarding digital phonorecord deliveries) as the parties may agree. Such terms and rates shall distinguish between (i) digital phonorecord deliveries where the reproduction or distribution of a phonorecord is incidental to the transmission which constitutes the digital phonorecord delivery, and (ii) digital phonorecord deliveries in general. Any copyright owners of nondramatic musical works and any persons entitled to obtain a compulsory license under subsection (a)(1) may submit to the Librarian of Congress licenses covering such activities. The parties to each negotiation proceeding shall bear their own costs.
"(D) In the absence of license agreements negotiated under subparagraphs (B) and (C), upon the filing of a petition in accordance with section 803(a)(1), the Librarian of Congress shall, pursuant to chapter 8, convene a copyright arbitration royalty panel to determine and publish in the Federal Register a schedule of rates and terms which, subject to subparagraph

"(ii) The second sentence of clause (i) shall not apply to-- "(I) a contract entered into on or before June 22, 1995,
and not modified thereafter for the purpose of reducing the royalty rates determined pursuant to subparagraph (C), (D) or (F) or of increasing the number of musical works within the scope of the contract covered by the reduced rates, except if a contract entered into on or before June 22, 1995, is modified thereafter for the purpose of increasing the number of musical works within the scope of the contract, any contrary royalty rates specified in the contract shall be given effect in lieu of royalty rates determined pursuant to subparagraph (C), (D) or (F) for the number of musical works within the scope of the contract as of June 22, 1995; and

"(I) The liability of the cop3rright owner of a sound recording for infringement of the copyright in a nondramatic musical work embodied in the sound recording shall be determined in accordance with applicable law, except that the owner of a copyright in a sound recording shall not be liable for a digital phonorecord delivery by a third party if the owner of the copyright in the sound recording does not license the distribution of a phonorecord of the nondramatic musical work.
"(J) Nothing in section 1008 shall be construed to prevent the exercise of the rights and remedies allowed by this paragraph, paragraph (6), and chapter 5 in the event of a digital phonorecord delivery, except that no action alleging infringement of copyright may be brought under this title against a manufacturer, importer or distributor of a digital audio recording device, a digital audio recording medium, an analog recording device, or an analog recording medium, or against a consumer, based on the actions described in such section.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.
(a) FINDINGS.--Congress finds the following: (1) A combination of accumulated operating deficits, cash
shortages, management inefficiencies, and deficit spending in the current fiscal year have created a fiscal emergency in the District of Columbia.
(2) As a result of its current financial problems and management inefficiencies, the District of Columbia government fails to provide its citizens with effective and efficient services in areas such as education, health care, crime prevention, trash collection, drug abuse treatment and prevention, human services delivery, and the supervision and training of government personnel.
(3) The current financial and management problems of the District government have already adversely affected the long-term economic health of the District of Columbia by causing the migration of residents and businesses out of the District of Columbia and the failure of new residents and businesses to move to the District of Columbia.
(4) The fiscal and management problems in the District of Columbia government are pervasive across all segments of the government.
(5) A comprehensive approach to fiscal, management, and structural problems must be undertaken which exempts no part of the District government and which preserves home rule for the citizens of the District of Columbia.
(6) The current deficit of the District of Columbia must be resolved over a multi-year period, since it cannot be effectively addressed in a single year.

SEC. 402. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.--(a) FINDINGS.--^The Congress finds that--
(1) affordable public transportation is essential to the economic vitality of the national capital area and is an essential component of regional efforts to improve air quality to meet environmental requirements and to improve the health of both residents of and visitors to the national capital area as well as to preserve the beauty and dignity of the Nation's capital;
(2) use of mass transit by both residents of and visitors to the national capital area is substantially affected by the prices charged for such mass transit services, prices that are substantially affected by labor costs, since more than % of operating costs are attributable to labor costs;
(3) labor costs incurred in providing mass transit in the national capital area have increased at an alarming rate and wages and benefits of operators and mechanics currently are among the highest in the Nation;
(4) higher operating costs incurred for public transit in the national capital area cannot be offset by increasing costs to patrons, since this often discourages ridership and thus undermines the public interest in promoting the use of public transit;
(5) spiraling labor costs cannot be offset by the governmental entities that are responsible for subsidy payments for public transit services since local governments generally, and the District of Columbia government in particular, are operating under severe fiscal constraints;
(6) imposition of mandatory standards applicable to arbitrators resolving arbitration disputes involving interstate compact agencies operating in the national capital area will ensure that wage increases are justified and do not exceed the ability of transit patrons and taxpayers to fund the increase; and
(7) Federal legislation is necessary under Article I of section 8 of the United States Constitution to balance the need to moderate and lower labor costs while maintaining industrial peace. (b) PURPOSE.--It is therefore the purpose of this Act to adopt standards governing arbitration which must be applied by arbitrators resolving disputes involving interstate compact agencies operat-

PUBLIC LAW 104-50--NOV. 15, 1995

ing in the national capital area in order to lower operating costs for public transportation in the Washington metropolitan area.
SEC. 403. DEFINITIONS.--^As used in this title--
(1) the term "arbitration" means-- (A) the arbitration of disputes, regarding the terms
and conditions of employment, that is required under an interstate compact governing an interstate compact agency operating in the national capital area; and
(B) does not include the interpretation and application of rights arising from an existing collective bargaining agreement;
(2) the term "arbitrator" refers to either a single arbitrator, or a board of arbitrators, chosen under applicable procedures;
(3) an interstate compact agency's "funding ability" is the ability of the interstate compact agency, or of any governmental jurisdiction which provides subsidy pa)mients or budgetary assistance to the interstate compact agency, to obtain the necessary financial resources to pay for wage and benefit increases for employees of the interstate compact agency;
(4) the term "interstate compact agency operating in the national capital area" means any interstate compact agency which provides public transit services;
(5) the term "interstate compact agency" means any agency established by an interstate compact to which the District of Columbia is a signatory; and
(6) the term "public welfare" includes, with respect to arbitration under an interstate compact--
(A) the financial ability of the individual jurisdictions participating in the compact to pay for the costs of providing public transit services; and
(B) the average per capita tax burden, during the term of the collective bargaining agreement to which the arbitration relates, of the residents of the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, and the effect of an arbitration award rendered pursuant to such arbitration on the respective income or property tax rates of the jurisdictions which provide subsidy payments to the interstate compact agency established under the compact.
SEC. 404. STANDARDS FOR ARBITRATORS.--(a) FACTORS IN MAK-
ING ARBITRATION AWARD.--^An arbitrator rendering an arbitration award involving the employees of an interstate compact agency operating in the national capital area may not make a finding or a decision for inclusion in a collective bargaining agreement governing conditions of employment without considering the following factors:
(1) The existing terms and conditions of employment of the employees in the bargaining unit.
(2) All available financial resources of the interstate compact agency.
(3) The annual increase or decrease in consumer prices for goods and services as reflected in the most recent consumer price index for the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor.
(4) The wages, benefits, and terms and conditions of the employment of other employees who perform, in other jurisdic-

PUBLIC LAW 104-50--NOV. 15, 1995

109 STAT. 465

tions in the Washington, D.C. standard metropoUtan statistical area, services similar to those in the bargaining unit.
(5) The special nature of the work performed by the employees in the bargaining unit, including any hazards or the relative ease of employment, physical requirements, educational qualifications, job training and skills, shift assignments, and the demands placed upon the employees as compared to other employees of the interstate compact agency.
(6) The interests and welfare of the employees in the bargaining unit, including--
(A) the overall compensation presently received by the employees, having regard not only for wage rates but also for wages for time not worked, including vacations, holidays, and other excused absences;
(B) all benefits received by the employees, including previous bonuses, insurgince, and pensions; and
(C) the continuity and stability of employment. (7) The public welfare. (b) COMPACT AGENCY'S FUNDING ABILITY.--An arbitrator rendering an arbitration award involving the employees of an interstate compact agency operating in the national capital area may not, with respect to a collective bargaining agreement governing conditions of employment, provide for salaries and other benefits that exceed the interstate compact agency's funding ability.
(c) REQUIREMENTS FOR FINAL AWARD.--^In resolving a dispute
submitted to arbitration involving the employees of an interstate compact agency operating in the national capital area, the arbitrator shall issue a written award that demonstrates that all the factors set forth in subsections (a) and (b) have been considered and applied. An award may grant an increase in pay rates or benefits (including insurance and pension benefits), or reduce hours of work, only if the arbitrator concludes that any costs to the agency do not adversely affect the public welfare. The arbitrators conclusion regarding the public welfare must be supported by substantial evidence.
SEC. 405. PROCEDURES FOR ENFORCEMENT OF AWARDS.--(a)
MODIFICATIONS AND FINALITY OF AWARD.--^In the case of an arbitration award to which section 404 applies, the interstate compact agency and the employees in the bargaining unit, through their representative, may agree in writing upon any modifications to the award within 10 days after the award is received by the parties. After the end of that 10-day period, the award, with any such modifications, shall become binding upon the interstate compact agency, the employees in the bargaining unit, and the employees' representative.
(b) IMPLEMENTATION.--^Each party to an award that becomes binding under subsection (a) shall take all actions necessary to implement the award.
(c) JUDICIAL REVIEW.--^Within 60 days after an award becomes binding under subsection (a), the interstate compact agency or the exclusive representative of the employees concerned may file a civil action in a court which has jurisdiction over the interstate compact agency for review of the award. The court shall review the award on the record, and shall vacate the award or any part of the award, after notice and a hearing, if--
(1) the award is in violation of applicable law; (2) the arbitrator exceeded the arbitrator's powers;

109 STAT. 466

PUBLIC LAW 104-50--NOV. 15, 1995

(3) the decision by the arbitrator is arbitrary or capricious; (4) the arbitrator conducted the hearing contrary to the provisions of this title or other statutes or rules that apply to the arbitration so as to substantially prejudice the rights of a party;
(5) there was partiality or misconduct by the arbitrator prejudicing the rights of a party;
(6) the award was procured by corruption, fraud, or bias on the part of the arbitrator; or
(7) the arbitrator did not comply with the provisions of section 404. This Act may be cited as the "Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1996".

(7) APPEAL.--^Any appeal from the final decision of a district court in an action brought pursuant to this subsection shall be filed not later than 30 days after the date of decision.

If the President determines that exports of this oil are in the national interest, he may impose such terms and conditions (other than a volume limitation) as are necessary or appropriate to ensure that such exports are consistent with the national interest.
"(2) Except in the case of oil exported to a country with which the United States entered into a bilateral international oil supply agreement before November 26, 1979, or to a country pursuant to the International Emergency Oil Sharing Plan of the International Energy Agency, any oil transported by pipeline over rightof-way granted pursuant to section 203 of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act (43 LT.S.C. 1652) shall, when exported, be transported by a vessel documented under the laws of the United States and owned by a citizen of the United States (as determined in accordance with section 2 of the Shipping Act, 1916 (46 U.S.C.

The Secretary of Commerce shall consult with the Secretary of Energy in administering the provisions of this subsection.
"(5) If the Secretary of Commerce finds that exporting oil under authority of this subsection has caused sustained material oil supply shortages or sustained oil prices significantly above world market levels and further finds that these supply shortages or price increases have caused or are likely to cause sustained material adverse employment effects in the United States, the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, shall recommend, and the President may take, appropriate action concerning exports of this oil, which may include modifying or revoking authority to export such oil.

Section 8(a) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1337(a)(3)), is amended--
(1) by designating the provisions of paragraph (3) as subparagraph (A) of such paragraph (3); and
(2) by inserting after subparagraph (A), as so designated, the following: "(B) In the Western and Central Planning Areas of the Gulf of Mexico and the portion of the Eastern Planning Area of the Gulf of Mexico encompassing whole lease blocks lying west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude, the Secretary may, in order to--
"(i) promote development or increased production on producing or non-producing leases; or
"(ii) encourage production of marginal resources on producing or non-producing leases; through primary, secondary, or tertiary recovery means, reduce or eliminate any royalty or net profit share set forth in the lease(s). With the lessee's consent, the Secretary may make other modifications to the royalty or net profit share terms of the lease in order to achieve these purposes. "(C)(i) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Act other than this subparagraph, with respect to any lease or unit in existence on the date of enactment of the Outer Continental Shelf Deep Water Royalty Relief Act meeting the requirements of this subparagraph, no royalty payments shall be due on new production, as defined in clause (iv) of this subparagraph, from any lease or unit located in water depths of 200 meters or greater in the Western and Central Planning Areas of the Gulf of Mexico, including that portion of the Eastern Planning Area of the Gulf of Mexico encompassing whole lease blocks lying west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude, until such volume of production as determined pursuant to clause (ii) has been produced by the lessee.
"(ii) Upon submission of a complete application by the lessee, the Secretary shall deteimine within 180 days of such application whether new production from such lease or unit would be economic in the absence of the relief from the requirement to pay royalties provided for by clause (i) of this subparagraph.

The lessee shall provide information required for a complete application to the Secretary prior to such determination. The Secretary shall clearly define the information required for a complete application under this section. Such application may be made on the basis of an individual lease or unit. If the Secretary determines that such new production would be economic in the absence of the relief from the requirement to pay royalties provided for by clause (i) of this subparagraph, the provisions of clause (i) shall not apply to such production. If the Secretary determines that such new production would not be economic in the absence of the relief from the requirement to pay royalties provided for by clause (i), the Secretary must determine the volume of production from the lease or unit on which no royalties would be due in order to make such new production economically viable; except that for new production as defined in clause (iv)(I), in no case will that volume be less than 17.5 million barrels of oil equivalent in water depths of 200 to 400 meters, 52.5 million barrels of oil equivalent in 400-800 meters of water, and 87.5 million barrels of oil equivalent in water depths greater than 800 meters. Redetermination of the applicability of clause (i) shall be undertaken by the Secretary when requested by the lessee prior to the commencement of the new production and upon significant change in the factors upon which the original determination was made. The Secretary shall make such redetermination within 120 days of submission of a complete application. The Secretary may extend the time period for making any determination or redetermination under this clause for 30 days, or longer if agreed to by the applicant, if circumstances so warrant. The lessee shall be notified in writing of any determination or redetermination and the reasons for and assumptions used for such determination.

"(iii) In the event that the Secretary fails to make the determination or redetermination called for in clause (ii) upon application by the lessee within the time period, together with any extension thereof, provided for by clause (ii), no royalty payments shall be due on new production as follows:
"(I) For new production, as defined in clause (iv)(I) of this subparagraph, no royalty shall be due on such production according to the schedule of minimum volumes specified in clause (ii) of this subparagraph.
"(II) For new production, as defined in clause (iv)(II) of this subparagraph, no royalty shall be due on such production for one year following the start of such production. "(iv) For purposes of this subparagraph, the term 'new production' is--
"(I) any production from a lease from which no royalties are due on production, other than test production, prior to the date of enactment of the Outer Continental Shelf Deep Water Royalty Relief Act; or
"(II) any production resulting from lease development activities pursuant to a Development Operations Coordination Document, or supplement thereto that would expand production significantly beyond the level anticipated in the Development

Any production subject to this clause shall be counted toward the production volume determined pursuant to clause (ii) or (iii). Estimated royalty payments will be made if such average of the closing prices for the previous year exceeds $28.00. After the end of the calendar year, when the new average price can be calculated, lessees will pay any royalties due, with interest but without penalty, or can apply for a refund, with interest, of any overpayment.
"(vi) During the production of volumes determined pursuant to clause (ii) or (iii) of this subparagraph, in any year during which the arithmetic average of the closing prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange for natural gas exceeds $3.50 per million British thermal units, any production of natural gas will be subject to royalties at the lease stipulated royalty rate. Any production subject to this clause shall be counted toward the production volume determined pursuant to clauses (ii) or (iii).

TITLE IV--FISHERMEN'S PROTECTIVE ACT
SEC. 401. FINDINGS.
The Congress finds that-- (1) customary international law and the United Nations
Convention on the Law of the Sea guarantee the right of passage, including innocent passage, to vessels through the waters commonly referred to as the "Inside Passage" off the Pacific Coast of Canada;
(2) in 1994 Canada required all commercial fishing vessels of the United States to pay 1,500 Canadian dollars to obtain a "license which authorizes transit" through the Inside Passage;
(3) this action was inconsistent with international law, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, and, in particular. Article 26 of that Convention, which specifically prohibits such fees, and threatened the safety of United States commercial fishermen who sought to avoid the fee by traveling in less protected waters;
(4) the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967 provides for the reimbursement of vessel owners who are forced to pay a license fee to secure the release of a vessel which has been seized, but does not permit reimbursement of a fee paid by the owner in advance in order to prevent a seizure;
(5) Canada required that the license fee be paid in person in 2 ports on the Pacific Coast of Canada, or in advance by mail;
(6) significant expense and delay was incurred by commercial fishing vessels of the United States that had to travel from the point of seizure back to one of those ports in order to pay the license fee required by Canada, and the costs of that travel and delay cannot be reimbursed under the Fishermen's Protective Act;
(7) the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967 should be amended to permit vessel owners to be reimbursed for fees required by a foreign government to be paid in advance in order to navigate in the waters of that foreign country if the United States considers that fee to be inconsistent with international law;
(8) the Secretary of State should seek to recover from Canada any amounts paid by the United States to reimburse vessel owners who paid the transit license fee;
(9) the United States should review its current policy with respect to anchorage by commercial fishing vessels of Canada

PUBLIC LAW 104-43--NOV. 3, 1995

109 STAT. 389

in waters of the United States off Alaska, including waters in and near the Dixon Entrance, and should accord such vessels the same treatment that commercial fishing vessels of the United States are accorded for anchorage in the waters of Canada off British Columbia;
(10) the President should ensure that, consistent with international law, the United States Coast Guard has available adequate resources in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska to provide for the safety of United States citizens, the enforcement of United States law, and to protect the rights of the United States and keep the peace among vessels operating in disputed waters;
(11) the President should continue to review all agreements between the United States and Canada to identify other actions that may be taken to convince Canada that any reinstatement of the transit license fee would be against Canada's long-term interests, and should immediately implement any actions which the President deems appropriate if Canada reinstates the fee;
(12) the President should continue to convey to Canada in the strongest teiTns that the United States will not now, nor at any time in the future, tolerate any action by Canada which would impede or otherwise restrict the right of passage of vessels of the United States in a manner inconsistent with international law; and
(13) the United States should continue its efforts to seek expeditious agreement with Canada on appropriate fishery conservation and management measures that can be implemented through the Pacific Salmon Treaty to address issues of mutual concern.
SEC. 402. AMENDMENT TO THE FISHERMEN'S PROTECTIVE ACT OF
1967.

SEC. 637. NATIONAL COMMISSION ON RESTRUCTURING THE
INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE.--
(a) FINDINGS.--^The Congress finds the following: (1) While the budget for the Internal Revenue Service
(hereafter referred to as the "IRS") has risen from $2.5 billion in fiscal year 1979 to $7.3 billion in fiscal year 1996, tax returns processing has not become significantly faster, tax collection rates have not significantly increased, and the accuracy and timeliness of taxpayer assistance has not significantly improved.
(2) To date, the Tax Systems Modernization (TSM) program has cost the taxpayers $2.5 billion, with an estimated cost of $8 billion. Despite this investment, modernization efforts were recently described by the GAO as "chaotic" and "ad hoc".
(3) While the IRS maintains that TSM will increase efficiency and thus revenues. Congress has had to appropriate additional funds in recent years for compliance initiatives in order to increase tax revenues.
(4) Because TSM has not been implemented, the IRS continues to rely on paper returns, processing a total of 14 billion pieces of paper every tax season. This results in an extremely inefficient system.
(5) This lack of efficiency reduces the level of customer service and impedes the ability of the IRS to collect revenue.
(6) The present status of the IRS shows the need for the establishment of a Commission which will examine the organization of IRS and recommend actions to expedite the implementation of TSM and improve service to taxpayers.
(b) COMPOSITION OF THE COMMISSION.--
(1) ESTABLISHMENT.--^To carry out the purposes of this section, there is established a National Commission on Restructuring the Internal Revenue Service (in this section referred to as the "Commission").
(2) COMPOSITION.--^The Commission shall be composed of thirteen members, as follows:
(A) Five members appointed by the President, two from the executive branch of the Government, two from private life, and one from an organization that represents a substantial number of Internal Revenue Service employees.
(B) Two members appointed by the Majority Leader of the Senate, one from Members of the Senate and one from private life.
(C) Two members appointed by the Minority Leader of the Senate, one from Members of the Senate and one from private life.
(D) Two members appointed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, one from Members of the House of Representatives and one from private life.
(E) Two members appointed by the Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, one from Members of the House of Representatives and one fi-om private life.

Proclamation 6764 of January 11,1995

National Good Teen Day, 1995

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
For many of the 24 million teenagers in the United States today, the future can seem uncertain and distant. Confronted with challenges the likes of which their parents could scarcely have imagined, many of our young people are too busy with the trials of daily life to spend much time hoping and dreaming. But empowered with the courage to try, all teens--even those who may feel troubled and lost--have the potential to succeed.
The choices teens make today will determine the future for all of us, and we must strive to set an example of hard work and responsible behavior. On the occasion of National Good Teen Day, we pause to recognize the teens who set just such an example for their peers--^young people who make invaluable contributions to our society, bringing their remarkable talents and energies to bear in their studies and activities, in caring for their families and friends, and in helping their communities. We can learn a lot from these youth, from the creativity, optimism, and resilience that enable them to navigate the complex path to adulthood.
In return for all they give, teens need our understanding, compassion, and love. They require our attention, and they deserve our respect. America's young people have so much to look forward to, so much to share with our world. With firm guidance and gentle reassurance, we can help teenagers to recognize their strengths and realize their dreams. 1
In celebration of teens throughout the Nation, the Congress, by Public Law 103-463, has designated January 16, 1995, as "National Good Teen Day" and has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this day.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim January 16, 1995, as National Good Teen Day. I urge all Americans to observe this day with appropriate programs and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of January, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninetyfive, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and nineteenth.

Proclamation 6765 of January 11,1995

109 STAT. 1745

Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday, 1995
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
As long as there is poverty in the world I can never be rich, even if I have a billion dollars I can never be what I ought to be until you are what you ought to be. This is the way our world is made. No individual or nation can stand out boasting of being independent. We are interdependent.
With resolution and eloquence, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., stirred people around the globe to action. He dedicated his life to ending the oppression of racism, and his vision of a nation driven by love instead of hate changed our world forever. We are all the beneficiaries of his legacy, and we are grateful.
Dr. King taught that the goals of civil rights are not merely the goals of any specific group--they are the goals of our Nation. To give people opportunity, to treat them with fairness, and to distinguish them only by their potential--we will continue to work toward these goals as long as people in this Nation are in need of housing, medical care, and subsistence. We will continue to work as long as neighborhoods are ravaged by drugs and violence. We will continue to work as long as any person, because of circumstance of birth, is granted anything less than the full measure of his or her dignity.
Three decades have passed since Dr. King stood in front of the Lincoln Memorial and told the world of his dream for a future in which our children are judged "not by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character." Today,, with an entire generation of voting Americans who did not witness firsthand the great civil rights victories of the 1960s, it is more important than ever to remind the Nation about Dr. King and his inestimable gifts to this country, so that all of us continue to grow in our commitment to justice and equality.
This year, the Martin Luther King, Jr., holiday is celebrated with a national day of service, a call to join together in purpose and care for one another. On this occasion, I urge the citizens of this great country to reflect upon Dr. King's teachings and to take positive and life-affirming action in his memory. Give back to your community, help the homeless, feed the hungry, attend to the sick, give to the needy. In whatever way you choose to serve the public good, do something to make life better for the people around you. As Dr. King said on many occasions, "Life's most persistent and urgent question is, 'What are you doing for others?*"
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 16, 1995, as the "Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday."
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of January, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-

Proclamation 6766 of January 17,1995
Year of the Grandparent, 1995
By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation
The American family has undergone dramatic changes in the past few decades. FamiHes have felt the effects of a rising divorce rate, declining birth rate, and an increasingly fast-paced and complicated economy. At the same time, Americans are living longer, retiring younger, and taking advantage of more leisure hours than ever before. Today, approximately 60 million grandparents in the United States look forward to spending time with their families and to enjoying their much-deserved respite.
Despite the many changes, grandparents remain an important source of knowledge and stability in American families. Grandparents help us understand the past and encourage us to hope for the future. They preserve and strengthen the values we hold most dear--compassion and generosity, responsibility and tradition. These relationships between generations have always been central to the happiness and well-being of young and old alike.
Households made up of several generations have increased by more than 50 percent in the past 25 years, and today, some 3.4 million children live in a household headed by a grandparent. For parents struggling with issues including substance abuse or teenage pregnancy, divorce or separation, grandparents can be invaluable resources of compassion. For children who are abused or neglected, grandparents can be lifesavers. All too often, grandparents embrace these tremendous responsibilities because no one else is able. But they also do so out of love, out of the wisdom that comes from a lifetime spent learning the importance of family. For all they teach us and for all they give, we pledge this year to honor grandparents everywhere.
The Congress, by Public Law 103-368, has designated 1995 as the "Year of the Grandparent" and has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this year.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim 1995 as the Year of the Grandparent. I invite Federal officials, local government, advocacy groups, and families across the United States to join in commemorating the many contributions that grandparents make and in observing this year with appropriate ceremonies, programs, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of January, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninetyfive, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and nineteenth.

Households made up of several generations have increased by more than 50 percent in the past 25 years, and today, some 3.4 million children live in a household headed by a grandparent. For parents struggling with issues including substance abuse or teenage pregnancy, divorce or separation, grandparents can be invaluable resources of compassion. For children who are abused or neglected, grandparents can be lifesavers. All too often, grandparents embrace these tremendous responsibilities because no one else is able. But they also do so out of love, out of the wisdom that comes from a lifetime spent learning the importance of family. For all they teach us and for all they give, we pledge this year to honor grandparents everywhere.
The Congress, by Public Law 103-368, has designated 1995 as the "Year of the Grandparent" and has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this year.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim 1995 as the Year of the Grandparent. I invite Federal officials, local government, advocacy groups, and families across the United States to join in commemorating the many contributions that grandparents make and in observing this year with appropriate ceremonies, programs, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of January, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninetyfive, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and nineteenth.

the development of heart disease. By controlling blood pressure and blood cholesterol, being physically active, and not smoking cigarettes, more Americans can have the chance to lead long, healthy lives.
The Federal Government has contributed to these successes by supporting research and education through the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Through its commitment to research, its programs to heighten public awareness, and its vital network of dedicated volunteers, the American Heart Association also has played a crucial role in bringing about these remarkable accomplishments.
Yet the heart has not revealed all of its mysteries. No one knows why heart disease begins. And, while it is known that heart disease develops differently in men and women, the reasons for those variations are still being studied. About 5(3 million Americans continue to suffer from hypertension, a major cause of stroke, and 1.25 million Americans have heart attacks every year.
Conquering these diseases requires unwavering national and personal commitment. On the national level, the Federal Government will continue to support research into the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of heart disease. On the personal level, Americans can take steps to prevent heart disease from striking their families, including teaching their children heart-healthy habits. Working together, we can make the tragedy of heart disease a nightmare of the past.
In recognition of the need for all Americans to become involved in the ongoing fight against cardiovascular disease, the Congress, by Joint Resolution approved December 30, 1963 \J1 Stat. 843; 36 U.S.C. 169b), has requested that the President issue an annual proclamation designating February as "American Heart Month."
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim February 1995 as American Heart Month. I invite the Governors of the States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, officials of other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, and the American people to join me in reaffirming our commitment to combating cardiovascular disease and stroke.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of February, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and nineteenth.

Proclamation 6769 of February 10,1995
National Older Workers Employment Week, 1995
By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Today, our Nation relies more than ever on the active involvement of citizens 55 years old or older. It is estimated that more than 70 percent of these Americans work every day to keep our Nation running, contributing to all aspects of our economy and our society. And as our population continues to age, the contributions of older workers will

109 STAT. 1750

PROCLAMATION 6770--FEB. 15, 1995

play an increasingly important role in maintaining America's leadership in a highly competitive international marketplace.
Yet despite often impressive job qualifications, these citizens find that the search for employment becomes more difficult as they grow older. Those seeking to change careers or those struggling to find new jobs are too often confronted by employer reluctance or stereotyping. Rather than being judged on their abilities, older people sometimes face the injustice of being judged solely on their age.
But we Americans understand the meaning of fairness and the value of honest labor. Every reasonable measure of job performance tells us that older workers are at least as effective as younger employees. In many cases, their unique combinations of knowledge, skills, insight, and experience make older Americans even more effective.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim the week of March 12 through March 18, 1995, as "National Older Workers Employment Week." I urge all employers to consider carefully the qualifications of men and women 55 and older and to make use of their talents and expertise. I also encourage public officials responsible for job placement, training, and related services to intensify efforts to help older workers find suitable jobs and training.

National Poison Prevention Week, 1995
By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Children are the future of our country, and protecting them is America's most sacred responsibility. All of us--government leaders, citizens, parents--are bound to do whatever we can to keep them safe and healthy. Simple safety measures--such as using child-resistant packaging correctly, locking cupboards, keeping prescriptions and cleaning supplies out of the reach of a child's hands--all can protect our most precious resource from the dangers of poison and other hazardous substances.
The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has made great progress in safeguarding our young people by mandating child-resistant packaging for medicine and dangerous chemicals. And the invaluable work of the Nation's poison control centers has saved countless lives, both young and old. These public health efforts have reduced childhood poisoning deaths from 450 in 1961 to 62 in 1991.

Pursuant to section 504(f) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2464(f)), I have determined that the per capita gross national product of The Bahamas has exceeded the applicable limit provided for in section 504(f). Accordingly, pursuant to section 504(a) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2464(a)), I have determined that it is appropriate to suspend the designation of The Bahamas as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP, and pursuant to section 504(^ of the Trade Act, I have determined that it is appropriate to terminate such designation.
3. Pursuant to section 504(f) of the Trade Act, I have determined that the per capita gross national product of Israel has exceeded the applicable limit provided for in section 504(f). Accordingly, I have determined that it is appropriate to terminate the designation of Israel as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP.
4. Section 604 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2483) authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) the substance of the provisions of that Act, and of other acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder.

American Heart Month, 1995
By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation
Throughout history, the heart has been a symbol of health and wellbeing. Yet nothing now overshadows Americans' health as much as heart disease--^the leading cause of death among men and women. Diseases of the heart and blood vessels kill nearly a million Americans each year, most from the effects of atherosclerosis, the narrowing and stiffening of blood vessels from the buildup of plaque that usually begins early in life.
Today, Americans are enjoying the rewards of the progress humanity has made in understanding and treating cardiovascular disease. Advances in diagnosis make it possible to see the heart beat without the use of invasive procedures. Thousands of heart attack victims are being saved by the rapid administration of drugs to dissolve blood clots. Soon, gene therapy may be able to prevent the smooth muscle cell multiplication that contributes to the narrowing of blood vessels. Perhaps most important, we have greater understanding of how to prevent

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
America's bounty--^the abundance of the fields, the beauty of the landscape, the richness of our opportunities--^has always attracted people who are in search of a better life for themselves and their children. Our democracy owes its success in great part to the countless immigrants who have made their way to our shores and to the tremendous diversity this Nation has been blessed with since its beginnings.
In March, when communities all across the country celebrate St. Patrick's Day, our Nation honors the rich heritage of the millions of Americans who trace their lineage to Ireland. Coming to this land even before om* Nation was founded, sons and daughters of Erin undertook the perilous journey to make their home in a place of hope and promise. They made inestimable contributions to their new country, both during the struggle for independence and in the founding of the Republic. Nine of the people who signed our Declaration of Independence were of Irish origin, and nineteen Presidents of the United States proudly claim Irish heritage--including our first President, George Washington,
The largest wave of Irish immigrants came in the late 1840s, when the Great Famine ravaging Ireland caused 2 million people to emigrate, mostly to American soil. These immigrants transformed our largest cities and helped to build them into dynamic centers of commerce and industry, and their contributions to our smaller cities and towns are evident today in the cultural, economic, and spiritual makeup of the communities.

For disaster victims here and abroad, for service men and women seeking assistance, and for everyone depending on a safe and ready supply of blood--the Red Cross stands prepared to respond. But the scope of its service extends well beyond the provision of emergency care. Its broader mission is clear: to promote compassion, to foster a spirit of generosity, and to improve the human condition everywhere.
Since Clara Barton--"The Angel of the Battlefield"--founded the American Association of the Red Cross in 1881, its members have been called upon to serve in war and in peace. Today, with more than 1 million dedicated and experienced volunteers, the American Red Cross plays a vital role in bringing physical and emotional comfort to those who need it most. Whether they are responding to an emergency or addressing the daily necessities of the homeless and elderly, Red Cross workers have always been models of community spirit.

Women's History Month, 1995
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Women have made inestimable contributions to our country throughout our Nation's history. Some have names we recognize. Clara Barton. Harriet Tubman. Susan B. Anthony. Eleanor Roosevelt. And Rosa Parks. But women's history is also about the countless women whose names we do not know--the millions of women of courage and commitment who have served this society as doctors and scientists, teachers and factory workers, marathoners and mothers. At home and in schools, in offices and congregations, in our Armed Forces and our communities, women have helped to build this Nation and keep it strong.

The story of women's accomplishments in America is long and proud. Patriots such as Dolly Madison and Harriet Beecher Stowe put their concern for country ahead of their own well-being in order to advance the principles of justice and freedom upon which this Nation was founded. Writers and artists such as Emily Dickinson, Georgia O'Keeffe, and Martha Graham enlivened our culture, extended our horizons, and expanded our appreciation of the world around us. And in recent decades, women have made enormous strides.

these needs. Its commitment to caring for others enables us to restore hope in the Hves of injured citizens, and its example challenges us to revitalize the covenant of American citizenship. The long-term strength of our Nation depends upon our willingness to live out the ideals long embodied by the American Red Cross. To celebrate our past and to safeguard our future, I am proud to commend the countless individuals whose courage and selflessness have sustained this organization for more than a century.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America and Honorary Chairman of the American Red Cross, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 1995 as "American Red Cross Month." I urge all Americans to show support for the more than 2,000 Red Cross chapters nationwide, and I challenge each of you to become active participants in advancing the noble mission of the Red Cross.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-seventh day of February, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two himdred and nineteenth.

Proclamation 6773 of March 1,1995
Women's History Month, 1995
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Women have made inestimable contributions to our country throughout our Nation's history. Some have names we recognize. Clara Barton. Harriet Tubman. Susan B. Anthony. Eleanor Roosevelt. And Rosa Parks. But women's history is also about the countless women whose names we do not know--the millions of women of courage and commitment who have served this society as doctors and scientists, teachers and factory workers, marathoners and mothers. At home and in schools, in offices and congregations, in our Armed Forces and our communities, women have helped to build this Nation and keep it strong. It is in their honor that we pause to celebrate Women's History Month each year.
The story of women's accomplishments in America is long and proud. Patriots such as Dolly Madison and Harriet Beecher Stowe put their concern for country ahead of their own well-being in order to advance the principles of justice and freedom upon which this Nation was founded.

Yet barriers remain. Women now work for pay in greater numbers, in more occupations, and for more years of their lives than ever before, but too many must still settle for compensation far below what it should be, and too many still find their potential curbed by glass ceilings. And women still struggle every day, in tests of resourcefulness and devotion, to balance the demands of work and family. If freedom and opportunity are truly to be the law of the land, we must sustain and renew our commitment to the principle of equality that is our American heritage and work to remove the obstacles that stand in the way.
Women's History Month offers us an opportunity to celebrate the contributions of all of the women who have enriched our Nation. I encourage Americans to learn about women's history--this month and throughout the year. Only by studying the history of America's women--their triumphs and their struggles--can we understand the history of America.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim the month of March 1995 as "Women's History Month." I ask all Americans to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities, and to remember year-round the many and varied contributions that women make each day.

Save Your Vision Week, 1995
By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation
Sight is a precious gift--one that we cannot afford to take for granted. To ensure that we enjoy a healthy view of the world for many years to come, all of us must make certain our eyes receive good care and attention throughout our lives.
Americans can take steps to guard their vision on a daily basis, while at home and on the job. Using face masks, goggles, or safety glasses can protect our eyes from the dangers of potentially harmful chemicals or machinery, and the appropriate protective eyewear is critical while playing sports. But perhaps the easiest and most effective way that we can protect our sight is with comprehensive eye examinations. Early eye tests can help secure good vision for our children from the start. And with regular eye exams, the threat of vision loss does not have to be a normal part of aging.

For Americans at special risk, preventive care takes on added importance. The 14 million individuals nationwide who have diabetes face the possibility of developing diabetic eye diseases, the leading cause of blindness among working-aged Americans. This condition may show no symptoms--even in advanced stages--and it must be detected as soon as possible to prevent vision loss.
Glaucoma, another potentially blinding eye disease, can be controlled when detected early. Approximately 3 million Americans suffer from this disease, which strikes silently, often without pain or noticeable symptoms. Especially at risk are African Americans age 40 and older and all people age 60 and older.
To remind Americans of how they can protect their eyesight, the Congress, by joint resolution approved December 30, 1963 [Jl Stat. 629; 36 U.S.C. 169a), has authorized and requested the President to proclaim the first week in March of each year as "Save Your Vision Week."
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning March 5, 1995, as Save Your Vision Week. I urge all Americans to participate by making eye care and eye safety an important part of their lives. I invite eye care professionals, the media, and all public and private organizations committed to the goals of sight preservation, to join in activities that will make Americans more aware of the steps they can take to preserve their vision.

Each National Park is a classroom without walls, a living laboratory for learning about natural environments, important historical events, and valuable cultural resources that make up our national heritage. To preserve this heritage, the National Park Service works with students and teachers to create exciting learning environments in which to activate a child's interest.
Within each park lies a compelling story--a powerful reminder of our Nation's origins and destiny. Geology, political science, marine ecology, the Civil War, language, art, music, maritime history, geography, wildlife, the American Revolution, technology--all come to life in our National Park System. Today, the men and women of the National Park Service are reaching out to the next generation of caretakers, instilling in our children a respect for the land, an understanding of our common American heritage, and an appreciation of parks as places of inspiration.

Through innovative educational programs, the National Park Service is actively building a new constituency of park supporters who will carry with them the most valued lessons of our country, "Junior Ranger" programs throughout the United States help children understand the wonders of the national parks and the importance of preserving them for years to come. "Parks As Classrooms" links parks with local schools and communities, reaching out to new audiences with handson activities. Residential camping programs open up new worlds of exploration and self-discovery for today's young people, in both inner cities and rural areas. Seminars for teachers assist in encouraging and improving the connections of young people to park areas.

National Park Week, 1995, is a time to celebrate the rich educational tradition of our parks. I encourage all Americans to join me in observing National Park Week as the beginning of a lifetime of learning, appreciating, and acting on behalf of our national treasures. I call on all Americans to learn more about our National Park System and to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies and programs.

National Public Health Week, 1995
By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation
A clean bill of health is one of life's most precious gifts. But for many Americans, and for millions around the world, good health can seem almost a luxury. The AIDS epidemic, the prevalence of poor nutrition, unplanned pregnancies, and environmental degradation--these are just some of the pressing crises facing hardworking public health officials everywhere. While our society's medical technology has advanced to a level unimaginable to the generations before, the crucial job of ensuring basic public health for all remains just beyond our reach.
Now, more than ever, public health programs and services are needed so that we can ensure the best possible health for everyone. Providing safe living and working environments, developing methods to immunize populations against infectious disease, maintaining good nutritional standards, and having good prenatal care for everyone are vital endeavors--and such primary and preventive measures can mean the difference between life and death.
Every day, thousands of individuals across our country are working to build healthy communities, meet the needs of our diverse population.

The Congress, by Public Law 100-307, has called on our citizens to reaffirm annually our dependence on Almighty God by recognizing a "National Day of Prayer."
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 4, 1995, as a National Day of Prayer.

Pursuant to sections 501 and 502 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended ("Trade Act") (19 U.S.C. 2461 and 2462), and having due regard for the eligibility criteria set forth therein, I have determined that it is appropriate to designate the West Bank and Gaza Strip as a beneficiary of the Generalized System of Preferences ("GSP").
2. Section 604 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2483) authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States ("HTS") the substance of the provisions of that Act, and of other acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder.

(3) The extension of the Generalized System of Preferences program to the West Bank and Gaza Strip piu'suant to this proclamation applies only to goods produced in the areas for which arrangements are being established for Palestinian Interim Self-Govemment, as set forth in Articles I, III, and IV of the Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government Arrangements.

Greek Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American Democracy, 1995
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Two thousand five hundred years ago in Athens, across the Peninsula of Attica and throughout Gireece, the idea of democracy was embodied in a series of rights and laws. The resulting freedom for the citizens of that land sparked a period of unprecedented activity in philosophy and the arts. The birth of democracy in Greece signaled the beginning of a lasting cultural transformation clearly reflected in the course of Western civilization.
The United States is proud to acknowledge the debt it owes to the ancient Greeks, whose philosophy and political system guided America's founders in forming a representative democracy on this continent. Yet the common bond that unites our modern nations goes beyond our commitment to the principles of democracy; beyond, too, the close friendship that we share. Through the years, our citizens have demonstrated a willingness to fight for the right to self-determination and for the cause of human dignity. The Greek struggle for independence 174 years ago won the hearts of Americans and all those who love freedom. As we mark the anniversary of that momentous occasion, Americans and Greeks join again in celebration.
Our countries now stand at the dawn of a new era--a time of growing hope and expanding opportunity. Nations across Central Europe are striving to turn from ancient rivalries and to embrace the possibility of democratic, market-oriented change. The Greek dedication to independence can provide both an important example and a helping hand for its neighbors, and Greece's recent efforts to strengthen these ties can serve to foster stability and prosperity throughout the region. Today, as ever, the United States supports Greece in its call for fellowship and peace. We stand together in affirming that the blessings of democracy will long survive and flourish.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 25, 1995, as "Greek Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of

National Day of Prayer, 1995
By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation
Our Nation was built on the steadfast foundation of the prayers of our ancestors. In times of blessing and crisis, stability and change, thanksgiving and repentance, appeals for Divine direction have helped the citizens of the United States to remain faithful to our long-standing commitment to life, liberty, and justice for all.
This reliance on spiritual assistance has especially characterized times of national transition and uncertainty. As our country was ravaged by the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln remarked, "I have been driven many times upon my knees by the overwhelming conviction that I had nowhere else to go." And with him, millions of slaves cried out to the Almighty for an end to their suffering.
Abolitionist Frederick Douglass said this about the spiritual songs sung on the plantations: "Every tone was a testimony against slavery, and a prayer to God for deliverance from chains." Since that time, we have witnessed tremendous improvements in relations between people of all races and backgrounds. Indeed, long ago, through the work of prayer and common effort, and with the inspiration of the Creator, we began to turn the tide in this Nation from divisiveness and recrimination toward reconciliation and healing.
Let us not forget those painful lessons of our past, but continue to seek the guidance of God in all the affairs of our Nation. We must not become complacent, but rather press onward for the protection of the vulnerable and the downtrodden. In the words of President Lincoln, "it behooves us then to humble ourselves before the offended Power, to confess our national sins and pray for clemency and forgiveness" for

Proclamation 6779 of March 23,1995
Greek Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American Democracy, 1995
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Two thousand five hundred years ago in Athens, across the Peninsula of Attica and throughout Gireece, the idea of democracy was embodied in a series of rights and laws. The resulting freedom for the citizens of that land sparked a period of unprecedented activity in philosophy and the arts. The birth of democracy in Greece signaled the beginning of a lasting cultural transformation clearly reflected in the course of Western civilization.
The United States is proud to acknowledge the debt it owes to the ancient Greeks, whose philosophy and political system guided America's founders in forming a representative democracy on this continent. Yet the common bond that unites our modern nations goes beyond our commitment to the principles of democracy; beyond, too, the close friendship that we share. Through the years, our citizens have demonstrated a willingness to fight for the right to self-determination and for the cause of human dignity. The Greek struggle for independence 174 years ago won the hearts of Americans and all those who love freedom. As we mark the anniversary of that momentous occasion, Americans and Greeks join again in celebration.
Our countries now stand at the dawn of a new era--a time of growing hope and expanding opportunity. Nations across Central Europe are striving to turn from ancient rivalries and to embrace the possibility of democratic, market-oriented change. The Greek dedication to independence can provide both an important example and a helping hand for its neighbors, and Greece's recent efforts to strengthen these ties can serve to foster stability and prosperity throughout the region. Today, as ever, the United States supports Greece in its call for fellowship and peace. We stand together in affirming that the blessings of democracy will long survive and flourish.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 25, 1995, as "Greek Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of

109 STAT. 1760

PROCLAMATION 6780--MAR. 23, 1995

Greek and American Democracy." I call upon all Americans to observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentythird day of March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and nineteenth.

Proclamation 6782 of April 6,1995
National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day, 1995
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
In the centuries since our Nation was founded, our citizens have been called on time and again to defend the blessiiigs of American democracy. Although the enemies of freedom have often risen from distant shores, the valiant men and women who wear our Nation's imiform have made freedom's fight their own. From Europe to the Pacific, Korea to the Persian Gulf, these Americans and their families have suffered through the darkest hours of humanity so that the cause of human dignity might endure.
It is in gratitude that we pause each year to recall the courage and to honor the service of the sons and daughters of America who have been held as prisoners of war. Few words can express the depth of their sacrifice or the worthiness of their mission. Often subjected to extreme brutality in violation of international codes and customs governing their treatment, many of our people have come home with disabling wounds and injuries. Too many of our people have not come home at all
Today, the lives of these extraordinary Americans and the stories of their indomitable spirits are at the core of our national character. The citizens of the United States will always remember the proud individuals who traded their liberty to preserve our own. We will build on the triumphs of democracy that they have helped to ensure. And in speaking of their bravery, we will tell our children and grandchildren that though bodies may be imprisoned, hearts can remain ever free.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 9, 1995, as "National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day." I urge State and local officials, private organizations, and U.S. citizens everywhere to join in honoring the members of the United States Armed Forces who have been held as prisoners of war. I call upon all Americans to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and nineteenth.

Proclamation 6783 of April 7, 1995

Cancer Control Month, 1995

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Almost all of us have been touched by the devastating effects of cancer. In its many forms, cancer has been one of the most persistent and deadly health problems of this century. With the coming of spring-- a time of rebirth--it is especially appropriate for us to renew our commitment to fighting cancer, to take pride in the progress we have made in combatting this disease, and to recognize the work still to be done.
In the 24 years since the signing of the National Cancer Act, we have made significant strides against cancer. Through diligent research, we have identified major risk factors for the disease--including diet, lack of exercise, and smoking--and we have worked to educate Americans to minimize these risks in their lives. New approaches to treatment have been developed in recent years, and new medicines are continually being refined and tested.
Among women in the United States who develop cancer, lung cancer claims the most lives, followed closely by breast cancer. An estimated 1 in 8 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer at some point in their lives--^up from 1 in 20 just two decades ago. In this decade, an estimated 2 million women will be diagnosed with breast cancer or cervical cancer, with more than 500,000 of these women dying as a result. Cancers of the uterus, ovaries, and colon are also on the rise among women in this country.
We are making progress, however. For example, from 1989 to 1992, the numbers of women dying from breast cancer actually declined--the largest short-term decrease since 1950. With the advances in treatment upon early detection, screening mammography has never been more important. My Administration is launching a nationwide campaign to increase awareness of Medicare coverage for screening mammography. Additionally, most States now have laws requiring private insurers to offer coverage for biannual screening mammography, and third-party reimbursement is increasing. Together, these measures are helping more women to benefit from this potentially life-saving procedure.
Remarkable progress has also been made against childhood cancers as a result of the unflagging persistence of researchers in laboratories and hospitals across the country. Although the number of children affected by cancer is increasing, the number of deaths from childhood cancer continues to drop dramatically. Improved diagnostic and prognostic techniques and important advances in treatment have given renewed hope to children with leukemia, Wilms' tumor, neuroblastoma, and brain tumors. We are seeing a steady increase in the number of adult survivors of these childhood cancers.
Every one of us has a part to play in the fight against this disease and much work remains to eradicate it. Continuing research is essential to reducing the incidence of cancer for all our citizens.
In 1938, the Congress of the United States passed a joint resolution requesting the President to issue an annual proclamation declaring April as "Cancer Control Month."

PROCLAMATION 6784--APR. 10, 1995

NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the month of April 1995 as Cancer Control Month. I invite the Governors of the 50 States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Mayor of the District of Columbia, and the appropriate officials of all other areas under the American flag to issue similar proclamations. I also ask health care professionals, private industry, community groups, insurance companies, and all other interested organizations and individual citizens to unite in support of our Nation's determined efforts to control cancer.

Proclamation 6784 of April 10,1995
Pan American Day and Pan American Week, 1995
By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation
The peoples of the Americas today live in a world of great promise. Fundamental democratic principles, such as the rule of law and free and fair elections, are being embraced throughout the hemisphere. In perhaps one of the most eloquent expressions of the commitment of American nations to democratic rule, Jean Bertrand Aristide was restored to his elected position as President of Haiti. Open markets work, democratic governments are just--and together they offer the best hope for improving the quality of life for all of us.
As we celebrate Pan American Day, 1995, we recognize that the nations of the Western Hemisphere are interdependent, and our futures are intertwined. We are bound together by our shared commitment to democracy, human rights, market economics, and effective governance. These common ideals have enabled us to form an extraordinary network of cooperation, encompassing endeavors from trade and environmental protection to science and technology.
The countries of the Americas have taken important steps to open their economies, create new jobs, and expand opportunities for their citizens. These reforms represent a historic break with the past and begin to pave the road toward higher standards of living in the 21st century. The North American Free Trade Agreement marks an additional milestone on the way to the hemispheric free trade agreement envisioned at the Summit of the Americas.
At that summit in December of this past year, the 34 democratically elected leaders of the hemisphere determined to make our governments more effective, our economic growth more sustainable, and our environments safer and healthier. Our deliberations there were guided by a vital spirit of cooperation, and we continue to move forward today with the knowledge that, now more than ever, the economic prosperity of each of our countries depends on the progress of our neighbors.

Proclamation 6781 of April 4, 1995

National Child Abuse Prevention Month, 1995

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Childhood should be a special time. Every child should grow up in an atmosphere of love and respect. Children should have a chance to learn, to explore and develop, to look forward to becoming successful, happy, and loving adults. Yet tragically, for a growing number of children in the United States, childhood is an ordeal of violence, pain, and broken promises-a time to endure, not one to cherish.
Child abuse and neglect in America are on the rise. Nationwide, nearly 3 million children are reported abused and neglected each year, and more than 1,200 die from the effects. Although public concern about violence against our Nation's youth is extremely high, many Americans don't know what role they can play in protecting them. For that reason, each April, communities across the country join together to raise public awareness, to call for an end to child abuse, and to let everyone know what they can do to help.
This year. National Child Abuse Prevention Month focuses on the simple truth, "The more you help, the less they hurt." The goal is to teach all Americans how they can help end the cycle of abuse and neglect that tears at the very fabric of our families, our communities, and our country. Because the effects of child abuse are felt by whole communities, the search for solutions must be a community-wide effort--and every citizen must get involved.
Child abuse prevention efforts succeed because of partnerships among social service agencies, schools, religious organizations, law enforcement agencies, and the business community. I encourage you to get involved. Volunteer on a crisis hotline for parents who are under stress, or help start a parents' support group. Perhaps you could find space in your community to establish a "drop-in center" where parents can get information and support. You could urge your religious or neighborhood group to sponsor a home visitor program for new parents. Or you might help your local school and youth organizations arrange for speakers and events about preventing violence against children.
These are just some of the steps we can take to help protect our children and to strengthen our families. If we don't change things, our children--more of them each day--will lose their chance at life. And our Nation will lose the tremendous potential that every young life holds.
America's children are products of the world we have made for them. Their well-being is a reflection of our commitment, maturity, and wisdom. If we nurture our children and fill their lives with genuine caring and respect, we will see our love realized in a world of enduring hope and promise,
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON. President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the LJnited States, do hereby proclaim the month of April 1995 as "National Child Abuse Prevention Month," I call upon

109 STAT. 1770

all Americans during this month and throughout the year to help keep our children safe from harm.

Proclamation 6782 of April 6,1995
National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day, 1995
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
In the centuries since our Nation was founded, our citizens have been called on time and again to defend the blessiiigs of American democracy. Although the enemies of freedom have often risen from distant shores, the valiant men and women who wear our Nation's imiform have made freedom's fight their own. From Europe to the Pacific, Korea to the Persian Gulf, these Americans and their families have suffered through the darkest hours of humanity so that the cause of human dignity might endure.
It is in gratitude that we pause each year to recall the courage and to honor the service of the sons and daughters of America who have been held as prisoners of war. Few words can express the depth of their sacrifice or the worthiness of their mission. Often subjected to extreme brutality in violation of international codes and customs governing their treatment, many of our people have come home with disabling wounds and injuries. Too many of our people have not come home at all
Today, the lives of these extraordinary Americans and the stories of their indomitable spirits are at the core of our national character. The citizens of the United States will always remember the proud individuals who traded their liberty to preserve our own. We will build on the triumphs of democracy that they have helped to ensure. And in speaking of their bravery, we will tell our children and grandchildren that though bodies may be imprisoned, hearts can remain ever free.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 9, 1995, as "National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day." I urge State and local officials, private organizations, and U.S. citizens everywhere to join in honoring the members of the United States Armed Forces who have been held as prisoners of war. I call upon all Americans to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and nineteenth.

WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 6780 of March 23,1995
To Implement Certain Provisions of Trade Agreements Resulting From the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations, and for Other Purposes
By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation
1. On April 15, 1994,1 entered into trade agreements resulting from the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations ("the Uruguay Round Agreements"). In section 101(a) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act ("the URAA") (Public Law 103-465; 108 Stat. 4814) (19 U.S.C. 3511(a)), the Congress approved the Uruguay Round Trade Agreements listed in section 101(d) of that Act.
2. Pursuant to section 101(b) of the URAA, I decided to accept the Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization ("the WTO Agreement") on behalf of the United States, and I determined that the WTO Agreement entered into force for the United States on January 1, 1995.
3. (a) Sections 1102(a) and (e) of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, as amended ("the 1988 Act") (19 U.S.C. 2902(a) and (e)), authorize the President to proclaim such modification or continuance of any existing duty, such continuance of existing duty-free or excise treatment, or such additional duties, as he determines to be required or appropriate to carry out any trade agreement entered into under these sections.
(b) Section 111(a) of the URAA (19 U.S.C. 3521(a)) authorizes the President to proclaim such other modification of any duty, such other staged rate reduction, or such other additional duties beyond those authorized by section 1102 of the 1988 Act (19 U.S.C. 2902) as the President determines to be necessary or appropriate to carry out Schedule XX--United Statesof America, annexed to the Marrakesh Protocol to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 ("Schedule XX").
(c) Section 103(a) of the URAA (19 U.S.C. 3513(a)) authorizes the President to proclaim such actions as may be necessary to ensure that any provision or amendment made by the URAA that takes effect on the date that any of the Uruguay Round Agreements enters into force with respect to the United States is appropriately implemented on such date.
4. Proclamation 6763 of December 23, 1994, implemented the Uruguay Round Agreements, including Schedule XX, with respect to the United

PROCLAMATION 6780--MAR. 23, 1995

109 STAT. 1761

States; and incorporated in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States ("the HTS") tariff modifications necessary and appropriate to carry out the Uruguay Round Agreements and certain conforming changes in rules of origin for the North American Free Trade Agreement ("NAFTA"). Certain technical errors, including inadvertent omissions, were made in that proclamation. I have determined that it is necessary, to reflect accurately the intended tariff treatment provided for in the Uruguay Round Agreements and to ensure the continuation of the agreed NAFTA rules of origin, to modify certain provisions of the HTS, as set forth in the Annex to this proclamation.
5. (a) One of the Uruguay Round Agreements approved by the Congress in sections 101(a) and 101(d) of the URAA (19 U.S.C. 3511(a) and (d)) is the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights ("the TRIPs Agreement").
(b) Section 104A of title 17, United States Code, as amended by section 514 of the URAA, provides for copyright protection in restored works. Section 104A(h), as amended, provides that the date of restoration of a restored copyright shall be the date on which the TRIPs Agreement enters into forcewith respect to the United States, if the source country is a nation adhering to the Berne Convention or a World Trade Organization (WTO) member on such date.
(c) Article 65, paragraph 1, of the TRIPs Agreement provides that no WTO member shall be obliged to apply the provisions of this Agreement until one year after the date of entry into force of the WTO Agreement. The date of entry into force of the WTO Agreement with respect to the United States was January 1, 1995.
(d) The statement of administrative action, approved by the Congress in section 101(a)(2) of the URAA (19 U.S.C. 3511(a)(2)), provides that, "in general, copyright will be restored on the date when the TRIPs Agreement's obligations take effect for the United States."
(e) Accordingly, I have decided that it is necessary and appropriate, in order to implement the TRIPs Agreement and to ensure that section 514 of the URAA is appropriately implemented, to proclaim that the date on which the obligations of the TRIPs Agreement will take effect for the United States is January 1, 1996.
6. (a) Section 902(a)(2) of title 17, United States Code, authorizes the President to extend protection under chapter 9 of title 17, United States Code, to mask works of owners who are nationals, domiciliaries, or sovereign authorities of, and to mask works, which are first commercially exploited in, a foreign nation that grants United States mask work owners substantially the same protection that it grants its own nationals and domiciliaries, or that grants protection to such works on substantially the same basis as does chapter 9 of title 17, United States Code.
(b) Australia, Canada, Japan, Switzerland, and the Member States of the European Community provide adequate and effective protection for mask works within the meaning of 17 U.S.C. 902(a)(2), and have been subject to interim protection under 17 U.S.C. 914. Consequently, I find that these countries satisfy the requirements of 17 U.S.C. 902(a)(2), and are to be extended full protection under chapter 9 of title 17, United States Code, effective on July 1, 1995.

109 STAT. 1762

PROCLAMATION 6780--MAR. 23, 1995

(c) In addition, 17 U.S.C. 902(a)(l){A)(ii) provides that mask work owners who are nationals, domiciliaries, or sovereign authorities of a foreign nation that is a party to a treaty affording protection to mask works to which the United States is also a party are eligible for protection imder chapter 9 of title 17, United States Code. The TRIPs Agreement, which requires all WTO members to provide protection equivalent to that provided under chapter 9 of title 17 on the basis of national treatment, is such an agreement. Because the United States is a member of the WTO and thus of the TRIPs Agreement, and because the TRIPs Agreement will be effective for the United States on January 1, 1996, all other WTO members will become eligible for full protection under chapter 9 of title 17, United States Code, on January 1, 1996.
7. Section 491 of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979, as amended ("the 1979 Act") (19 U.S.C. 2578). requires the President to designate an agency to be responsible for informing the public of the sanitary and phytosanitary standard-setting activities of each international standardsetting organization. I have decided to designate the Department of Agriculture as the agency responsible for providing the public with this information.
8. (a) The March 24, 1994, Memorandum of Understanding on the Results of the Uruguay Round Market Access Negotiations on Agriculture Between the United States of America and Argentina ("the MOU"), submitted to the Congress along with the Uruguay Round Agreements, provides for "an appropriate certificate of origin" for imports of peanuts and peanut butter and peanut paste from Argentina.
(b) Proclamation 6763 proclaimed the Schedule XX tariff rate quotas for peanuts and peanut butter and peanut paste. However, that proclamation did not specify which agency should implement the MOU.
(c) Section 404 of the URAA (19 U.S.C. 3601) requires the President to take such action as may be necessary to ensure that imports of agricultural products do not disrupt the orderly marketing of commodities in the United States.
(d) Accordingly, I have decided to delegate to the United States Trade Representative ("the USTR") my authority under section 404 of the URAA to implement the MOU, through such regulations as the USTR, or, at the direction of the USTR, other appropriate agencies, may issue.
9. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483) ("the 1974 Act"), authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the substance of the relevant provisions of that Act, of other Acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including but not limited to section 301 of title 3, United States Code, section 902(a)(1) and (2) of title 17, United States Code, section 604 of the 1974 Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), section 491 of the 1979 Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2578), section 1102 of the 1988 Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2902), title I of the URAA (19 U.S.C. 3511-3551), and section 404 of the URAA (19 U.S.C. 3601), do hereby proclaim that:

PROCLAMATION 6780--MAR. 23, 1995

109 STAT. 1763

(1) To more completely implement the tariff treatment accorded under the Uruguay Round Agreements, the HTS is modified as set forth in the Annex to this proclamation.
(2) The obligations of the TRIPs Agreement shall enter into force for the United States on January 1, 1996.

I invite the Governors of the 50 States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Mayor of the District of Columbia, and the appropriate officials of all other areas under the American flag to issue similar proclamations. I also ask health care professionals, private industry, community groups, insurance companies, and all other interested organizations and individual citizens to unite in support of our Nation's determined efforts to control cancer.

Proclamation 6784 of April 10,1995
Pan American Day and Pan American Week, 1995
By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation
The peoples of the Americas today live in a world of great promise. Fundamental democratic principles, such as the rule of law and free and fair elections, are being embraced throughout the hemisphere. In perhaps one of the most eloquent expressions of the commitment of American nations to democratic rule, Jean Bertrand Aristide was restored to his elected position as President of Haiti. Open markets work, democratic governments are just--and together they offer the best hope for improving the quality of life for all of us.
As we celebrate Pan American Day, 1995, we recognize that the nations of the Western Hemisphere are interdependent, and our futures are intertwined. We are bound together by our shared commitment to democracy, human rights, market economics, and effective governance. These common ideals have enabled us to form an extraordinary network of cooperation, encompassing endeavors from trade and environmental protection to science and technology.
The countries of the Americas have taken important steps to open their economies, create new jobs, and expand opportunities for their citizens. These reforms represent a historic break with the past and begin to pave the road toward higher standards of living in the 21st century. The North American Free Trade Agreement marks an additional milestone on the way to the hemispheric free trade agreement envisioned at the Summit of the Americas.
At that summit in December of this past year, the 34 democratically elected leaders of the hemisphere determined to make our governments more effective, our economic growth more sustainable, and our environments safer and healthier. Our deliberations there were guided by a vital spirit of cooperation, and we continue to move forward today with the knowledge that, now more than ever, the economic prosperity of each of our countries depends on the progress of our neighbors.

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
As we move toward a complex and challenging new century, excellence in American education is more vital to our Nation's success than ever. We live in an era when advances in science and technology create new questions and demand more of our citizens each day. Only a national commitment to high-quality education can prepare our young people to meet the great responsibilities and opportunities of the future.
Yet an education that prepares a child for a lifetime is more than an accumulation of facts or single-minded preparation for a career. It is also a set of ideals and ethics that unites all Americans and allows us to work together for a just and honorable society. Teachers, families, and communities play vital roles in passing on these shared values and common hopes for a better tomorrow.
Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the Lubavitcher Rebbe, well understood the importance of nurturing the heart along with the mind. Throughout his long and rich life, he believed that the education of our young people would only be successful if it sought to build character as well as intellect, if it taught the lessons of honesty, tolerance, and good citizenship, as well as language, math, and science.
This year, let us rededicate ourselves to teaching the love of learning that was championed by Rabbi Schneerson and is strengthened by caring leaders like him throughout our Nation. As we provide our students with the information and practical tools they need, let us also pass on to them the capacity for understanding that can help to give fuller meaning to their lives.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 11, 1995, as "Education and Sharing Day, U.S.A." I call upon Government officials, educators, volunteers, and all the people of the United States

Today, people everywhere recognize that empowering kids and teens with sound advice is important, but it is not enough.

Jewish Heritage Week, 1995
By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation
Throughout history and through times of profound adversity, the Jewish people have built their lives on the strength of family and the spirit of community. Millions have made a home in America--a Nation filled with opportunity and blessed with the miracle of freedom. And here, with hard work and dedication, the Jewish-American community has flourished.
Jewish citizens have made vital contributions to every sector of our society. From academia to the arts, from business to government, from the smallest towns to the largest cities, Jewish Americans have infused our Nation with a powerful faith, a commitment to family and community, and a devotion to scholarship and self-improvement.
Judaism is a unique gift to this land that people of myriad faiths and cultures call home. The ancient commandment of tzedakah--charity-- challenges us to embrace the duty of service to others. The Talmudic teachings of mercy and justice, and those who have sought to uphold these ideals, grace the pages of American history. We can draw strength and inspiration from the enduring lessons of Judaism, and it is entirely fitting that we honor the great traditions of its followers.

National Volunteer Week, 1995

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Our ancestors built this Nation on the spirit of independence and the strength of community. Yesterday's Americans came together to raise a bam, till a farm, or teach a child to write. They came together to care for one another and to lift up their neighbors in need. For rich and poor, old and young, giving their talents to benefit the community was the most fundamental responsibility of American citizenship.
Through the years, this basic ideal has endured. Service remains the noblest quality of the American character. Our people still come together to build a house, plant a garden, or tutor a child. Elementary school students help older Americans in their daily lives. Seniors help struggling teenagers stay out of trouble. Countless dedicated citizens claim our country's challenges as their own. Their service sets a powerful example of leadership and compassion for each of us to follow.
As a partner in progress, government can expand and strengthen this great American legacy. AmeriCorps, the Senior Corps, and Learn and Serve America now provide service opportunities for more than a million of our citizens. These initiatives enable us to keep faith with the covenant of citizenship. This week, we celebrate the tens of millions of volunteers who give their time, their energy, and their hearts to making our world a better place.
We are indeed fortunate that, even as we face difficult problems in our streets, schools, homes, and commimities, citizens are volunteering to help one another in niunerous ways. Some spend a few hours every week. Others give entire days--even years--of their lives to service. Each makes a lasting contribution to the substance and the spirit of community in America. And each helps lead us into an ever brighter future.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 23 through April 29, 1995, as "National Volunteer Week." I call upon all Americans to observe this week with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities in expression of their commitment.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and nineteenth.

National Day of Mourning in Memory of Those Who Died in Oklahoma City
By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation
As we seek justice for the evil done in Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995, good and decent people everywhere mourn the loss of innocents. Our sons and daughters, parents and friends were stolen from us. Their families can never replace the gift of their laughter. Our Nation can never replace the spirit of their character. But even as we grieve, we resolve today in solemn promise that those on earth shall never be bowed by murderous cowards. This sin against humanity shall not go unpunished.
It has been said that, "In every child who is born, the potentiality of the whole human race is born again." We lost unimaginable potential this past week. And we will miss our loved ones dearly. But the children who died in this violence may yet lift up humanity. We do them no greater honor than by taking from their deaths the memory of their hopes, by carrying with us always their dreams, their kind and trusting ways. We redeem the value of their lives no further than by heeding the voices of children everywhere, who ask simply and invariably for peace and love.
We take comfort in knowing that all who perished are in God's hands.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby appoint Sunday, April 23, 1995, as a National Day of Mourning throughout the United States. I ask the American people assembled on that day in their homes and places of worship to pay homage to the memory of those lost in the Oklahoma City tragedy and to pray for them and their community. I invite all those around the world who share our grief to join us in this solemn observance.

Proclamation 6792 of April 27,1995
Law Day, U.S.A., 1995
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Our legal system is the foundation on which this Nation was built. It enables us to realize the promises of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Law protects our homes, our families, and our communities. It secures our borders and safeguards our environment. It is the basis for free markets and our continued prosperity. And it helps guide our relationships with other lands.
When President John F. Kennedy proclaimed Law Day, U.S.A. in 1962, he reminded us that law, like freedom, demands constant vigilance. We must nurture "through education and example an appreciation of the values of oiu- system of justice and . . . an increased respect for law and for the rights of others as basic elements of our free society." As we celebrate Law Day this year, it is more important than ever that we rededicate ourselves to reaching these goals.
Today, America's system of jurisprudence is being challenged as never before. Great technological advances are leading us to redefine and expand the ways in which laws apply to us as individuals and as a Nation. From communications to computer software, international trade to environmental protection, our legal system remains an anchor of freedom, even as it evolves to meet the demands of our rapidly changing times.
If we are to further advance the causes of democracy and human dignity around the world, we must not falter in enforcing the rule of law here at home. Laws must be applied as vigorously on Main Street as on the information superhighway. The legal community must help to restore Americans' sense of security and faith in justice. Most important, our laws must continue to fulfill our Founders' ideals of fairness and equality. Working together, we must strive to ensure that tomorrow's generations inherit the truths that have long sustained us as a people and move our Nation forward.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, in accordance with Public Law 87-20 of April 7, 1961, do hereby proclaim May 1, 1995, as "Law Day, U.S.A." I urge the people of the United States to use this occasion to reflect on our heritage of freedom, to familiarize themselves with their rights and responsibilities, and to aid others seeking to affirm their rights under law.
I call upon the legal profession, civic associations, educators, librarians, public officials, and the media to promote the observance of this

Proclamation 6793 of April 28,1995
Small Business Week, 1995
By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation
At the heart of our free enterprise system are the Nation's 21,5 million small businesses. They are the engine of our economy, keeping America competitive in domestic and global markets. These businesses demonstrate by their achievements and success that the promise of the American Dream is within the grasp of every one of our citizens.
America's small business entrepreneurs are risk-takers, venturing into new and often uncertain territory. As a Nation, we are indebted to these bold men and women. With unparalleled commitment and determination, they keep us at the forefront of innovation and help fuel our economy.
During the past decade, more than 600,000 new firms have been created annually. Indeed, just last year, more small businesses were created than at any time in our country's history. Through much of this period, small businesses generated most of the Nation's new jobs. Today, they employ almost 60 percent of the country's private work force.
Growing numbers of women and minorities are empowering themselves through small business ownership, taking risks, and pursuing their entrepreneurial ambitions. New programs are teaching business ownership skills to our youth. And our Administration's Reinventing Government initiative--^building a government that works better and costs less--^will help sustain this entrepreneurial spirit for generations to come.
As we approach a new era of economic opportunity, our Nation's small business owners continue to inspire us by their example. On behalf of all Americans, I thank these hardworking citizens across the country for helping to keep the American Dream alive.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 30 through May 6, 1995, as "Small Business Week." I ask all Americans to join me in saluting the small business owners of our Nation during this week with appropriate events and ceremonies.

Proclamation 6791 of April 26,1995

National Crime Victims' Rights Week, 1995

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Every year, more than 36 million people in America become the victims of crime. Offenders prey on our daughters and sons, sisters and brothers, parents, grandparents, and friends. Violent crime is creating fear and insecurity in communities across our Nation.
To ensure justice and promote healing, a grassroots crime victims' movement has worked to enact numerous initiatives in State legislatures across the country--laws that now provide crucial rights for crime victims and their families. As we mark National Crime Victims' Rights Week this year, Americans join in remembering the fallen, in celebrating criminal justice reforms, and in envisioning a future free from violence.
The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, which I signed into law this past September, ensures that our criminal justice system recognizes the victims. Its provisions include allocution rights for victims of violent crime and sexual abuse, truth in sentencing guidelines to ensure that violent offenders serve longer sentences, and sex offender registries designed to monitor offenders more effectively. This Act will help put 100,000 more police officers on the streets of our communities. And the landmark Violence Against Women Act is the first comprehensive Federal effort to address violence against women.
But no government can be truly effective without the active involvement of its citizens. Victim advocacy--the work of the more than 8,000 organizations and the countless individuals we honor this week--can be a lifeline to emotional survival. When random bullets wound a child, when a battered woman needs shelter in the night, when a rape survivor seeks help--victim advocates are there to comfort and support. Many of our Nation's crime victims and advocates work tirelessly in schools, neighborhoods, and youth custody facilities. They give faces and names to the statistics of crime, opening young peoples' eyes to the reality of violence and helping to plant seeds of responsibility that can last a lifetime.
We nonetheless recognize that much remains to be done. But with continued partnerships between every level of government, criminal justice and victim advocacy organizations, and crime survivors and their families, America can begin to replace the nightmare of crime with a bright new day of hope.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 23 through April 29, 1995, as "National Crime Victims' Rights Week." I urge all Americans to pause and remember the victims of crime and to join in honoring those who serve crime victims and their families by working to reduce violence, to assist those harmed by crime, and to make our homes and communities safer places in which to live.

Proclamation 6792 of April 27,1995
Law Day, U.S.A., 1995
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Our legal system is the foundation on which this Nation was built. It enables us to realize the promises of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Law protects our homes, our families, and our communities. It secures our borders and safeguards our environment. It is the basis for free markets and our continued prosperity. And it helps guide our relationships with other lands.
When President John F. Kennedy proclaimed Law Day, U.S.A. in 1962, he reminded us that law, like freedom, demands constant vigilance. We must nurture "through education and example an appreciation of the values of oiu- system of justice and . . . an increased respect for law and for the rights of others as basic elements of our free society." As we celebrate Law Day this year, it is more important than ever that we rededicate ourselves to reaching these goals.
Today, America's system of jurisprudence is being challenged as never before. Great technological advances are leading us to redefine and expand the ways in which laws apply to us as individuals and as a Nation. From communications to computer software, international trade to environmental protection, our legal system remains an anchor of freedom, even as it evolves to meet the demands of our rapidly changing times.
If we are to further advance the causes of democracy and human dignity around the world, we must not falter in enforcing the rule of law here at home. Laws must be applied as vigorously on Main Street as on the information superhighway. The legal community must help to restore Americans' sense of security and faith in justice. Most important, our laws must continue to fulfill our Founders' ideals of fairness and equality. Working together, we must strive to ensure that tomorrow's generations inherit the truths that have long sustained us as a people and move our Nation forward.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, in accordance with Public Law 87-20 of April 7, 1961, do hereby proclaim May 1, 1995, as "Law Day, U.S.A." I urge the people of the United States to use this occasion to reflect on our heritage of freedom, to familiarize themselves with their rights and responsibilities, and to aid others seeking to affirm their rights under law.
I call upon the legal profession, civic associations, educators, librarians, public officials, and the media to promote the observance of this

109 STAT. 1780

PROCLAMATION 6793--APR. 28, 1995

day through appropriate programs and activities. I also call upon public officials to display the flag of the United States on all government buildings throughout the day.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-seventh day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and nineteenth.

Proclamation 6793 of April 28,1995
Small Business Week, 1995
By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation
At the heart of our free enterprise system are the Nation's 21,5 million small businesses. They are the engine of our economy, keeping America competitive in domestic and global markets. These businesses demonstrate by their achievements and success that the promise of the American Dream is within the grasp of every one of our citizens.
America's small business entrepreneurs are risk-takers, venturing into new and often uncertain territory. As a Nation, we are indebted to these bold men and women. With unparalleled commitment and determination, they keep us at the forefront of innovation and help fuel our economy.
During the past decade, more than 600,000 new firms have been created annually. Indeed, just last year, more small businesses were created than at any time in our country's history. Through much of this period, small businesses generated most of the Nation's new jobs. Today, they employ almost 60 percent of the country's private work force.
Growing numbers of women and minorities are empowering themselves through small business ownership, taking risks, and pursuing their entrepreneurial ambitions. New programs are teaching business ownership skills to our youth. And our Administration's Reinventing Government initiative--^building a government that works better and costs less--^will help sustain this entrepreneurial spirit for generations to come.
As we approach a new era of economic opportunity, our Nation's small business owners continue to inspire us by their example. On behalf of all Americans, I thank these hardworking citizens across the country for helping to keep the American Dream alive.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 30 through May 6, 1995, as "Small Business Week." I ask all Americans to join me in saluting the small business owners of our Nation during this week with appropriate events and ceremonies.

Proclamation 6794 of April 29,1995
Loyalty Day, 1995
By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation
Our country's rich diversity of peoples and cultures has been called "the noble experiment." From its beginnings, our great democracy has guaranteed its citizens the blessings of freedom and the right of selfdetermination. Each year, with the coming of spring and the rebirth of nature, we pause to consider the progress of our Nation and to reaffirm our allegiance to the American experiment.
Two hundred and twenty years ago in Lexington, Massachusetts, a ragged group of colonial Americans faced a column of British soldiers. As the smoke cleared from the "shot heard round the world," eight American "Minutemen" lay dead-their blood spilled along the path to a new Nation on this soil. Their gift of freedom is held sacred to this day.
All Americans can be proud of the heritage of courage and sacrifice that has extended unbroken through generations of our citizens. The success of the United States today is seen both in our continued prosperity and strength and in our role as an international beacon of liberty. As we recall those who gave their lives for our freedom, we see our Nation's history reflected in their ranks-from the tireless "Minutemen" in Lexington to the brave men and women who fought in the Persian Gulf. These fine citizens, along with their families and those who have served on the home front, deserve our profound respect and gratitude. Let history forever record our loyalty to their legacy.
The Congress, by Public Law 85-529, has designated May 1 of each year as "Loyalty Day." We spend this day in celebration of our Constitution and our precious Bill of Rights and in honor of the sacrifices that have enabled this great charter to endure.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 1, 1995, as Loyalty Day. I call upon all Americans to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities, including public recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag of the United States, I also call upon government officials to display the flag on all government buildings and grounds on this day.

Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month, 1995

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Like so many people of this Nation, Americans of Asian and Pacific ancestry enjoy dual heritage-the great cultures of the lands of their forebearers and the rich traditions of liberty and equality cherished by the United States. Bringing new values and customs to these shores, Asian and Pacific Americans have immeasurably enriched the quality and character of this country. In every field of endeavor, in public and private sector alike, they have endowed our Nation with unparalleled energy and vision.
We owe a debt of gratitude to these Americans, both for the gift of their talents and for helping us build bridges of understanding to their ancestral lands in the Pacific Community--^bridges that help our economies to grow and that widen the path to peace.
Today, our Nation stands at the dawn of a new era of hope and opportunity. We depend as never before on the active involvement of every one of our people to meet the challenges of our changing world. With the strength of our diversity and a continued commitment to the ideal of freedom, all Americans will share in the blessings of the bright future that awaits us.
To honor the achievements of Asian/Pacific Americans and to recognize their many contributions to our Nation, the Congress, by Public Law 102-450, has designated the month of May as "Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month."
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 1995, as Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this occasion with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities,
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and nineteenth.

Proclamation 6796 of May 3,1995
Older Americans Month, 1995
By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Throughout its history, our Nation has benefited immeasurably from the myriad contributions of its older Americans. Our democracy owes its success in great part to the millions of senior citizens who through their work, their volunteer efforts, and their devotion to their families and communities have helped build the foundation of this country.

PROCLAMATION 6797--MAY 11, 1995

109 STAT. 1783

Each year, America reserves the month of May to pay tribute to the contributions and sacrifices of older Americans and to reaffirm our commitment to preserving and enhancing their quaHty of life. When Older Americans Month was established in 1963, only 17 million living Americans had reached their 65th birthday. About a third of older Americans lived in poverty, and there were few programs to meet their needs. But Americans were beginning to take a greater interest in their seniors, encouraged by President John F. Kennedy's strong leadership. Today, there are close to 34 million older Americans, and we are better addressing their needs with programs and laws--from Social Security to the Older Americans Act.
The theme for Older Americans Month this year, "Aging: Generations of Experience," recognizes the tremendous experiences and legacy of past generations that we enjoy today. And this year we proudly mark the 30th anniversary of the Older Americans Act. Through the Act's programs, administered by the Administration on Aging, millions of older Americans receive critical home and community-based care services that enable them to continue to live independently within their homes and among their loved ones and friends.
During this Older Americans Month, several thousand delegates from all across America will gather in Washington, D.C., for the historic White House Conference on Aging. And, during this month, we pay tribute to om- country's older Americans and to the family members and volunteers who provide care for them. In addition, as we recognize the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II, we pause to give special recognition to our senior citizens who so valiantly fought for our freedoms.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 1995, as "Older Americans Month." I call upon individual Americans, representatives of government at all levels, businesses and communities, volunteers and educational institutions to appropriately acknowledge the contributions of all older Americans not only this month but also throughout the year.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and nineteenth.

Americans' vitality as a people flows from the health of our families. The heart and soul of our national life, mothers rise each day to take on myriad tasks, from driving a carpool to directing a city council. They are an anchor to generations past and a bridge to the world of the future. Meeting the challenge of motherhood is one of society's greatest responsibilities, and those who do this work every day do a service to all humanity.
Whether biological, foster, or adoptive, mothers have a unique ability to caution and care for their children and to instill in them the values of honesty, respect, and faith. As role models for their children, mothers show by example the infinite possibilities of life.
No matter our age, our mothers are ready to understand, to love, and to listen. We best observe this special day by living our lives to reflect the love they have given us and by teaching our children to hope for a brighter tomorrow.
To honor all mothers and their special place in our hearts, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 8, 1914 (38 Stat. 770), has designated the second Sunday in May each year as "Mother's Day" and requested the President to call for its appropriate observance.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Sunday, May 14, 1995, as "Mother's Day." I urge all Americans to consider how much mothers have contributed to the well-being of our Nation. I call upon our citizens to observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.

The United States Coast Guard, the National Safe Boating Council, and the many State and local recreational boating organizations and governmental agencies are working with volunteer organizations across the country to educate the boating public about the importance of wearing life jackets.

products overseas, spawning new industries and generating jobs at an unprecedented rate.
The national transportation system, with government and industry working together, is a keystone of America's national security strategy. The world is still an unpredictable place, and America continues to have worldwide security and economic interests. The national transportation system gives America the capability to rapidly move military equipment and personnel to meet contingencies, crises, and humanitarian efforts anywhere in the world.
Today, American transportation is moving forward to embrace the exciting possibilities and challenges of the 21st century. Using state-ofthe-art technology, we are developing a single integrated system that links all forms of transportation and enables the user--passenger or shipper--to choose the service that best meets the immediate need. The Department of Transportation is working on a National Transportation System to address modern concerns of efficiency and environmental safety, and we are looking toward States, communities, and the private sector to join in investing strategically in the transportation infrastructure of the future.
This week, Americans honor the men and women who build, maintain, and monitor the safety of our transportation system--from air traffic controllers to railroad safety inspectors to aerospace machinists building the planes of tomorrow. We salute our transportation industry workers for their countless contributions to our Nation and for helping to ensure that our transportation system remains the finest in the world.
In recognition of the millions of Americans who work every day to meet our transportation needs, the Congress, by joint resolution approved May 16, 1957 (36 U.S.C. 160), has designated the third Friday in May of each year as "National Defense Transportation Day" and, by joint resolution approved May 14, 1962 (36 U.S.C. 166), declared that the week in which that Friday falls be designated "National Transportation Week."
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J.

Proclamation 6800 of May 15,1995

Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week, 1995

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Each year, we pause to remember and to honor the brave men and women whose heartfeh commitment to the law and to their fellow citizens cost them their lives. During 1994, we lost 56 law enforcement officers to on-duty accidents. Seventy-six officers--72 State and local police and four Federal agents--were murdered. Thirty-three of these officers were wearing body armor when they were killed. All but one were killed with a firearm. Three were gunned down inside police headquarters in our Nation's capital.
America's law enforcement officers face extraordinary risks--^breaking up a drug ring, apprehending a fugitive, responding to an incident of domestic violence, even making a traffic stop. Since the first recorded police death in this country in 1794, more than 13,500 law enforcement officers have been killed in the line of duty. On average, more than 62,000 officers are assaulted and some 20,000 are injured each year.
Tragically, the dangers of law enforcement service are increasing. From 1960 to 1993, the number of violent crimes in America increased 567 percent. In the past 10 years, it increased 51 percent. During 1993, more than 1.9 million violent crimes--murders, rapes, robberies, and assaults--were reported to police. And our police responded.
Despite the rising tide of crime, good and brave men and women continue to join the ranks of law enforcement. Today, more than 600,000 sworn officers work every day to preserve the peace and improve the safety of cities and towns across America. These heroic individuals and their fallen colleagues come from many different backgrounds. But they are linked by a common faith--that freedom is worth defending and that justice shall prevail. For those who died to uphold these ideals and for those who still stand to protect them, we salute America's law enforcement officials.
The Congress, by a joint resolution approved October 1, 1962 (76 Stat. 676), has authorized and requested the President to designate May 15 of each year as "Peace Officers Memorial Day," and the week in which it falls as "Police Week," and by Public Law 103-322 (36 U.S.C. 175) has requested that the flag be flown at half-staff on Peace Officers Memorial Day.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 15, 1995, as Peace Officers Memorial Day, and May 14-20, 1995, as Police Week. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this occasion with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities. I also request the Governors of the United States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the appropriate officials of all units of government, to direct that the flag be flown at half-staff on Peace Officers Memorial Day on all buildings, grounds, and naval vessels throughout the United States and in all areas under its jurisdiction and control, and I invite the people of the

109 STAT. 1788

Proclamation 6801 of May 17,1995
Labor History Month, 1995
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Among the most insistent themes in the history of American democracy has been the determination of our workers to find dignity in their work and meaning in their citizenship. The labor movement has long given voice to these aspirations. American trade unionists have fought for and achieved benefits for all of us by strengthening citizens' roles in the workplace and by expanding their participation in the political lives of their communities.
Gone is the time when the average American worker made about ten dollars for a 60-hour week, and more than 2 million children worked similarly long hours for even less pay. The national labor movement has helped ensure safe working conditions, regular hours, decent living wages, and paid holidays and vacations. And in 1993 we moved a step further, affording hard-working Americans the right to emergency family leave.
Workers have been leaders in the efforts to establish the 8-hour day, the 40-hour week, security in unemployment and old age, protection for the sick and injured and for children, equal employment opportunity, and health and safety standards. And the labor movement has strived to make public education available for every child. American workers have helped to make this progress possible, and our country is immeasurably stronger because of it.
As we observe Labor History Month this year, we understand that our work is not yet finished. Today's global marketplace demands that we establish and strengthen partnerships between employers and unions, cooperate to achieve safe, high-performance work environments, improve the skills of American workers and the competitiveness of American businesses, and further enhance human dignity in the workplace. The challenges we face are many, but the history of our accomplishments assures us that the future looks bright indeed.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 1995, as "Labor History Month." I call upon the people of the United States to observe this period with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.

Prayer for Peace, Memorial Day, 1995
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
The essence of America is the quality and breadth of the freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution. Yet far too often in our country's history, the price of preserving these freedoms has been the hves of our Nation's young men and women and the heartbreak of their famiHes and friends. The Ught and laughter of our lost sons and daughters can never be replaced. But the gift of their courage will always endure. America remembers the sacrifices of those who gave their lives to protect our liberty. For our citizens and for freedom-loving people around the world, they have kept democracy's flame burning brightly.
Forged in revolution and tempered by more than two centuries of fighting injustice, America has grown stronger, determined to safeguard the blessings that have been so hard-won. As we recall the selfless devotion of those who have risen to defend the cause of freedom, we resolve today that their efforts shall not have been in vain. America still holds fast to the principles upon which it was founded, and its people still stand bound together by our common faith in peace. In remembrance of our fallen heroes, we pray that peace will forever grace our land, that it will guide relations between citizens and friendships among nations, and that our people will one day see a time when harmony fills the Earth.
May God comfort all who mourn.
In respect and recognition of the courageous men and women to whom we pay tribute, the Congress, by joint resolution approved on May 11, 1950 (64 Stat. 158), has requested the President to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to observe each Memorial Day as a day of prayer for permanent peace and designating a period on that day when the people of the United States might unite in prayer.
NOW, THEREFORE. I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Memorial Day, May 29, 1995, as a day of prayer for permanent peace. I designate the hour beginning in each locality at 11 o'clock in the morning of that day as a time to join in prayer. I urge the press, radio, television, and all information media to take part in this observance.
I also request the Governors of the United States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the appropriate officials of all units of government, to direct that the flag be flown at half-staff until noon during this Memorial Day on all buildings, grounds, and naval vessels

Proclamation 6803 of May 19,1995
National Maritime Day, 1995
By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation
The United States owes much to our merchant sailors. At our Nation's beginning, these outstanding citizens opened new avenues of commerce and helped nurture a fledgling democracy into a beacon of freedom for people around the world. Since President Franklin D. Roosevelt first proclaimed National Maritime Day 62 years ago, the U.S. Merchant Marine has built on its legacy of patriotism. Its great tradition of courage and valor is an inspiration to all Americans.
This year, as we honor those who served and sacrificed for our Nation during World War II, the contributions of the U.S. Merchant Marine are a special source of pride. We will always remember the heroism of those mariners and the dangers they faced to protect our liberty.
America's Merchant Marine and civilian seafarers have put themselves at risk time and again to support our Armed Forces. They provided pivotal service during OPERATION DESERT STORM, during America's humanitarian mission in Somalia, and throughout OPERATION RESTORE DEMOCRACY in Haiti.
Today, our country remains determined to maintain a strong U.S. flag presence on the high seas, a commitment central to advancing our Nation's national and economic security. I urge Americans to join efforts in support of maritime revitalization legislation and our ongoing shipbuilding production program. Americans' pioneering spirit has endowed our Nation with the most innovative maritime technologies and the most skilled maritime labor force on Earth. Working together, we can preserve this critical advantage for generations to come.
In recognition of the importance of the U.S. Merchant Marine, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 20, 1933, has designated May 22 of each year as "National Maritime Day" and has authorized and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation calling for its appropriate observance.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 22, 1995, as National Maritime Day. I urge the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities and by displaying the flag of the United States at their homes and in their commu-

Proclamation 6804 of May 22,1995
To Modify Duty-Free Treatment Under the Generalized System of Preferences and for Other Purposes
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
1. Pursuant to section 504(c) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended ("Trade Act") (19 U.S.C. 2464(c)), beneficiary developing countries, except those designated as least-developed beneficiary developing countries pursuant to section 504(c)(6) of the Trade Act, are subject to limitations on the preferential treatment afforded under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). I have determined, pursuant to sections 504(a)(1), (c)(1), and (c)(2) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2464(a)(1), (c)(1), and (c)(2)), that certain beneficiary developing countries should no longer receive preferential tariff treatment under the GSP with respect to certain eligible articles.
2. To reflect clearly the names of certain beneficiary developing countries under the GSP, I have decided that it is necessary and appropriate to modify general note 4 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS).
3. In Proclamation No. 6767 of February 3, 1995, conforming changes with respect to certain articles under the GSP were omitted. I have decided that it is necessary and appropriate to modify the HTS to make such conforming changes.
4. Proclamation No. 6763 of December 23, 1994, implemented the Uruguay Round Agreements, including Schedule XX, with respect to the United States and incorporated in the HTS tariff modifications necessary and appropriate to carry out the Uruguay Round Agreements. Certain technical errors, including inadvertent omissions, were made in that proclamation. I have determined that it is necessary to reflect accurately the intended tariff treatment provided for in the Uruguay Round Agreements to modify certain provisions of the HTS as set forth in Annex III to this proclamation.
5. Section 604 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2483) authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the substance of the relevant provisions of that Act, and of other Acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.

Proclamation 6807 of June 2,1995
National Homeownership Day, 1995
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Throughout the more than two hundred years since our Nation was founded, Americans have embraced the dream of homeownership. Strengthening families, establishing communities, and fostering prosperity, homeownership is the cornerstone of our economy and a common thread in our national life. Thanks to a tradition of cooperation between government and industry, the doors of homeownership have been opened to millions of Americans. And the United States is one of the first countries in the world to make homeownership a reality for a majority of its people.
For the better part of this century, America has made homeownership a priority of national policy. The National Housing Act of 1934 created the Federal Housing Administration's home mortgage insurance program, empowering more than 23 million Americans to buy their own homes. In 1944, the GI Bill of Rights set up the Veterans Administration's home loan guaranty program, enabling millions of veterans to start a new life for themselves and their families. The Housing Act of 1949 declared that every American family should enjoy a "decent home and a suitable living environment"--an ideal that has been reaffirmed in myriad ways since then.
Our country's long-standing commitment to this goal is a testament to the tremendous rewards of homeownership. Homeownership spurs the production and sales of goods and services, generating new jobs and brightening America's economic horizon. It encourages savings and investment, promotes economic and civic responsibility, and enhances the financial security of the American people. Perhaps most important, homeownership gives Americans pride in their neighborhoods and hope for a brighter tomorrow.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 5,

PROCLAMATION 6808-^JUNE 9, 1995

1995, as "National Homeownership Day." I urge all of our citizens to observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities that celebrate the great American Dream.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of June, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and nineteenth.

Proclamation 6808 of June 9, 1995
Flag Day and National Flag Week, 1995
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
This week, Americans celebrate the Flag of the United States, which for more than two centuries has brought our people together in a common bond of citizenship. We reaffirm our allegiance to freedom's banner--"Old Glory"--and to the proud history it has inspired. We honor the valor and sacrifices of all who have defended it--in public service and on battlegrounds around the world. And we rededicate ourselves to the democratic ideals stitched forever into the fabric of America.
In towns and cities across the country, public buildings fly the Stars and Stripes as a symbol of our Nation's spirit of community. That spirit was never more evident than this past April in Oklahoma, where the flag appeared on the sleeves of rescue workers, emergency personnel, and volunteers from throughout the land. A shining badge of honor, it reminded all who mourned that we Americans have seen countless trials and have emerged from each one stronger than ever.
Earlier this year, in expressing our gratitude to the men and women who served in uniform during the Second World War, the Nation observed the fiftieth anniversary of the Battle of Iwo Jima. We recalled the day, immortalized in sculpture, when a team of brave Americans beat all odds and hoisted aloft the American flag. May we, the heirs of the freedom they fought to defend, always remember their courage and serve as loyal standard-bearers for the cause of liberty.
To commemorate the adoption of our flag, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved August 3, 1949 (63 Stat. 492), designated June 14 of each year as "Flag Day" and requested the President to issue an annual Proclamation calling for its observance and for the display of the Flag of the United States on all Government buildings. The Congress also requested the President, by joint resolution approved June 9, 1966 (80 Stat. 194), to issue annually a Proclamation designating the week in which June 14 occurs as "National Flag Week," and calling upon all citizens of the United States to display the flag during that week.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim June 14, 1995, as Flag Day and the week beginning June 11, 1995, as National Flag Week. I direct the appropriate officials of the Government to display the Flag of the United States on all Government buildings during that week. I urge Ameri-

Proclamation 6806 of May 26,1995
Time for the National Observance of the Fiftieth Anniversary of World War II, 1995
By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation
In remembering the nightmare we now know as World War II, it is natural and fitting that we pause to mourn our loss. Eleven million service members--more than 400,000 of them American--perished in that war. Countless more civilians died in its awful course. We Americans retain a special bond to all of these heroes. We've seen pictures of their faces and told stories of their courage. For when the darkest days of fear seemed to tear our world apart, the brave millions we now honor kept liberty alive.
As the forces of oppression sought to extinguish freedom's light, Americans from every walk of life heard the call to service. Women joined our Nation's factories, and farmers doubled their efforts in our fields. Victory gardens flourished across the land, and although the rationing of goods made our dinners less than feasts, the sharing of a cause filled our hearts with hope. Hand in hand, our parents and grandparents led our Nation on to victory, and together with our allies, we prevailed.
Like the men and women who fought half a century ago, Americans today are just as bound to defend the cause of freedom. Now as then, we are privileged to see the triumph of democracy in nations too long oppressed. Now as then, we know that service is our highest call. And still today, we pray for lasting peace.
May the spirit of those prayers forever grace our land. May they guide relations between citizens and friendships among nations. May our children remember our cause well, and may they one day see a time when harmony fills the Earth.

Proclamation 6807 of June 2,1995
National Homeownership Day, 1995
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Throughout the more than two hundred years since our Nation was founded, Americans have embraced the dream of homeownership. Strengthening families, establishing communities, and fostering prosperity, homeownership is the cornerstone of our economy and a common thread in our national life. Thanks to a tradition of cooperation between government and industry, the doors of homeownership have been opened to millions of Americans. And the United States is one of the first countries in the world to make homeownership a reality for a majority of its people.
For the better part of this century, America has made homeownership a priority of national policy. The National Housing Act of 1934 created the Federal Housing Administration's home mortgage insurance program, empowering more than 23 million Americans to buy their own homes. In 1944, the GI Bill of Rights set up the Veterans Administration's home loan guaranty program, enabling millions of veterans to start a new life for themselves and their families. The Housing Act of 1949 declared that every American family should enjoy a "decent home and a suitable living environment"--an ideal that has been reaffirmed in myriad ways since then.
Our country's long-standing commitment to this goal is a testament to the tremendous rewards of homeownership. Homeownership spurs the production and sales of goods and services, generating new jobs and brightening America's economic horizon. It encourages savings and investment, promotes economic and civic responsibility, and enhances the financial security of the American people. Perhaps most important, homeownership gives Americans pride in their neighborhoods and hope for a brighter tomorrow.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 5,

Proclamation 6805 of May 22,1995

World Trade Week, 1995

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
American exports bolster the quality of life for countless people, supporting 10.5 million jobs here at home and supplying popular American products to millions worldwide. They fuel our Nation's economy, create high-wage jobs for our citizens, and link us to countries everywhere. That is why my Administration supported NAFTA and brought the Uruguay Round GATT negotiations to a successful conclusion. As we celebrate World Trade Week this year, we pause to recognize the many ways in which "Exporting is Everybody's Business."
In the two years since my Administration launched this country's first National Export Strategy, America has led the way in trade promotion and advocacy efforts, strengthening existing programs and developing new initiatives to serve U.S. exporters. The Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee (TPCC) has worked to create a more streamlined, responsive, and effective system that enhances our Nation's economy and helps our firms to compete successfully around the globe.
During the past year, we have worked to develop a new, innovative trade finance strategy. The Export-Import Bank of the United States, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the Trade and Development Agency, the Small Business Administration, and the Departments of the Treasury and Commerce have provided new forms of trade finance that help our firms to compete in the global marketplace. We are addressing the removal of unnecessary and ineffective export controls and streamlining the licensing process, liberalizing controls on a range of high-technology products and increasing the effectiveness of multilateral control regimes.
With the restructuring of the U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service, now the Commercial Service of the United States, the Department of Commerce is working in partnership with the businesses it serves, promoting U.S. exports, advocating U.S. business interests abroad, assisting U.S. firms to realize their export potential, and supporting the export promotion efforts of other public and private organizations. By the end of this year, 15 U.S. Export Assistance Centers will be open across the country, offering virtually every American business person a coordinated, multi-faceted, international trade team close at hand.
Already, U.S. exports to our neighbors in the Southern Hemisphere exceed $92 billion, generating good jobs for our workers and demonstrating our competitiveness throughout the international marketplace. At the Summit of the Americas this past December, our Nation reaffirmed its commitment to the extension of free trade throughout the Hemisphere by the year 2005--an opportunity that promises to bolster our economy even further. These efforts, combined with our progress with the countries of the Organization for Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), mean trade gains of historic proportions. And that means more jobs for hardworking Americans.
Still, much remains to be done. U.S. exporters must be given every opportunity to sell our products freely and fairly. Our companies must

meet the challenge of venturing into new markets. They must keep quality high and production efficient, while marketing American goods and services to new customers around the world. The work is difficult, but the rewards are great: a strong economy, better goods and services, and a brighter future for all of us.

Proclamation 6810 of July 17, 1995
Captive Nations Week, 1995
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
As we mark the 36th observance of "Captive Nations Week," Americans reflect on the sorrow of peoples throughout the world who are physically and spiritually oppressed by their governments. In our hearts, we know that the ongoing struggle for individual liberty is part of a larger cause--an international quest for true peace. Recent years have seen great progress in the global march toward freedom. But far too many of humanity's children still live in fear.
Our commemoration of this week reflects the concern of Americans for all of those in need. Having sustained the promise of democracy for more than 200 years, we understand its many blessings and its profound importance in the world. While we celebrate the triumph of democratic governments in nations around the globe, we stay bound to those who remain prisoners of violence, poverty, and prejudice. As beneficiaries of freedom's power, we must champion their struggle, promoting respect for human dignity everywhere on Earth.
Stripped of fundamental personal rights and barred from realizing their political voice, the captive citizens of authoritarian regimes share our people's dreams of happiness. Today, in nations of the former Soviet bloc and from Asia to Africa to Latin America, our new democratic friends are acting on their hopes for opportunity and prosperity, recognizing that respect for individual freedom is the key to internal and international stability. America plays a vital role in this process of growth and change. As President John F. Kennedy said years ago, our "historic task in this embattled age is not merely to defend freedom. It is to extend its writ and strengthen its covenant." We Americans have an enormous stake in the fate of captive nations. Their future is no less than our greatest hope for peace.
The Congress, by Joint Resolution approved July 17, 1959 (73 Stat. 212), has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation designating the third week in July of each year as "Captive Nations Week."
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim July 16 through July 22, 1995, as Captive Nations Week. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities, re-

Proclamation 6811 of July 21,1995
Parents* Day, 1995
By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation
Parenthood is among the most difficult and most rewarding responsibilities in life. Balancing countless demands, parents must be firm yet loving, protective yet liberating. They are the nurturers of our dreams and the soothers of our fears. They instill in their children, by word and example, the importance of family and community involvement, the value of education and hard work.
Parenting is a serious responsibility. All parents have an obligation to provide for the children they bring into the world. Parents must teach and sustain, helping to empower each new generation to meet the challenges and opportunities of life with confidence.
Today, across our country, parents give their time and energy to ensure a better future for their children. Teaching the lessons of honesty and caring in a way that no school or government can, America's parents pass on the spirit, values, and traditions that have made our Nation strong for more than two centuries. Whether stepparents or foster parents, biological or adoptive, parents provide the security, stability, and love that enable children to grow up healthy, happy, and strong.
Parents' Day is a welcome opportunity to celebrate the special and powerful bond between parent and child. On this occasion, let us remember and pay respect to those who give us the daily support and loving guidance that lead us to become responsible and contributing citizens.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, in accordance with Public Law 103-362, do hereby proclaim Sunday, July 23, 1995, as "Parents' Day." I invite the States, communities, and the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities expressing gratitude and abiding affection for parents.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of July, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twentieth.

National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day, 1995

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
On July 27, 1953, the guns finally fell silent over the Korean peninsula. Three years of fierce struggle, costing over 600,000 lives among U.S. and allied combatants, ended with a negotiated cease-fire at Panmunjom. At that moment, in the midst of the Cold War, facing the burden of containing a hostile communist world, America could not yet see clearly all that the Korean War had achieved.
Time and history have cleared our vision. More than four decades later, we look back in awe and gratitude at what our Armed Forces and allies accomplished in Korea. Under the banner of the United Nations, they fought to defend freedom and human dignity in the Korean peninsula, demonstrating to the world's totalitarian regimes that men and women of goodwill were ready to pay the ultimate price so that others might enjoy the blessings of liberty. They helped the Republic of South Korea grow, survive, and prosper as an independent and democratic nation and a strong friend of the United States. With their quiet courage and stern resolve, American troops sowed the seeds for the triumph of democracy that is sweeping across the globe today.
Now, at long last, we have a fitting memorial to honor the achievements and the sacrifice of our Korean War veterans. From across this country and around the world, these veterans will gather in our Nation's capital to dedicate the Korean War Veterans Memorial, the enduring testament to their valor and generosity of spirit. America honors their service; we remember their sacrifice; and we are forever in their debt.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim July 27, 1995, as "National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day." I call upon all Americans to observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities in honor of our Nation's Korean War veterans.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentysixth day of July, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninetyfive, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twentieth.

Father's Day, 1995
By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation
As children finish the school year and families begin to enjoy the long days of summer, Americans across the country reach out to their fathers in thanks. Every year, Father's Day gives us a chance to spend time with our families and to honor the bond between parent and child. It is a moment for dads to find joy in the blessings that fatherhood brings. And it is a day for remembering that children can grow up immeasurably stronger with the gift of a father's love.
The most fortunate among us can claim warm memories of our fathers' lessons--^times when dads can be models of energy and patience. Whether encouraging their children in taking their first steps, riding a bike or meeting other challenges in life, fathers teach us the importance of balance and stand behind us until we're steady. Through the scrapes and self-doubts that every young person confronts, fathers can be our role models and heroes, soothing childhood fears and instilling the steady values of hard work and fair play. They are our guidance counselors and our best friends. Their faith inspires us to try again when we fail and fills us with pride when we succeed. As coaches and caregivers, teachers and workers, fathers who make parenthood a priority earn their families' lasting respect.
We Americans rely on our fathers for courage and compassion, and the security of having them with us gives us confidence in all of our endeavors. On this special day, let America's sons and daughters show their fathers that they care. Let us continue to strive for a world in which every child grows up safe--a world in which every child knows that though they may feel sometimes unsteady, their fathers are behind them always.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, in accordance with a joint resolution of the Congress approved April 24, 1972 (36 U.S.C. 142a), do hereby proclaim Sunday, June 18, 1995, as "Father's Day." I invite the States, communities, and

Proclamation 6810 of July 17, 1995
Captive Nations Week, 1995
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
As we mark the 36th observance of "Captive Nations Week," Americans reflect on the sorrow of peoples throughout the world who are physically and spiritually oppressed by their governments. In our hearts, we know that the ongoing struggle for individual liberty is part of a larger cause--an international quest for true peace. Recent years have seen great progress in the global march toward freedom. But far too many of humanity's children still live in fear.
Our commemoration of this week reflects the concern of Americans for all of those in need. Having sustained the promise of democracy for more than 200 years, we understand its many blessings and its profound importance in the world. While we celebrate the triumph of democratic governments in nations around the globe, we stay bound to those who remain prisoners of violence, poverty, and prejudice. As beneficiaries of freedom's power, we must champion their struggle, promoting respect for human dignity everywhere on Earth.
Stripped of fundamental personal rights and barred from realizing their political voice, the captive citizens of authoritarian regimes share our people's dreams of happiness. Today, in nations of the former Soviet bloc and from Asia to Africa to Latin America, our new democratic friends are acting on their hopes for opportunity and prosperity, recognizing that respect for individual freedom is the key to internal and international stability. America plays a vital role in this process of growth and change. As President John F. Kennedy said years ago, our "historic task in this embattled age is not merely to defend freedom. It is to extend its writ and strengthen its covenant." We Americans have an enormous stake in the fate of captive nations. Their future is no less than our greatest hope for peace.
The Congress, by Joint Resolution approved July 17, 1959 (73 Stat. 212), has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation designating the third week in July of each year as "Captive Nations Week."
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim July 16 through July 22, 1995, as Captive Nations Week. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities, re-

Parents* Day, 1995
By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation
Parenthood is among the most difficult and most rewarding responsibilities in life. Balancing countless demands, parents must be firm yet loving, protective yet liberating. They are the nurturers of our dreams and the soothers of our fears. They instill in their children, by word and example, the importance of family and community involvement, the value of education and hard work.
Parenting is a serious responsibility. All parents have an obligation to provide for the children they bring into the world. Parents must teach and sustain, helping to empower each new generation to meet the challenges and opportunities of life with confidence.
Today, across our country, parents give their time and energy to ensure a better future for their children. Teaching the lessons of honesty and caring in a way that no school or government can, America's parents pass on the spirit, values, and traditions that have made our Nation strong for more than two centuries. Whether stepparents or foster parents, biological or adoptive, parents provide the security, stability, and love that enable children to grow up healthy, happy, and strong.
Parents' Day is a welcome opportunity to celebrate the special and powerful bond between parent and child. On this occasion, let us remember and pay respect to those who give us the daily support and loving guidance that lead us to become responsible and contributing citizens.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, in accordance with Public Law 103-362, do hereby proclaim Sunday, July 23, 1995, as "Parents' Day."

Proclamation 6808 of June 9, 1995
Flag Day and National Flag Week, 1995
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
This week, Americans celebrate the Flag of the United States, which for more than two centuries has brought our people together in a common bond of citizenship. We reaffirm our allegiance to freedom's banner--"Old Glory"--and to the proud history it has inspired. We honor the valor and sacrifices of all who have defended it--in public service and on battlegrounds around the world. And we rededicate ourselves to the democratic ideals stitched forever into the fabric of America.
In towns and cities across the country, public buildings fly the Stars and Stripes as a symbol of our Nation's spirit of community. That spirit was never more evident than this past April in Oklahoma, where the flag appeared on the sleeves of rescue workers, emergency personnel, and volunteers from throughout the land. A shining badge of honor, it reminded all who mourned that we Americans have seen countless trials and have emerged from each one stronger than ever.
Earlier this year, in expressing our gratitude to the men and women who served in uniform during the Second World War, the Nation observed the fiftieth anniversary of the Battle of Iwo Jima. We recalled the day, immortalized in sculpture, when a team of brave Americans beat all odds and hoisted aloft the American flag. May we, the heirs of the freedom they fought to defend, always remember their courage and serve as loyal standard-bearers for the cause of liberty.
To commemorate the adoption of our flag, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved August 3, 1949 (63 Stat. 492), designated June 14 of each year as "Flag Day" and requested the President to issue an annual Proclamation calling for its observance and for the display of the Flag of the United States on all Government buildings. The Congress also requested the President, by joint resolution approved June 9, 1966 (80 Stat. 194), to issue annually a Proclamation designating the week in which June 14 occurs as "National Flag Week," and calling upon all citizens of the United States to display the flag during that week.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim June 14, 1995, as Flag Day and the week beginning June 11, 1995, as National Flag Week. I direct the appropriate officials of the Government to display the Flag of the United States on all Government buildings during that week. I urge Ameri-

Proclamation 6814 of August 5,1995
National Child Support Awareness Month, 1995
By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation
Providing for our children is one of humanity's worthiest and most fundamental endeavors. Children are the best part of ourselves--the sum of our past and the promise of our future, the guarantee that our lives and values and dreams will flourish long after we are gone. Sadly, however, many parents in our country today deny the instinct to care for their children, failing to provide even the most basic economic support. Millions of America's children have no legally identified father. Millions do not receive the financial support they need to lead secure and healthy lives.
Because of these harsh realities, I have made the reform of our Nation's child support system one of the top priorities of my Administration. The welfare reform plan that I proposed to the Congress last year contains the toughest child support enforcement measures in America's history--measures that would improve the effectiveness of procedures for establishing paternity, make it easier to enter and update child support awards, and dramatically strengthen our ability to enforce payment of those awards. My proposals would also give us the ability to track deadbeat parents across State lines, suspend their driver's licenses if necessary, and make them work off what they owe.
As the Nation's largest single employer, the Federal Government must take a leadership role in the effort to ensure that all of America's chil-

PROCLAMATION 6815--AUG. 7, 1995

109 STAT. 1807

dren are properly supported. In February of this year, I signed an Executive order requiring Federal agencies to cooperate fully with measures to establish and enforce child support orders and to inform employees of how they can meet their support obligations. Additionally, we are encouraging State and local governments to develop innovative approaches to helping families cope with child support issues, and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has begun to restructure and strengthen its partnerships with State child support agencies.
This month we celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Child Support Enforcement Program at HHS. This program--at the Federal, State, and local levels--has been instrumental in giving hope and support to America's children while fostering strong families and responsible parenting. Through their efforts, over 5.1 million children now have a legally recognized father; more than 11.7 million children with a parent living outside of their homes have a legal right to the financial support of that parent; and over $72.5 billion has been provided for children by their noncustodial parents.
But for all that we have accomplished, we still have much to do. By ensuring the enactment jmd implementation of my Administration's strong child support enforcement proposals, we will send a clear signal to our citizens that they should not have children until they are prepared to care for them. Those who do bring children into the world must bear the responsibility of supporting them. We must rededicate ourselves to the task of putting these youngest and most vulnerable of our citizens first.
NOW. THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim August 1995, as "National Child Support Awareness Month." I call upon the citizens of the United States to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.

At its best, our free enterprise system works to ensure that all of our citizens have the opportunity to contribute fully to America's economic growth and to benefit fully from our economy's success. However, the road to entrepreneurial achievement is seldom easy. Those who undertake the journey must be talented, determined, and brave.

Proclamation 6813 of July 28,1995
To Amend the Generalized System of Preferences
By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation 1. Pursuant to section 504(c) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended ("Trade Act")(19 U.S.C. 2464(c)), beneficiary developing countries are

109 STAT. 1804

PROCLAMATION 6813^RJLY 28, 1995

subject to limitations on the preferential treatment afforded under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). Pursuant to section 504(c)(3) of the Trade Act, the President may waive the application of section 504(c) of the Trade Act after receiving the advice of the hitemational Trade Commission, determining that the waiver is in the national economic interest of the United States, and publishing such determination in the Federal Register. Pursuant to section 504(c)(5) of the Trade Act, a country that is no longer treated as a beneficiary developing country with respect to an eligible article may be redesignated as a beneficiary developing country with respect to such article if imports of such article from such country did not exceed the limitations in section 504(c)(1) of the Trade Act during the preceding calendar year. Pursuant to section 504(d)(2) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2464(d)(2)), the President may disregard the limitations provided in section 504(c)(1)(B) of the Trade Act with respect to any eligible article if the appraised value of the total imports of such article into the United States during the preceding calendar year is not in excess of an amount that bears the same ratio to $5,000,000 as the gross national product of the United States for that calendar year (as determined by the Department of Commerce) bears to the gross national product of the United States for calendar year 1979.

2. Section 502(b)(7) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2462(b)(7)) provides that a country that has not taken or is not taking steps to afford workers in that country internationally recognized worker rights, as defined in section 502(a)(4) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2462(a)(4)), is ineligible for designation as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP. Section 502(c)(7) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2462(c)(7)) provides that, in determining whether to designate a country as a beneficiary developing country under the GSP, the President shall take into account whether the country has taken or is taking steps to afford internationally recognized worker rights to workers in that country. Section 504 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2464) authorizes the President to withdraw, suspend, or limit the application of duty-free treatment under the GSP with respect to any country after considering the factors set forth in sections 501 and 502(c) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2461 and 2462(c)).
3. Pursuant to section 504(c)(3) of the Trade Act, I have determined that it is appropriate to waive the application of section 504(c) of the Trade Act with respect to certain eligible articles from a beneficiary developing country. I have received the advice of the International Trade Commission on whether any industries in the United States are likely to be adversely affected by such waivers and I have determined, based on that advice and the considerations described in sections 501 and 502(c) of the Trade Act, that such waivers are in the national economic interest of the United States. Pursuant to section 504(c)(5) of the Trade Act, I have determined that a country should be redesignated as a beneficiary developing country with respect to certain eligible articles. Pursuant to section 504(d)(2) of the Trade Act, I have determined that section 504(c)(1)(B) of the Trade Act should not apply with respect to certain eligible articles.
4. Pursuant to sections 502(b)(7), 502(c)(7), and 504 of the Trade Act, I have determined that Maldives has not taken and is not taking steps to afford internationally recognized worker rights to workers in Maldives. Accordingly, I have determined that it is appropriate to sus-

PROCLAMATION 6813-^JULY 28, 1995

109 STAT. 1805

pend the designation of Maldives as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP.
5. Pursuant to sections 501 and 502 of the Trade Act, and having due regard for the eligibility criteria set forth therein, I have determined that it is appropriate to designate Moldova as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP.
6. Section 604 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2483) authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) the substance of the provisions of that Act, and of other acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including but not limited to sections 501, 502, 504, and 604 of the Trade Act, do proclaim that:

Proclamation 6814 of August 5,1995
National Child Support Awareness Month, 1995
By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation
Providing for our children is one of humanity's worthiest and most fundamental endeavors. Children are the best part of ourselves--the sum of our past and the promise of our future, the guarantee that our lives and values and dreams will flourish long after we are gone. Sadly, however, many parents in our country today deny the instinct to care for their children, failing to provide even the most basic economic support. Millions of America's children have no legally identified father. Millions do not receive the financial support they need to lead secure and healthy lives.
Because of these harsh realities, I have made the reform of our Nation's child support system one of the top priorities of my Administration. The welfare reform plan that I proposed to the Congress last year contains the toughest child support enforcement measures in America's history--measures that would improve the effectiveness of procedures for establishing paternity, make it easier to enter and update child support awards, and dramatically strengthen our ability to enforce payment of those awards. My proposals would also give us the ability to track deadbeat parents across State lines, suspend their driver's licenses if necessary, and make them work off what they owe.
As the Nation's largest single employer, the Federal Government must take a leadership role in the effort to ensure that all of America's chil-

PROCLAMATION 6815--AUG. 7, 1995

109 STAT. 1807

dren are properly supported. In February of this year, I signed an Executive order requiring Federal agencies to cooperate fully with measures to establish and enforce child support orders and to inform employees of how they can meet their support obligations. Additionally, we are encouraging State and local governments to develop innovative approaches to helping families cope with child support issues, and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has begun to restructure and strengthen its partnerships with State child support agencies.
This month we celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Child Support Enforcement Program at HHS. This program--at the Federal, State, and local levels--has been instrumental in giving hope and support to America's children while fostering strong families and responsible parenting. Through their efforts, over 5.1 million children now have a legally recognized father; more than 11.7 million children with a parent living outside of their homes have a legal right to the financial support of that parent; and over $72.5 billion has been provided for children by their noncustodial parents.
But for all that we have accomplished, we still have much to do. By ensuring the enactment jmd implementation of my Administration's strong child support enforcement proposals, we will send a clear signal to our citizens that they should not have children until they are prepared to care for them. Those who do bring children into the world must bear the responsibility of supporting them. We must rededicate ourselves to the task of putting these youngest and most vulnerable of our citizens first.
NOW. THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim August 1995, as "National Child Support Awareness Month." I call upon the citizens of the United States to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of August, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twentieth.

Proclamation 6815 of August 7,1995
Minority Enterprise Development Week, 1995
By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation For citizens throughout the Nation, entrepreneurship is a proven gateway to economic empowerment. At its best, our free enterprise system works to ensure that all of our citizens have the opportunity to contribute fully to America's economic growth and to benefit fully from our economy's success. However, the road to entrepreneurial achievement is seldom easy. Those who undertake the journey must be talented, determined, and brave. But America has a history of rewarding risk-takers, and there is much to be gained in the attempt.

109 STAT. 1808

PROCLAMATION 6816--AUG. 16, 1995

If this country is to continue to prosper in the years ahead, we must hold fast to the promise of minority enterprise development. Business growth in our minority communities creates wealth, encourages selfsufficiency, and generates jobs where they are needed. My Administration is working hard to strengthen all of our Nation's businesses, opening new domestic and international markets, stimulating the efficient use of developed but underutilized land in older cities and towns, and reducing the cost of borrowing for business start-ups and expansions. These innovative efforts are making an impact, and people throughout America are stepping forward to take advantage of the possibilities of investment.
This week plays an important part in our work to promote the growth of the minority business community. As we recognize America's outstanding minority business men and women, we honor their accomplishments and help spur them on to greater heights. Highlighting their success, this occasion touches even those who have not yet dreamed of starting their own businesses. We are all inspired by the example our entrepreneurs have set.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 24 through September 30, 1995, as "Minority Enterprise Development Week." I call on all Americans to commemorate this event with appropriate ceremonies and activities, joining together to recognize the contributions that minority entrepreneurs make every day to our national economic security.

Women's Equality Day, 1995
By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation
Seventy-five years ago this Nation took a great step forward by ratifying the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. Twenty-eight simple words-- "The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex"-- brought to a triumphant conclusion the long decades of struggle waged by generations of suffragists. Looking back from the vantage point of the present, when the contributions and influence of women enrich every facet of our national life, it seems remarkable that as recently as 1920 most American women were still denied their right to full participation in the political activity of this country. Our history continues to remind us that humanity's age-old enemies of ignorance and prejudice are not easily defeated.

But defeated they were, by an army of women and men who, inspired by the staunch courage and unswerving commitment of leaders like Susan B. Anthony, changed people's minds and the course of U.S. history. Using the classic tools of democracy--assembly and petition, exhortation and example, peaceful protest and political shrewdness-- these champions of liberty won a lasting victory for civil rights. The fight was hard, the margins slim, and the outcome often in doubt. But after years of effort and sacrifice, after countless acts of courage and conscience, advocates of women's suffrage rejoiced as the Congress proposed an amendment to the Constitution in 1919 and as Tennessee, the last State needed for ratification, approved that amendment on August 18, 1920, by a single vote, when a young legislator heeded his mother's plea to support suffrage. On August 26, 1920, the 19th Amendment was finally proclaimed part of the United States Constitution, fulfilling Susan B. Anthony's pledge that "failure is impossible."
Women's Equality Day, while a fitting occasion to commemorate this great victory of wisdom over ignorance, is also a time for sober reflection that American democracy is a work in progress. The Declaration of Independence was only the first step in our long journey toward equality for all Americans. And while we have made much progress, until all women have an equal opportunity to develop their full potential and to make contributions that are accepted and welcomed by our society, our freedom as a Nation will be incomplete.
Let us observe Women's Equality Day, then, both as a celebration of past achievement and a promise for the future: a promise to promote and protect with vigor and vigilance the rights of all our citizens; a promise to decry the policies of exclusion and to pursue the ideal of equality for every American; and a promise to empower all of our people to take their rightful place as full and equal partners in the great American enterprise.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim August 26, 1995, as "Women's Equality Day."

National POW/MIA Recognition Day, 1995
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Throughout our proud history, America's sons and daughters have answered the call to defend our fundamental liberties and to safeguard the freedoms of peace-seeking countries around the globe. Representing the finest this Nation has to offer, the members of our Armed Forces have given everything of themselves in defense of the independence and democracy that we hold so dear. This year we have a special opportunity to honor their service as we commemorate the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II, the dedication of the Korean War Veterans Memorial, and the unveiling of the POW and MIA postage stamp.
In remembering these heroic men and women, it is with profound respect and solemn appreciation that we single out those who paid the heaviest price. Among them are the Prisoners of War and those Missing in Action. Their courage and devotion to duty, honor, and country-- often in the face of brutal treatment and torture by their captors--will never be forgotten by the American people.
Our Nation also recognizes that the families of these brave citizens have suffered and made great sacrifices for our country. For it is in the name of both the missing and their loved ones that we aggressively pursue the release of any United States service member held against his or her will, that we search tirelessly for information about the missing, and that we seek the repatriation of recoverable American remains.
On September 15, 1995, the flag of the National League of Families of American Prisoners of War and Missing in Southeast Asia, a black and white banner symbolizing America's missing, will be flown over the White House, the Capitol, the United States Departments of State, Defense, and Veterans Affairs, the Selective Service System Headquarters, the Vietnam Veterans and Korean War Veterans Memorials, and national cemeteries across the country. This flag is a symbol of our Na-

tion's covenant with those who defend us and with the loved ones they leave behind--the brave individuals who have earned our everlasting gratitude and their families who deserve our deepest sympathy and our national pledge to achieve the fullest possible accounting of American troops.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 15, 1995, as "National POW/MIA Recognition Day." I urge State and local officials, private organizations, and citizens everywhere to join in honoring all Prisoners of War and Missing in Action still unaccounted for as a result of their dedicated service to our great country. I also encourage the American people to recognize and acknowledge the steadfast vigil the families of the missing maintain in their quest for answers and a conclusion to their struggle. Finally, I call upon all Americans to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.

America Goes Back to School, 1995
By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation
The beginning of a new school year is a time of renewal and anticipation for families, educators, and communities across America. Teachers ready their classrooms and curricula; law enforcement officers redouble their efforts to keep neighborhoods safe and drug-free; businesses work with schools to create stronger partnerships; and parents everywhere encourage their children to look forward to the challenges ahead.
This time of year also provides us with an occasion to renew our faith in the promise of education--the spark that lights our ambitions and gives us the tools to grow and succeed. To ensure America's continued leadership in the coming century, we must empower every citizen with the knowledge and training necessary to meet new and varied challenges. The generation of young people in school today deserves our Nation's pledge to help them get on the right course and make the most of their lives.
Improving education means strengthening families and schools. Families are responsible for raising children, and parents are their first and most important teachers. Schools are responsible for providing children with quality education and meaningful guidance. But schools and families cannot do it alone. Instead, religious organizations, community leaders, older Americans, volunteer groups, service agencies, industries, and every caring individual must work together, realizing that the complexity of our diverse and changing society demands innova-

tive and effective solutions for helping our children embrace the values of good citizenship.
In March 1994 I signed into law the Goals 2000: Educate America Act, which supports grassroots efforts to help schoolchildren meet high standards for achievement and discipline. School-to-Work programs are uniting businesses, community colleges, and high schools to provide work-study experience and technical expertise, and a new system of direct loans is making a college education more affordable and accessible. This year the Department of Education is deepening its commitment to parent and community involvement by joining the Family Involvement Partnership for Learning to sponsor America Goes Back to School: A Place for Families and the Community. This initiative encourages all Americans to take part in the drive for excellence in education. I am proud that the Department has acted boldly to foster support for America's families and students.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 11 through September 18, 1995, as a time when "America Goes Back to School."

PROCLAMATION 6821--SEPT. 12, 1995

same notes. Whatever cultural tradition is evoked by its cords and rhythms, classical music stirs emotions we all share. Among the many music lovers gathered to enjoy a performance, each individual listener feels the powerful dynamism of music's resonant voice.
This month, let us celebrate the artistic excellence that brings classical music to life. We honor the many remarkable composers, conductors, and performers of the past whose works continue to delight us, and we applaud today's musicians, whose talents remind us of the continuity and grandeur of the humfm experience. Each has contributed to the vast body of music that entertains and inspires people around the globe.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 1995, as "Classical Music Month." I call upon government officials, educators, community organizations, and all the people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities paying tribute to the extraordinary diversity and artistry of classical music.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninetyfive, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twentieth.

To Establish a Tariff-Rate Quota on Certain Tobacco, Eliminate Tariffs on Certain Other Tobacco, and for Other Purposes
By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation
1. (a) On April 15, 1994, I entered into trade agreements resulting from the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations ("the Uruguay Round Agreements"), including the Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization ("the WTO Agreement") and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 ("the GATT 1994"), annexed to the WTO Agreement. In section 101(a) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act ("the URAA") (Public Law 103-465, 108 Stat. 4814)(19 U.S.C. 3511(a)), the United States approved the Uruguay Round Agreements. These agreements entered into force for the United States on January 1, 1995.
(b) Section 125(c) of the Trade Act of 1974 ("the 1974 Act")(19 U.S.C, 2135(c)) provides that whenever the United States, acting in pursuance of any of its rights or obligations under any trade agreement entered into pursuant to the 1974 Act, modifies any obligation with respect to the trade of any foreign country or instrumentality, the President is authorized to proclaim increased duties or other import restrictions, to the extent, at such times, and for such periods as he deems

Proclamation 6822 of September 13,1995
National Farm Safety and Health Week, 1995
By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation
America's agricultural productivity is a gift to our Nation and to people everywhere. Using innovative techniques and the latest technology, our farmers, ranchers, and agricultural workers provide enough food and fiber to satisfy our needs and those of millions of people around the globe. However, we too often forget that farming can be a difficult and dangerous profession.
Agricultural workers are exposed daily to the risks associated with operating powerful machinery, managing livestock, working and travelling in adverse weather conditions, and performing countless other demanding tasks, often miles away from emergency medical care. Sadly, children and young people on our farms and ranches are particularly vulnerable to these hazards and more. .
The simplest safety tool we have at hand is education. By word and by example, we must teach each new generation of Americans about the critical importance of knowledge, caution, and vigilance in farming and ranching activities. Wearing protective clothing and gear, learning the safety features that manufacturers build into equipment, and staying alert to possible dangers when working with livestock, chemicals, machinery, and vehicles--all of these measures can help to ensure longer, healthier lives for America's agricultural workers.
As important as education is to the safety and well-being of our agricultural workers, we must remember that quality health care is just as critical. We must strengthen our resolve to provide the citizens of our rural areas with high-quality, affordable, and accessible health care if we are truly to meet their needs.
By setting aside a special week each year to focus on the need for improved safety and health in our Nation's agricultural industry, we demonstrate to all of our agricultural workers that we value their lives and livelihood, that we appreciate their unsurpassed productivity, and that we honor their determined spirit.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 17 through September 23, 1995, as "National Farm Safety and Health Week." I call upon government agencies, businesses, and professional associations that serve our agricultural sector to strengthen efforts to promote safety and health measures among our Nation's farm and ranch workers. I ask these workers to take advantage of educational programs and technical innovations that can help them to avoid injury and illness. Finally, I call upon the citizens of our Nation to reflect on the bounty we enjoy thanks to the labor of agricultural workers across the land. Join me in renewing our commitment to make their health and safety a national priority.

Proclamation 6823 of September 14, 1995
National Hispanic Heritage Month, 1995
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
America has always drawn strength from the extraordinary diversity of its people. The earliest settlers came to this great land seeking opportunity, bringing with them an abundant wealth of traditions from countries the world over. Thus the vibrant Hispanic culture has long been entwined with our Nation's heritage, and people of Latin American and Spanish ancestry have infused our national life with energy and vision. In the arts, the sciences, the business world, academia, and government, Hispanic Americans have added immeasurably to our progress.
Later this month, I will proudly bestow on the late Willie Velasquez our Nation's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. His landmark work to register Hispanic voters helped to bring these Americans into the mainstream of American public life, and the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project that he founded continues to thrive today.
Last year, I was pleased to sign an Executive order creating the President's Advisory Commission and White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for Hispanic Americans. Recognizing the vital importance of providing every one of our children with fundamental knowledge and skills, the Commission was charged with creating an agenda to increase educational opportunities for Hispanic Americans.
Today, as we stand on the threshold of a new century, we look to the outstanding contributions of Hispanic Americans for inspiration and leadership. Let us join in support of Hispanic children and families as they strive to fulfill the American Dream.
To pay tribute to the achievements of Hispanic citizens and to honor the importance of Latin American and Spanish traditions in our national culture, the Congress, by Public Law 100--402, has authorized and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation designating September 15 through October 15 as "National Hispanic Heritage Month."
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim September 15 through October 15, 1995, as National Hispanic Heritage Month. I call upon government officials, educators, and all the people of the United States to honor this observance with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities, and encourage all Americans to rededicate themselves to the pursuit of equality.

Proclamation 6824 of September 15,1995
National Rehabilitation Week, 1995
By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation National Rehabilitation Week offers us a unique opportunity each year to measure our progress on the long road to creating a totally accessible society in America. This year, as we also mark the 5th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the 75th anniversary of the Rehabilitation Act of 1920, we can look back with satisfaction on the tremendous advances we have made on our journey.
Because of the passage and implementation of these landmark pieces of legislation, millions of Americans with disabilities have received the training and skills to become competitive and productive employees. Working Americans who became disabled in mid-life have received the help they need to adapt to their changed circumstances and to resume their contributions to our society. Today, employers across the Nation are working closely with State rehabilitation agencies to ensure that men and women with disabilities are trained to succeed at the jobs of tomorrow.
Thanks largely to the efforts of people with disabilities, America has come a long way from the time when these citizens were kept out of sight and out of mind. Today, our Nation's disability policies emphasize inclusion, independence, and empowerment. Our laws declare that Americans with disabilities have a fundamental right to full equality--and are entitled to the same choices and opportunities as their fellow citizens who are not disabled.
But we still have a long way to travel before we reach our goal of full equality in fact as well as in law. Today, two-thirds of all persons with disabilities remain unemployed, although many of them already have received appropriate training and rehabilitative services. And even more distressing, millions of these individuals would find it difficult to work if a job were offered to them simply because our society has not instituted the changes needed to help them perform their work responsibilities.
People with disabilities want to work, and it is vital that we offer them the means to gain full employment. Not only is this the right thing to do, it is the prudent thing as well. If America is to continue to succeed in our rapidly changing global economy, we cannot afford to waste the talents, knowledge, vision, or abilities of a single individual.
Let us celebrate National Rehabilitation Week by rededicating ourselves to the spirit of equality. As we move toward the era of hope and opportunity promised by the 21st century, we must guarantee that every American has a share in that hope and ensure that the doors of opportunity are open to all. By empowering each person, including

PROCLAMATION 6825--SEPT. 16, 1995

NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United

Proclamation 6825 of September 16, 1995
Citizenship Day and Constitution Week, 1995
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Americans, unlike many other peoples, are linked to one another neither by the confines of geography nor by centuries of tradition. Instead, we base our citizenship on a foundation of shared ideals and ideas, bringing gifts from every country, race, and culture. Those whose ancestors came to these shores long ago and first-generation immigrants alike--all are bound by the unique set of principles set forth in the documents that established and continue to define this Nation.
We find our heritage in profound words: in the declaration that all men are created equal, endowed with unalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; in the invitation of liberty extended to the tired, the poor, the huddled masses yearning to breathe free; and in the pledge to remain one Nation, under God, with liberty and justice for all.
Perhaps the greatest expression of our national identity is the United States Constitution. Adopted on September 17, 1787, the Constitution describes the parameters of our Government and the rights and responsibilities that accompany American citizenship. From its phrases we derive our precious rights to free expression and religious liberty, and we assume the responsibilities of electing our leaders and participating in the workings of government.
Yet the genius of the Constitution is not simply in forming "a more perfect Union," but in framing an ideal and providing a means for progress toward its realization. As Abraham Lincoln once stated, our Founding Fathers "meant to set up a standard maxim for free society, which should be familiar to all, and revered by all; constantly looked to, constantly labored for, and even though never perfectly attained, constantly approximated, and thereby constantly spreading and deep-

109 STAT. 1832 PROCLAMATION 6826--SEPT. 21, 1995
ening its influence, and augmenting the happiness and value of life to all people of all colors everywhere."
Indeed, this bold experiment in self-government has inspired more than 200 years of striving for true justice and freedom. From the beginning, there was a dissonance between the plain meaning of our creed and the reality of American life, and constitutional history reflects the vital changes wrought by amendments, civil war, and tremendous social transformations. Emancipation, women's suffrage, civil rights, voting rights--all these began as the struggles of citizens who joined together to push our Nation toward the ideals enshrined in our Constitution and whose efforts were encouraged by the Constitution itself.
In honor of the paramount importance of the Constitution in setting forth the fundamental doctrines of our country and in recognition of the role each American must play in bringing these words to life, the Congress, by joint resolution of February 29, 1952 (36 U.S.C. 153), designated September 17 as "Citizenship Day," and by joint resolution of August 2, 1956 (36 U.S.C. 159), requested the President to proclaim the week beginning September 17 and ending September 23 of each year as "Constitution Week."
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim September 17, 1995, as Citizenship Day and September 17 through September 23, 1995, as Constitution Week. I call upon Federal, State, and local officials, as well as leaders of civic, educational, and religious organizations, to conduct meaningful ceremonies and programs in their schools, churches, and other community gathering places to foster a better understanding of the Constitution and the rights and duties of citizenship.
I further call upon the officials of the Government to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on September 17, 1995, in honor of Citizenship Day.

National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week, 1995
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Just after the turn of the century, George Washington Carver, teacher, scientist, and intellectual leader at Tuskegee Institute, wrote, "Education is the key to unlock the golden door of freedom." His words ring true for all Americans, but especially so for the students of our Nation's historically black colleges and universities. These institutions are a beacon of hope, a path to advancement, and a source of pride for African Americans and for everyone who values higher learning.
Founded on a commitment to equal opportunity and academic excellence, historically black colleges and universities have enabled countless members of our society to receive a quality education and to pursue their goals and careers. In every sector of our diverse and vibrant country--^business, law, academia, medicine, science, the arts, and the military--graduates of these schools have made outstanding contributions to our Nation's progress.
These distinguished institutions have long provided a bridge to the American Dream for their alrnnni--^many of whom are the first in their families to graduate from college. And while nearly all of America's 103 historically black colleges and universities are located in the South, our entire Nation has benefited from their legacy. Indeed, 27 percent of all baccalaureate degrees awarded to African Americans are granted by these schools, which represent only 3 percent of America's institutions of higher education.
It is their commitment to academic rigor and their dedication to empowering the minority community that have enabled historically black colleges and universities to build a proud tradition of excellence in this country. As centers of independent thought, black colleges hold out a promise to the young leaders of tomorrow--a promise that our Nation will continue to grow in wisdom, that the future will hold increased opportunity, and that education will open new doors to hope and prosperity.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 24 through September 30, 1995, as National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week. I call upon the people of the United States, including government officials, educators, and administrators, to observe this week with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities honoring America's black colleges and their graduates, and I encourage all Americans to rededicate themselves to the principles of justice and equality set forth in our Constitution.

Proclamation 6828 of October 2,1995
Child Health Day, 1995
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
In hospitals and homes across the country, children begin life free from the burdens of the world. With their eyes and minds open to every influence, they depend on their caregivers to help them take the first, tentative steps toward adulthood. Parents and other family members, communities and churches, educators and the media--all play a role in these crucial early years, providing young people with the direction they need to become happy, productive citizens.
Tragically, far too many children go without this essential love and guidance, living in homes, neighborhoods, and schools where they see and endure violence. One in five pregnant women is abused by her partner; millions of children each year are reported to public social service agencies as being neglected or abused; and in the decade between 1982 and 1992, the number of these reports increased 132 percent. We know that young men and women suffer lasting effects from such experiences--teen suicides have tripled in the last 35 years, and countless youth have grown up to continue the cycle of destructive behavior in their own relationships and families.
In recognition of these heartbreaking realities, the theme of Child Health Day, 1995, is the elimination of violence. As our Nation observes this special day, let us renew our commitment to America's children and rededicate ourselves to ending the physical and emotional mistreatment that damage self-esteem and well-being. Solutions to the plague of violence lie within our own society, and we can find hope in the partnerships forming among public health and mental health professionals, schools, law enforcement officers, religious groups, child care experts, and community leaders. Their efforts, aided by the extensive Federal network already in place, will help to strengthen families and instill in our young people the ambition and spirit that has always driven America forward.
To emphasize the importance of nurturing children's growth and development from birth to maturity, the Congress, by joint resolution approved May 18, 1928, as amended (36 U.S.C. 143), has called for the designation of the first Monday in October as "Child Health Day" and has requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this day.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Monday, October 2, 1995, as Child Health Day. On this day, and on every day throughout the year, I call upon my fellow Americans to deepen their commitment to protecting children, taking the necessary steps to meet our obligations to them and to our Nation's future.

109 STAT. 1833

As we look upon America's public memorials, we also remember the unseen tributes that dwell in homes and hearts across the country-- the personal mementos and memories treasured by mothers who have lost a child in military service. Our Gold Star Mothers reflect the legacy of their sons' and daughters' bravery and ensure that their children will never be forgotten--^that their courage will inspire new generations.
Watching a beloved child go off to war is one of the hardest things a parent can endure. America's Gold Star Mothers proudly stood this test and suffered the terrible anxiety of waiting for word of their loved ones. Each of these heroic women was also called upon to bear the greatest hardship of all--the cruel truth that her son or daughter would never return.
These mothers gave their most cherished gift so that our Nation could live in liberty and so that people around the globe could be freed from tyranny and oppression. And Gold Star Mothers continue a proud tradition of service, helping veterans with disabilities through voluntary service in VA medical facilities. Bringing comfort to those who suffered for our country. Gold Star Mothers exemplify the gratitude and honor each citizen owes to America's veterans.
This year, the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II, evokes many powerful emotions--pride in victory, sorrow in loss, and hope for a future of world peace. At times such as these, we join with Gold Star Mothers in remembering their children's dedication to duty and their ultimate sacrifice. We pray that these mothers can find solace in knowing that their sons and daughters helped to keep the beacon of peace and freedom burning, lighting the way to a better world.
In recognition of the outstanding courage of our Gold Star Mothers, the Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 115 of June 23, 1936 (49 Stat. 1895), has designated the last Sunday in September as "Gold Star Mother's Day" and has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this day.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim September 24, 1995, as Gold Star Mother's Day. I call upon the American people to observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities that honor our Gold Star Mothers,
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twentieth.

Proclamation 6829 of October 2,1995
National Domestic Violence Awareness Month, 1995
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Domestic violence disrupts communities, destroys relationships, and harms hundreds of thousands of Americans each year. It is a serious crime that takes many forms and a complex problem with multiple causes. Those abused can be children, siblings, spouses, or parents, and both victims and offenders come from all racial, social, religious, ethnic, and economic backgrounds. Among the most tragic effects of family violence is the cycle of abuse perpetuated by children and teenagers who see and experience brutality at home--these young people often lack crucial guidance to help them form strong, positive bonds of kinship.
Americans are fortunate that knowledge about domestic violence has increased and that public interest in deterrence is stronger than ever. During the past decade, vital partnerships have formed between Federal agencies and private-sector organizations to expand prevention services in urban, rural, and underserved areas across the country. These efforts have helped to coordinate aid for victims and their children--not only providing shelter, but also furnishing alcohol and drug abuse treatment, child care, and counseling. In addition, I am proud that the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 contains tough new sanctions and includes a provision for a national "hot line" where victims can receive information and assistance.
But the struggle to end domestic violence is far from over. According to a recent Justice Department study for 1992 and 1993, women were about six times more likely than men to experience violence committed by offenders with whom they had an intimate relationship. And in 1992, nearly 30 percent of all female homicide victims were known to have been killed by husbands, former husbands, or boyfriends. We need more prevention campaigns and public awareness efforts; we must develop and share successful methods of prevention, intervention, and treatment for victims and perpetrators; and we must continue to build alliances among government, community associations, businesses, educators, and religious organizations to strengthen our families and to teach alternatives to violent behavior.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 1995, as "National Domestic Violence Awareness Month." I call upon government officials, law enforcement agencies, health professionals, educators, and the people of the United States to join together to end

PROCLAMATION 6830--OCT. 4, 1995

the family violence that threatens so many citizens. I further encourage all Americans to recognize the dedication of those working to end the horrors of abuse. Offering support, guidance, encouragement, and compassion to survivors, these caring individuals exemplify our Nation's highest ideals of service and citizenship.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twentieth.

Proclamation 6830 of October 4,1995
Energy Awareness Month, 1995
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Although we tend to focus on energy issues only in times of crisis, Americans should not underestimate the daily impact of a clean, safe, affordable energy supply on maintaining our standard of living, protecting the environment, and ensuring our national defense. In the past 3 decades alone, disruptions in global oil markets and dramatic price shocks have caused international strife and economic recession. Energy choices affect air and water pollution; nuclear, toxic, and other waste disposal present potential hazards; and energy use can influence our precious wilderness and natural ecosystems.
As we observe Energy Awareness Month, 1995, this year's theme, "Energy Fuels Our Future," is a powerful reminder of the need to build a strong foundation of sustainable energy policies that will benefit the generations to come. We can be proud of the United States' efforts toward this end. In every critical sector of society--commercial and residential development, transportation, industry, utility management, and government--we have improved efficiency and reduced the environmental impact of energy production and consumption.
Our challenge today is to continue this work, and my Administration remains committed to the responsible use of existing resources and the progress of innovative technology. We have many objectives--enhancing the competitiveness of our Nation's oil producers, expanding the role of domestically produced natural gas, encouraging the development of renewable energy resources, minimizing the environmental impact of coal use, and supervising the safe contribution of nuclear energy. As we seek to strengthen our economy and ease the burden of energy use on the global environment, let us work together toward these vital goals.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the LFnited States, do hereby proclaim October 1995 as "Energy Awareness Month." I call upon government officials, educators, and all the people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate activities recognizing the central importance of energy use in our lives and to the future of our world.

Proclamation 6828 of October 2,1995
Child Health Day, 1995
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
In hospitals and homes across the country, children begin life free from the burdens of the world. With their eyes and minds open to every influence, they depend on their caregivers to help them take the first, tentative steps toward adulthood. Parents and other family members, communities and churches, educators and the media--all play a role in these crucial early years, providing young people with the direction they need to become happy, productive citizens.
Tragically, far too many children go without this essential love and guidance, living in homes, neighborhoods, and schools where they see and endure violence. One in five pregnant women is abused by her partner; millions of children each year are reported to public social service agencies as being neglected or abused; and in the decade between 1982 and 1992, the number of these reports increased 132 percent. We know that young men and women suffer lasting effects from such experiences--teen suicides have tripled in the last 35 years, and countless youth have grown up to continue the cycle of destructive behavior in their own relationships and families.
In recognition of these heartbreaking realities, the theme of Child Health Day, 1995, is the elimination of violence. As our Nation observes this special day, let us renew our commitment to America's children and rededicate ourselves to ending the physical and emotional mistreatment that damage self-esteem and well-being. Solutions to the plague of violence lie within our own society, and we can find hope in the partnerships forming among public health and mental health professionals, schools, law enforcement officers, religious groups, child care experts, and community leaders. Their efforts, aided by the extensive Federal network already in place, will help to strengthen families and instill in our young people the ambition and spirit that has always driven America forward.
To emphasize the importance of nurturing children's growth and development from birth to maturity, the Congress, by joint resolution approved May 18, 1928, as amended (36 U.S.C. 143), has called for the designation of the first Monday in October as "Child Health Day" and has requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this day.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Monday, October 2, 1995, as Child Health Day. On this day, and on every day throughout the year, I call upon my fellow Americans to deepen their commitment to protecting children, taking the necessary steps to meet our obligations to them and to our Nation's future.

Proclamation 6831 of October 5,1995
National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, 1995
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Our Nation can take pride in the progress we have made in the war against breast cancer. Many patients who would have confronted prolonged suffering and tragic death just a few years ago can now weigh options for treatment and face the future with excellent chances for recovery. My Administration has made a strong commitment to ending breast cancer's threat to the health of American women, significantly increasing funding for research, launching a campaign to encourage older women to take advantage of the mammography covered by Medicare, and creating a National Action Plan on Breast Cancer. This initiative unites the Federal Government, advocacy groups, health professionals, and private industries in a dynamic partnership to develop new strategies for prevention and care.
Yet even as we celebrate these gains, we must remember that millions of American women still fight this terrible disease, and tens of thousands die each year as a result of its devastating effects. Every three minutes another woman is diagnosed, and breast cancer claims some 120 precious lives daily. It is the most common form of cancer among women in this country and the leading cause of cancer death for those aged 30 to 54. And all women--our mothers, sisters, daughters, and friends--face the same stark statistics.
If we are to protect our citizens and honor the memories of the brave women who, like my mother, lost their lives to breast cancer, we must rededicate ourselves to the final eradication of the illness. Although there is no known cure, early detection and advances in medical technology remain our best weapons. By doing routine self-examinations, undergoing regular mammograms, and keeping a schedule of preventive medical care, women can detect breast tumors early and dramatically reduce the spread of cancer. This month and throughout the year, let us work to increase awareness of these lifesaving therapies and renew our commitment to developing new means of prevention.
NOW, THEREFORE. I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 1995 as National Breast Cancer Awareness Month. I urge the people of the United States to learn more about breast cancer and the resources we have--including examinations, mammography, good nutrition, and exercise--that may prevent its occurrence and minimize its spread. During this month, I call upon every citizen to extend special compas-

Proclamation 6832 of October 6,1995
National Disability Employment Awareness Month, 1995
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
"The strongest bond . . . outside of the family relation, should be one uniting all working people, of all nations, and tongues, and kindreds." Although written more than a century ago, Abraham Lincoln's words continue to express the ability of common pm-pose to transcend boundaries. As our Nation prepares for a new century and faces the demands of an increasingly global marketplace, this idea is more important than ever. We are called upon to value every citizen's unique gifts and to encourage all people to participate in moving our Nation forward.
America's employees with disabilities have long been a part of this effort, distinguishing themselves in virtually every occupation and profession. Indeed, study after study has shown that workers with disabilities perform as well as, or better than, other members of the labor force on every factor measured. The typical cost of accommodating a person with a disability on the job is only $200, and this investment is amply repaid--wage earners with disabilities increase productivity and tax revenue, become consumers of goods and services, and reduce the burden on government welfare and entitlement programs.
Yet despite their many contributions and successes, individuals with disabilities remain underrepresented in our Nation's work force. Fully two-thirds of all Americans of working age with severe disabilities are unemployed, though research indicates that two-thirds of that number want to work. We cannot allow this situation to continue, but must unite in a concerted effort to ensure that all people with disabilities have the opportunity to be integral, productive members of oiu" society. Together, our Nation's employers and citizens with disabilities can form an unbeatable team equipped to advance an interest vital to our country--a sound and growing economy.
To recognize the tremendous potential of individuals with disabilities and to encourage all Americans to work toward their integration and full inclusion in the work force, the Congress, by joint resolution, approved August 11, 1945, as amended (36 U,S,C, 155), has designated October of each year as "National Disability Employment Awareness Month,"
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim October 1995 as National Disability Employment Awareness Month. I call upon government offi-

same notes. Whatever cultural tradition is evoked by its cords and rhythms, classical music stirs emotions we all share. Among the many music lovers gathered to enjoy a performance, each individual listener feels the powerful dynamism of music's resonant voice.
This month, let us celebrate the artistic excellence that brings classical music to life. We honor the many remarkable composers, conductors, and performers of the past whose works continue to delight us, and we applaud today's musicians, whose talents remind us of the continuity and grandeur of the humfm experience. Each has contributed to the vast body of music that entertains and inspires people around the globe.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 1995, as "Classical Music Month." I call upon government officials, educators, community organizations, and all the people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities paying tribute to the extraordinary diversity and artistry of classical music.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninetyfive, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twentieth.

Proclamation 6821 of September 12,1995
To Establish a Tariff-Rate Quota on Certain Tobacco, Eliminate Tariffs on Certain Other Tobacco, and for Other Purposes
By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation
1. (a) On April 15, 1994, I entered into trade agreements resulting from the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations ("the Uruguay Round Agreements"), including the Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization ("the WTO Agreement") and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 ("the GATT 1994"), annexed to the WTO Agreement. In section 101(a) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act ("the URAA") (Public Law 103-465, 108 Stat. 4814)(19 U.S.C. 3511(a)), the United States approved the Uruguay Round Agreements. These agreements entered into force for the United States on January 1, 1995.
(b) Section 125(c) of the Trade Act of 1974 ("the 1974 Act")(19 U.S.C, 2135(c)) provides that whenever the United States, acting in pursuance of any of its rights or obligations under any trade agreement entered into pursuant to the 1974 Act, modifies any obligation with respect to the trade of any foreign country or instrumentality, the President is authorized to proclaim increased duties or other import restrictions, to the extent, at such times, and for such periods as he deems

109 STAT. 1814 PROCLAMATION 6821--SEPT. 12, 1995
necessary or appropriate, in order to exercise the rights or fulfill the obligations of the United States. Section 421 of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 2135 note) authorizes the President, pursuant to the 1974 Act, to proclaim an increase in any existing duty on certain tobacco to a rate no more than 50 percent above the rate that was set forth in rate column numbered 2 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States, as in effect on January 1, 1975, or no more than 350 percent ad valorem above the rate existing on January 1, 1975, whichever is higher.
(c) Section 1105(a) of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 ("the 1988 Act")(19 U.S.C. 2904(a)) provides that for purposes of applying section 125 of the 1974 Act, any trade agreement entered into under section 1102 of the 1988 Act (19 U.S.C. 2902) shall be treated as an agreement entered into under section 101 or 102, as appropriate, of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2111 and 2112), and any proclamation issued pursuant to such a trade agreement shall be treated as a proclamation issued pursuant to a trade agreement entered into under section 102 of the 1974 Act.
(d) The United States, acting pursuant to its rights and obligations under the Uruguay Round Agreements, in particular Article XXVIII of the GATT 1994, is modifying its obligations with respect to the tariff treatment of certain tobacco to establish a tariff-rate quota for imports of such tobacco.
(e) Accordingly, I have determined that it is appropriate to proclaim the tariff modifications set forth in Annex I to this proclamation in order to exercise the rights and fulfill the obligations of the United States under the Uruguay Round Agreements. These modifications would, among other things, establish a tariff-rate quota for imports of certain tobacco.
2. (a) Section 423 of the URAA (19 U.S.C. 3621) authorizes the President to proclaim the reduction or elimination of any duty with respect to cigar binder and filler tobacco, wrapper tobacco, or oriental tobacco set forth in Schedule XX--United States of America, annexed to the Marrakesh Protocol to the GATT 1994 ("Schedule XX").
(b) I have decided to proclaim the elimination of the duties on cigar binder and filler tobacco, wrapper tobacco, and oriental tobacco, as set forth in Annex I to this proclamation.
3. (a) Section 422(c) of the URAA (7 U.S.C. 1445 note) authorizes the President to waive the application to imported tobacco of section 106(g) of the Agricultural Act of 1949 (7 U.S.C. 1445(g)) if the President determines that the waiver is necessary or appropriate pursuant to an international agreement entered into by the United States.
(b) I have determined that it is necessary or appropriate pursuant to the Uruguay Round Agreements to waive the application of section 106(g) of the Agricultural Act of 1949 to imports of cigar tobacco. This waiver shall take effect on the effective date of this proclamation.
4. Presidential Proclamation No. 6641 of December 15, 1993, which implemented the North American Free Trade Agreement ("the NAFTA") with respect to the United States, established a tariff heading in chapter 98 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedules of the United States ("the HTS") for certain textile and apparel goods assembled in Mexico from fabric wholly formed and cut in the United States. This tariff heading, 9802.00.90, inadvertently narrowed the scope of the agreed

PROCLAMATION 6821--SEPT. 12, 1995 109 STAT. 1815
duty-free treatment, as set forth in Appendix 2.4 to Annex 300-B to the NAFTA. I have decided that it is necessary and appropriate to modify heading 9802.00.90 to the HTS to align it with the provisions of the NAFTA, pursuant to section 201(a)(1) of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (Public Law 103-182, 107 Stat. 2057)(19 U.S.C. 3331(a)(1)).
5. (a) The March 9, 1994, Memorandum of Understanding on the Results of the Uruguay Round Negotiations on Agriculture Between the United States of America and Uruguay and the March 24, 1994, Memorandum of Understanding on the Results of the Uruguay Round Market Access Negotiations on Agriculture Between the United States of America and Argentina ("the MOUs") were submitted to the Congress along with the Uruguay Round Agreements. Each MOU provides that, once the appropriate Department of Agriculture authorities approve the country to ship fresh, chilled or frozen beef to the United States, the in-quota quantity of the United States tariff-rate quota for beef will be increased by 20,000 metric tons, and that increase will be allocated to that country.
(b) Section 404(d)(4) of the URAA (19 U.S.C. 3601(d)(4)) authorizes the President to proclaim an increase in the in-quota quantity of the tariff-rate quota for beef if the President determines that an increase is necessary to implement either MOU.
(c) Accordingly, pursuant to section 404(d)(4) of the URAA, I have determined that it is necessary to proclaim an increase in the in-quota quantity of the tariff-rate quota for beef as set forth in Annex II to this proclamation, to be effective for each country upon the dates specified therein.
6. Presidential Proclamation No. 6763 of December 23, 1994, implemented the Uruguay Round Agreements, including Schedule XX, with respect to the United States and incorporated in the HTS tariff modifications necessary and appropriate to carry out the Uruguay Round Agreements. Certain technical errors, including inadvertent omissions and typographical errors, were made in that proclamation. I have decided that, in order to reflect accurately the intended tariff treatment provided for in the Uruguay Round Agreements, it is necessary to modify certain provisions of the HTS, as set forth in Annex II to this proclamation.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of tlie United States, including but not limited to section 301 of title 3, United States Code, section 125 of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2135), sections 421, 422(c) and 423 of the URAA (19 U.S.C. 2135 note, 7 U.S.C. 1445 note, and 19 U.S.C. 3621, respectively), and section 604 of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2483), do hereby proclaim:
(1) In order to exercise the rights and fulfill the obligations of the United States under the WTO Agreement, the HTS is modified as set forth in Annex I to this proclamation.
(2) The provisions of Annex I to this proclamation shall take effect with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the dates specified in such annex.

WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 6834 of October 6,1995
German-American Day, 1995
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Since the earliest days of the settlement of North America, immigrants from Germany have enriched our Nation with their industry, culture, and participation in public life. Over a quarter of all Americans can trace their ancestry back to German roots, but more important than numbers are the motives that led so many Germans to make a new beginning across the Atlantic. America's unparalleled freedoms and opportimities drew the first German immigrants to our shores and have long inspired the tremendous contributions that German Americans have made to our heritage.
In 1681, William Penn invited German Pietists from the Rhine valley to settle in the Quaker colony he had founded, and these Germans were among the first of many who would immigrate to America in search of religious freedom. This Nation also welcomed Germans in search of civic liberty, and their idealism strengthened what was best in their adopted country. As publisher of the New York Weekly Journal in the 1700s, Johann Peter Zenger became one of the founders of the free press. Carl Schurz, a political dissident and close ally of Abraham Lincoln, served as a Union General during the Civil War, fighting to end the oppression of slavery. And German names figured prominently in the social and labor reform movements of the 19th and early 20th centuries.
In the course of 300 years of German emigration to this great land, German Americans have attained prominence in all areas of our national life. Like Baron von Steuben in Revolutionary times and General Eisenhower in World War II, many Americans of German descent have served in our military with honor and distinction. In the sciences, Albert Michelson and Hans Bethe immeasurably increased our understanding of the universe. The painters Albert Bierstadt and modernist Josef Albers have enhanced our artistic traditions, and composers such as Oscar Hammerstein have added their important influences to American music.
Yet even these many distinguished names cannot begin to summarize all the gifts that German Americans have brought to our Nation's history. While parts of the Midwest, Pennsylvania, and Texas still proudly bear the stamp of the large German populations of the last century, it is their widespread assimilation and far-reaching activities that have earned German Americans a distinguished reputation in all regions of the United States and in all walks of life.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 6,

109 STAT. 1842

PROCLAMATION 6835--OCT. 6, 1995

1995, as German-American Day. I encourage Americans everywhere to recognize and celebrate the contributions that milHons of people of German ancestry have made to our Nation's liberty, democracy, and prosperity.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twentieth.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 6835 of October 6,1995
National School Lunch Week, 1995
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
On June 4, 1946, President Truman signed the National School Lunch Act--landmark legislation designed to ensure the nutritional health of America's students. This year, nearly half a century later, the Department of Agriculture has updated Federal regulations to require school meals to meet the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The resulting School Meals Initiative for Healthy Children is the most significant reform of the meals program since President Truman's time, underscoring our Nation's profound responsibility to protect our children's wellbeing.
Recognizing that simply adopting policies does not always guarantee change, my Administration launched Team Nutrition on June 12, 1995, to unite public and private organizations in promoting healthful dietary habits through schools, community organizations, and the media. This groundbreaking measure also provides the training, technical assistance, and nutrition education that are critical to the School Meals Initiative's successful implementation. This fall marks the introduction of the Team Nutrition Schools Program, which brings together teachers and principals, children and families, community leaders, and school food services professionals to work for healthier school meals and to make available better nutrition information.
The National School Lunch program currently operates in more than 95 percent of our Nation's public schools and serves some 25 million students daily. The only nutritious meal of the day for many children, a school lunch can help to lengthen attention span, increase learning capacity, and dramatically improve overall health. Thanks to dedicated educators, parents. Federal, State, and local officials, and particularly food service professionals, more than 92,000 schools and residential child care institutions across the country provide wholesome meals to our Nation's children, enabling them to look forward to a healthier future.
In recognition of the contributions of the National School Lunch program to the nutritional well-being of our young people, the Congress, by joint resolution of October 9, 1962 (Public Law 87-780), has designated the week beginning the second Sunday in October of each year

109 STAT. 1840

cials, educators, and the people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate programs and activities that reaffirm our determination to fulfill both the letter and the spirit of the Americans with Disabilities Act,
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twentieth.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 6833 of October 6,1995
National Children's Day, 1995
By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation
All who have welcomed a child to the world can appreciate the sentiments of Ralph Waldo Emerson who wrote, "We find a delight in the beauty and happiness of children, that makes the heart too big for the body." Worthy of our deepest love and this Nation's most profound concern, children represent our dearest hopes for the future. We must ensure that they receive the care, protection, and guidance each child so richly deserves.
Millions of American children are fortunate to grow up in stable, affectionate families where they enjoy loving support. Yet far too many children lack this essential foundation, and countless young people suffer the terrible effects of hunger, poverty, neglect, and abuse. Today's families are plagued with problems that hinder their ability to tend to their children's well-being. Drug and alcohol addiction, physical and emotional violence, stress, and economic hardship all take a devastating toll.
Every one of us must take responsibility for reversing these alarming trends and for ensuring that all of our children have the opportunity to become vital, productive citizens. By getting involved now, we can reinforce the efforts of schools, churches, communities, and neighborhood organizations to strengthen families and to provide security and structure in our children's lives. Remembering that today's children will be tomorrow's leaders, educators, and parents, let us help them to look forward with hope and enthusiasm for the future.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim October 8, 1995, as National Children's Day, I urge the American people to express their love and appreciation for children on this day and on every day throughout the year. I invite Federal officials, local governments, communities, and particularly all American families to join together in observing this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities that honor our Nation's children.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-five.

Proclamation 6832 of October 6,1995
National Disability Employment Awareness Month, 1995
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
"The strongest bond . . . outside of the family relation, should be one uniting all working people, of all nations, and tongues, and kindreds." Although written more than a century ago, Abraham Lincoln's words continue to express the ability of common pm-pose to transcend boundaries. As our Nation prepares for a new century and faces the demands of an increasingly global marketplace, this idea is more important than ever. We are called upon to value every citizen's unique gifts and to encourage all people to participate in moving our Nation forward.
America's employees with disabilities have long been a part of this effort, distinguishing themselves in virtually every occupation and profession. Indeed, study after study has shown that workers with disabilities perform as well as, or better than, other members of the labor force on every factor measured. The typical cost of accommodating a person with a disability on the job is only $200, and this investment is amply repaid--wage earners with disabilities increase productivity and tax revenue, become consumers of goods and services, and reduce the burden on government welfare and entitlement programs.
Yet despite their many contributions and successes, individuals with disabilities remain underrepresented in our Nation's work force. Fully two-thirds of all Americans of working age with severe disabilities are unemployed, though research indicates that two-thirds of that number want to work. We cannot allow this situation to continue, but must unite in a concerted effort to ensure that all people with disabilities have the opportunity to be integral, productive members of oiu" society. Together, our Nation's employers and citizens with disabilities can form an unbeatable team equipped to advance an interest vital to our country--a sound and growing economy.
To recognize the tremendous potential of individuals with disabilities and to encourage all Americans to work toward their integration and full inclusion in the work force, the Congress, by joint resolution, approved August 11, 1945, as amended (36 U,S,C, 155), has designated October of each year as "National Disability Employment Awareness Month,"
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim October 1995 as National Disability Employment Awareness Month. I call upon government offi-

Proclamation 6833 of October 6,1995
National Children's Day, 1995
By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation
All who have welcomed a child to the world can appreciate the sentiments of Ralph Waldo Emerson who wrote, "We find a delight in the beauty and happiness of children, that makes the heart too big for the body." Worthy of our deepest love and this Nation's most profound concern, children represent our dearest hopes for the future. We must ensure that they receive the care, protection, and guidance each child so richly deserves.
Millions of American children are fortunate to grow up in stable, affectionate families where they enjoy loving support. Yet far too many children lack this essential foundation, and countless young people suffer the terrible effects of hunger, poverty, neglect, and abuse. Today's families are plagued with problems that hinder their ability to tend to their children's well-being. Drug and alcohol addiction, physical and emotional violence, stress, and economic hardship all take a devastating toll.
Every one of us must take responsibility for reversing these alarming trends and for ensuring that all of our children have the opportunity to become vital, productive citizens. By getting involved now, we can reinforce the efforts of schools, churches, communities, and neighborhood organizations to strengthen families and to provide security and structure in our children's lives. Remembering that today's children will be tomorrow's leaders, educators, and parents, let us help them to look forward with hope and enthusiasm for the future.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim October 8, 1995, as National Children's Day, I urge the American people to express their love and appreciation for children on this day and on every day throughout the year. I invite Federal officials, local governments, communities, and particularly all American families to join together in observing this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities that honor our Nation's children.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-five.

Proclamation 6835 of October 6,1995
National School Lunch Week, 1995
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
On June 4, 1946, President Truman signed the National School Lunch Act--landmark legislation designed to ensure the nutritional health of America's students. This year, nearly half a century later, the Department of Agriculture has updated Federal regulations to require school meals to meet the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The resulting School Meals Initiative for Healthy Children is the most significant reform of the meals program since President Truman's time, underscoring our Nation's profound responsibility to protect our children's wellbeing.
Recognizing that simply adopting policies does not always guarantee change, my Administration launched Team Nutrition on June 12, 1995, to unite public and private organizations in promoting healthful dietary habits through schools, community organizations, and the media. This groundbreaking measure also provides the training, technical assistance, and nutrition education that are critical to the School Meals Initiative's successful implementation. This fall marks the introduction of the Team Nutrition Schools Program, which brings together teachers and principals, children and families, community leaders, and school food services professionals to work for healthier school meals and to make available better nutrition information.
The National School Lunch program currently operates in more than 95 percent of our Nation's public schools and serves some 25 million students daily. The only nutritious meal of the day for many children, a school lunch can help to lengthen attention span, increase learning capacity, and dramatically improve overall health. Thanks to dedicated educators, parents. Federal, State, and local officials, and particularly food service professionals, more than 92,000 schools and residential child care institutions across the country provide wholesome meals to our Nation's children, enabling them to look forward to a healthier future.
In recognition of the contributions of the National School Lunch program to the nutritional well-being of our young people, the Congress, by joint resolution of October 9, 1962 (Public Law 87-780), has designated the week beginning the second Sunday in October of each year

PROCLAMATION 6836--OCT. 6, 1995

109 STAT. 1843

as "National School Lunch Week" and has requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of that week.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim October 8 through October 14, 1995, as National School Lunch Week. I call upon all Americans to recognize those individuals whose efforts contribute to the success of our national meals programs, and I encourage people everywhere to reaffirm their commitment to safeguarding children's health.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twentieth.

Proclamation 6836 of October 6,1995
Columbus Day, 1995
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
To pursue ambitious goals and to realize great dreams, we must be willing to venture away from the familiar and comfortable. We must show the strength of our convictions to tackle the challenges, known and unknown, that stand between us and our hopes for the future.
Today, Christopher Columbus' extraordinary journeys stand as inspiring examples of such determination. This renowned explorer braved the open sea, so feared by his contemporaries, and revealed the splendors of the New World to Renaissance Europe over 500 years ago. He discovered the best use of the North Atlantic wind system, first described the Equatorial Current, and initiated the succeeding rapid exploration and settlement of the Americas.
During the course of his first transatlantic voyage, Columbus' bold convictions overcame the resistance of the faint-hearted members of his crew. He led them to the Canaries, the Bahama Islands, Cuba, and Haiti, and subsequent sailings took him to other Caribbean islands. Central America, and Venezuela. As with many pioneers throughout history, Columbus' limited understanding of other cultures led to conflicts and controversies--struggles similar to those that challenge our world even now. But the enduring fame of his travels and the opportunity he sought across uncharted waters remain a call to all who seek adventure,
A native of Genoa, Columbus' courage and commitment led him to leave safe shores in pursuit of his goals. But he could not have made his trips without the support of the Spanish crown. People of Italian and Spanish descent continue to energize communities across our Nation, enhancing every occupation and sector of American society. We are grateful for their tremendous contributions and for the ingenuity of spirit that is Columbus' enduring legacy.
In tribute to Columbus' many achievements, the Congress, by joint resolution of April 30, 1934 (48 Stat. 657), and an Act of June 28, 1968

Leif Erikson Day, 1995
By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation
Every October, we celebrate Leif Erikson Day and honor the memory of that great Norse explorer who first set foot on North American soil nearly a millennium ago. At a time when mankind has traveled from pole to pole and even journeyed into the vast reaches of space, Leif Erikson's bold determination stands as an early example of the spirit of adventure and enterprise.
This day is an occasion to celebrate the bonds of friendship that link the United States to the Nordic countries. For generations, Iceland and her neighbors have acted as bridges between Europe and North America, playing a vital role in fostering democracy and free trade throughout the world. Nordic peoples have long shared America's love of liberty and have always reached out to those who struggle against oppression. Today, we in the United States are proud to work with our Northern friends to fully reintegrate the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania into the Western family of nations. Together we look forward to a new Europe, united by a common respect for liberty and equality.
We should also mark this observance by recognizing the outstanding contributions that citizens of Danish, Finnish, Icelandic, Norwegian, and Swedish descent have made to our country. Just as their ancestors did before them, Nordic Americans cherish their ties across the ocean and bring their many gifts to America's culture, progress, and prosperity. As we remember Leif Erikson, whose voyage preceded so many rugged immigrants who braved the North Atlantic in search of economic, political, and religious liberties, let us pay tribute to his courage and renew our commitment to freedom.
In honor of Leif Erikson--son of Iceland, grandson of Norway--the Congress, by joint resolution approved on September 2, 1964 (Public Law 88-566), has authorized and requested the President to designate October 9 of each year as "Leif Erikson Day."

Proclamation 6838 of October 7,1995
Fire Prevention Week, 1995
By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation
Since 1925, Americans have paused every October to consider the importance of learning how to prevent fires. By observing Fire Prevention Week, our Nation comes together to remember those lost tragically in fire-related incidents, to recognize the terrible damage that fire has caused over the years, and to renew our efforts to learn more about the ways in which we can protect ourselves from fire's devastation.
Some 4,000 people in the United States die from fire each year--a number that can be reduced dramatically through prevention measures. Fires in the home take the biggest toll, with 80 percent of fatalities occurring just where we often feel the safest. Recognizing that cooking and heating equipment cause the majority of home fires, the National Fire Protection Association has selected "Watch What You Heat: Prevent Home Fires" as the Fire Prevention Week theme for 1995, joining with the Federal Emergency Management Agency's U.S. Fire Administration to communicate this lifesaving message.
This year's safety campaign teaches essential prevention techniques-- the necessity of staying in the kitchen while cooking and never leaving a lighted stove unattended; of closely supervising all heating equipment, such as portable and space heaters; and of monitoring all appliances and smoking materials. Most important, no matter how careful we are, we must always be prepared by maintaining working smoke detectors throughout our homes.
As we strive to make fire prevention a priority in every American community, we also celebrate the dedication of our Nation's fire and emergency workers--champions of fire safety at the local level. Too often, these brave men and women pay the ultimate price for their faithful service. Last year alone, 100 firefighters died in the line of duty, and more than 95,400 were injured. On Sunday, October 15, 1995, we will pay our respects to these heroic individuals at the 14th annual National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Service at the National Emergency Training Center in Emmitsburg, Maryland. To honor their courageous work, let us rededicate ourselves to building a better, safer world for the generations to come.

General Pulaski Memorial Day, 1995
By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation
October 11 marks the anniversary of the death of General Casimir Pulaski, an American and Polish hero whose devotion to the cause of freedom led him to our shores to fight in the War for Independence and, finally, to give his life during the siege of Savannah. Each year, people around the Nation honor this great man, remembering that his courage and unwavering principles helped to make our country free.
It was General Pulaski's love of liberty that inspired his battle against oppression--first in his native Poland and then in America. With exceptional valor and military skill, he commanded soldiers of the Continental Army in several important contests of the Revolutionary War. And on this day in 1779, General Pulaski made the ultimate sacrifice so that democracy and self-government might triumph.
The annals of Poland and America contain many accounts of bravery, nobility, and service, and Casimir Pulaski occupies a prominent place in the hearts and histories of both countries. Thanks to the struggles and sacrifices of the men and women who have followed his proud example, Poland today is peaceful, free, and increasingly prosperous.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 11, 1995, as General Pulaski Memorial Day. I encourage all Americans to commemorate this occasion with appropriate ceremonies and activities paying tribute to the legacy of General Casimir Pulaski and honoring all those who carry on his mission.

National Character Counts Week, 1995

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
The children of today will be tomorrow's leaders, educators, caregivers, and parents. As we seek to prepare our Nation for the challenges of the future, we must reaffirm America's deepest beliefs and instill in our youth the principles of opportunity, responsibility, and community that have always united our citizens. Emphasizing both individual and social duties, character education helps us toward that goal and reminds us that our country's strength has long been drawn from fundamental ideas.
Families have always held the primary obligation for teaching values to their children. Schools, too, play a vital role in reinforcing the basic precepts of good citizenship--fairness and honesty, respect for oneself and for others, and personal accountability. My Administration's education agenda is dedicated to raising standards for academics and discipline so that young people will have the essential tools they need to succeed. Our Goals 2000: Educate America Act embraces the importance of parental involvement in the learning process, recognizing that family participation encourages children to value scholarship and to adopt strong values. Character education programs can increase school performance as well, and the Improving America's Schools Act promotes such initiatives.
As Americans, we are called upon to fulfill the obligations of citizenship in many ways. As our Nation observes this special week, let us remember our responsibilities to children and do everything in our power to inspire in them the moral and ethical standards that will, in turn, help them to become productive, integral members of our society.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 15 through October 21, 1995, as National Character Counts Week.

White Cane Safety Day, 1995

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
As Americans, we take pride in the diversity that allows us to appreciate the world from many standpoints, and we draw our vitality from the contributions made by people of all experiences, talents, and backgrounds. Long dedicated to the goal of independence, America's blind and visually impaired citizens have enriched our history, inspiring others to join their efforts to further integration and inclusion.
The majority of blind and visually impaired people use the white cane to facilitate their travel. This remarkably simple instrument provides tactile, kinesthetic, and auditory signals to its users, allowing them to detect obstacles, steps up and down, and changes in surface texture. Enhancing motivation and confidence, the white cane has empowered countless blind and visually impaired individuals to gain freedom of movement and to flourish in society. For those of us who are not blind or visually impaired, it signals us to exercise extra caution and to be courteous drivers and pedestrians.
As our Nation observes this special day, the white cane is a symbol of strength and a reminder of the tremendous potential available within each person. We must continue to work for full implementation of the Avmericans With Disabilities Act, which protects people with disabilities from discrimination in the workplace, mandates access to public and private services and accommodations, and promotes equal opportunity. The American Dream is an inspiration to us all--let us work to ensure that every person can realize its promise.
To honor the numerous achievements of blind and visually impaired citizens and to recognize the significance of the white cane in advancing independence, the Congress, by joint resolution approved October 6, 1964, has designated October 15 of each year as "White Cane Safety Day."
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim October 15, 1995, as White Cane Safety Day. I call upon government officials, educators, and all the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.

National Forest Products Week, 1995

By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation
America's forests are a priceless inheritance--one of our country's greatest treasures. From National Forests to State and local parks, from industrial timberlands to privately-owned lots, wooded areas offer us numerous gifts and promise future generations continued benefits. During National Forest Products Week, we renew our commitment to care for our woodlands and to preserve their capacity to sustain themselves.
Providing nutrients and habitat to countless species--including those threatened or endangered--our Nation's forests extend their bounty to mankind as well. Many Americans depend on timberlands for their livelihood; countless people enjoy camping, hiking, and picnicking; and others seek out the woods to find peace and spiritual renewal. In addition, these rich tracts of land produce raw materials for building and other uses and are an essential source of food and medicines derived from trees, shrubs, forbs, fungi, and micro-organisms.
The current state of our forests requires our government, citizens, and the forestry industry to examine past and current forest management practices and to develop new strategies. We are moving toward a new era in stewardship with increased emphasis on forests that are diverse, robust, productive, and sustainable. Understanding that our wooded regions are part of a global mosaic of ecosystems, we must continue to promote public and private environmental responsibility and ensure that our conservation efforts set standards for the world to follow.
In recognition of the central importance of our forests to the welfare of our Nation, the Congress, by Public Law 86-753 (36 U.S.C. 163), has designated the week beginning on the third Sunday in October of each year as "National Forest Products Week" and has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this week.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim October 15 through October 21, 1995, as National Forest Products Week. I call upon the people of the United States to honor the vital role America's forests play in our national life and to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninetyfive, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twentieth.

National Consumers Week, 1995

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Business and trade have always been central to the American experience. In the period since the Industrial Revolution, the extraordinary growth of our economy has created a marketplace that is the foundation of global commerce. Unparalleled natural and human resources have energized every part of our society--from the agricultural heartland that feeds an international community; to the textile and steel mills that began the machine age in America; to the scientific, computer, and information companies that are leading the way into the fast-paced world of the 21st century.
Consumer protections such as fair pricing and product safety rules are more necessary than ever to ensure that all of us are able to fully and fairly participate in a free enterprise system that encourages competition, productivity, and innovation. These protections have evolved alongside the remarkable expansion of the world economy. In 1962, President John F. Kennedy clarified the importance of consumer protection in a Special Message to Congress that has become known as the Consumer Bill of Rights. This statement articulated each person's rights to safety, information, and choice, and the right to be heard in the process of resolving consumer problems. In 1975 President Gerald R. Ford added the right to consumer education.
As the driving force behind the richest, most prosperous country in the world, the United States' free market is a model for others to emulate. We must ensure that our system continues to emphasize the centrality of the consumer even as it becomes increasingly technology-oriented. Accordingly, last year, I was proud to add the latest element to the Consumer Bill of Rights--the right to service--which urges that convenience, courtesy, performance, and responsiveness remain hallmarks of the American marketplace. So that Federal workers and agencies can take the lead in providing high-quality service, my Administration has also initiated the National Performance Review to improve efficiency and promote excellence in every sector of our Government.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 22 through October 28 as National Consumers Week. I call upon Government officials, industry leaders, and the people of the United States to recognize the vital relationship between our economy and our citizenry and to support the right of all Americans to service excellence.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentythird day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twentieth.

United Nations Day, 1995
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Fifty years ago, at the end of the most destructive war the world has ever known, delegates from fifty-one countries met in San Francisco to establish the United Nations. Inspired by a common determination "to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war," the delegates recognized that their vision of a better world could not simply be defined by the absence of conflict, nor could peace be maintained without broad inter-national cooperation. Thus they resolved to "unite our strength to maintain international peace and security," to "promote social progress and better standards of life," and to reaffirm universal human rights.
This year, the U.N., which now numbers 185 member countries, has continued its tradition of promoting peace and security around the globe. Its agencies are important instruments in the campaign to stop the proliferation of nuclear arms and other weapons of mass destruction. It works to provide security for the conduct of free elections. And United Nations troops strive to keep the peace in places of great importance to the United States--on the Kuwait border, in the Mediterranean and in Europe.
We can also be proud of the U.N. agencies and programs that work to support sustainable development, protect the environment, battle the spread of disease, and promote human rights. In fighting the deadly outbreak of the Ebola virus, immunizing millions of children, and securing relief for hundreds of thousands of refugees, agencies like the World Health Organization, UNICEF, and the United Nations High Commissions for Human Rights and Refugees make important contributions to the international community.
The U.N. enters its second half-century of service facing new opportunities and challenges. If the nations of the world are to fully embrace these opportunities and overcome these challenges, we must work more closely together to fully realize the principles of the original United Nations Charter and must commit to improving the organization's efficiency and effectiveness. During this momentous anniversary celebration, let us reaffirm the ideals, principles, and goals contained in the Charter and rededicate ourselves to working for the good of all humankind.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Tuesday, October 24, 1995, as United Nations Day. I encourage all Americans to acquaint themselves with the activities and accomplishments of the U.N. and to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies, programs, and activities furthering the goal of international cooperation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twentythird day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and

I call upon Federal, State, and local officials to display the flag of the United States and to encourage and participate in patriotic activities in their communities. I invite civic and fraternal organizations, places of worship, schools, businesses, unions, and the media to support this national observance with suitable commemorative expressions and programs.

Proclamation 6846 of November 1, 1995
National Adoption Month, 1995
By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation
For many people across the United States, adoption provides a means for building and strengthening families. It places children into loving, permanent homes where they can flourish and grow up to become happy, healthy, productive members of our national community. Adoption also enables adults to experience the unique joys of parenthood.
As many as 70,000 children in America's foster care system may need adoptive families in the next few years--young people of all ages and backgrounds who, for whatever reason, cannot return to their original homes. Many, but not all, are children with special needs. These young people long for the same affection, security, and stability that most of us take for granted, yet too many have waited--and will continue to wait--for years to be adopted.
My Administration has taken important actions to encourage adoption and to support the wonderful families that choose to open their hearts and homes to waiting children. The Multiethnic Placement Act, which I signed into law in October 1994, helps to facilitate adoption for all children and families, regardless of their race or ethnic origin. We will continue to champion and improve programs that break down barriers to adoption through aggressive recruitment of families, financial aid to support placements, and technical assistance to agencies committed to special needs adoption.
As we observe National Adoption Month, we celebrate these achievements and recognize the rewards of adoption, but we must also remember that much work remains to be done. Citizens from all communities and organizations from the public and private sectors must join together to renew our commitment to finding permanent homes for each one of America's children.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the LFnited States, do hereby proclaim November

109 STAT. 1854

Proclamation 6847 of November 2,1995
National American Indian Heritage Month, 1995
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
November is traditionally the season for thanksgiving in America, the time when we reflect on the abundance with which we have been blessed. It is especially fitting, then, that we set aside this month to pause and reflect on the many gifts bestowed on our land and our heritage by American Indians and Alaska Natives.
American Indians have a great reverence for the earth and its bounty, and they generously shared their knowledge and their food with the early European settlers in our country. We still enjoy that harvest today, with an agricultural industry that supports America and the world with the corn, potatoes, beans, cotton, and countless other crops first cultivated on this continent by American Indians.
A second and equally precious gift is that of courage. American Indians and Alaska Natives have fought and died for the United States of America in time of war, answering the call to service to defend our freedoms. The Navajo, Lakota, and Dakota Codetalkers were crucial to our victory in the Pacific during World War II, and it was a Pima Indian, Ira Hayes, who helped to raise the American flag on Iwo Jima. They and so many others have endured separation, hardship, and sacrifice so that the world might know peace.
The gift of wisdom is one that our society has struggled to learn. Living in harmony with nature instead of seeking domination, American Indians have shown us how to be responsible for our environment, to treasure the beauty and resources of the land and water for which we are stewards, and to preserve them for the generations who will come after us. They have taught us as well the value of sharing, of recognizing that there must be room at America's table for all her peoples.
American Indians and Alaska Natives have made invaluable contributions to our common heritage; in every field of human endeavor, from the arts, sciences, and humanities to politics, religion, and public service, they have added immeasurably to the strength of our civilization.
As we celebrate National American Indian Heritage Month, we give thanks for these contributions and acknowledge the special legal relationship that exists between the tribes and the Government of the United States of America.

Proclamation 6845 of October 24,1995
Veterans Day, 1995
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
During both war and peace, America's armed forces have helped to preserve the fundamental rights and liberties guaranteed by our Constitution. Every day, our men and women in uniform maintain an around-the-clock vigil to ensure that our Nation remains safe from harm and our citizens free from fear. Their sacrifices, and the dedication to duty exemplified by American troops throughout our history, have advanced democracy and human dignity around the world.
For generations, brave citizens from every walk of life have answered the call to service, fighting to defend the ideals we hold dear. Through long years of separation and hardship, the selfless contributions made by our veterans have preserved the blessings of freedom. As we honor their heroism, let us also remember the families whose support and prayers have added so much. We owe a heartfelt thanks to all those whose devoted efforts--^both on the battlefield and in communities across the country--have laid the strong foundation of peace and security we enjoy today.
On this 50th anniversary of the end of World War II, we take special pride in recognizing those who served the United States during that terrible conflict--the 16,535,000 men and women who risked their lives to defeat oppression. The ensuing half-century has brought momentous changes in global affairs, and the generation of veterans who triumphed over tyranny continues to hold a sacred place in our national memory.
Veterans of other wars throughout our Nation's history merit no less distinction. There are some 27 million veterans in America today whose service ranges from World War I, through the Cold War, to the Persian Gulf War and our other recent military missions around the globe. Thanks to their loyalty and courage, this country remains a symbol of hope for all those who seek democracy and peace. On Veterans Day and on every day throughout the year, let us remember and honor the sacrifices of our veterans and renew our commitment to accounting for their comrades-in-arms who have fallen, unknown and unrecovered, in distant fields of battle.
In order that we may pay tribute to those who have served in our Armed Forces, the Congress has provided (5 U.S.C. 6103(a)) that November 11 of each year shall be set aside as a day to recognize America's veterans.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Saturday, November 11, 1995, as Veterans Day. I urge all Americans to honor the resolution and com-

Death of Yitzhak Rahin
By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation
Today a senseless act of violence has robbed the United States of a close friend and robbed the world of a statesman and courageous champion of peace.
Yitzhak Rabin was a brave man who defended his country for half a century and whose vision and tenacity brought the world closer to peace.
He was a man of hope, a man of wisdom, a man who sought to improve the lives of all those he touched.
The peace process that he began will be his legacy. The people of the United States and the peace-loving people of the world are determined that the peace process will go forward.
As a mark of respect for the memory of Yitzhak Rabin and America's support for peace in the Middle East, I hereby order that the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff upon all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions until his interment. I also direct that the flag shall be flown at half-staff for the same length of time at all United States Embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities and naval vessels and stations.

National Great American Smokeout Day, 1995
By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation
Children are our Nation's most precious resource and most sacred obligation. And all of us--whether parents or guardians, teachers or coaches, ministers or rabbis, friends or government officials--can play a role in nurturing young people and working to ensure their future health and happiness. Our children look to us for guidance, and we must do all we can to provide them with examples of personal responsibility and good citizenship.
Yet, every day, some 3,000i young Americans become regular smokers, falling victim to negative influences and provocative advertisements and putting themselves at risk of the diseases caused by nicotine addiction. Nearly 1,000 of these children will die prematurely, joining the more than 400,000 Americans who 1OL3 their lives to tobacco-related illnesses each year. For a country so deeply devoted to the protection of children, such numbers are a national tragedy.
Recognizing the vital need to reverse these devastating statistics, my Administration has proposed measures to limit children's access to tobacco products and to reduce tobacco's appeal. In seeking to protect our children, we join the countless caring citizens who are observing the "Great American Smokeout," a nationwide effort to raise awareness of nicotine addiction and the deadly risks associated with tobacco use. Working together on this day and every day throughout the year, we can create a brighter, healthier future for young Americans.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 16, 1995, as National Greeit American Smokeout Day. I call upon all Americans to join together in an effort to educate our children about the dangers of tobacco use, and I urge smokers and non-smokers alike to take this opportunity to begin healthier lifestyles that set a positive example for young people.

Thanksgiving Day, 1995

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
In 1621, Massachusetts Bay Governor William Bradford invited members of the neighboring Wampanoag tribe to join the Pilgrims as they celebrated their first harvest in a new land. This 3-day festival brought people together to delight in the richness of the earth and to give praise for their new friendships and progress. More than 300 years later, the tradition inspired by that gathering continues on Thanksgiving Day across America--a holiday that unites citizens from every culture, race, and background in common thanks for the gifts we receive from God.
As we pause to reflect on the events of the past year, we recognize anew our Nation's many and wonderful blessings. We are deeply grateful for the abundance that keeps America strong and prosperous; for our freedoms and the freedom spreading to people all over the world; for the new hope of peace in regions where people have suffered much but are working hard toward reconciliation; for the 50 years of international cooperation that have followed the end of World War II; and especially for the generosity and love that united our Nation after the tragedy in Oklahoma City. Let us open our hearts to the grace that makes all good things possible and acknowledge God's care for our world.
Let us each take time to offer thanks for the bounty of our own lives and for the relatives and friends that gather with us to share food and companionship on this special day. We give praise for the relationships that sustain us--in our families, churches, schools, and communities. We voice our appreciation for the satisfaction of work and the joys of leisure, and, most of all, we give thanks for the children that enrich our lives and remind us daily that we are the stewards of the earth and all its possibilities.
This cherished season also calls us to look forward to the challenges that lie before us as individuals and as a country. With God's help, we can shoulder our responsibilities so that future generations will inherit the wealth of opportunities we now enjoy. In everything we do, we must plan for the Thanksgivings to come and continue our efforts to build an America where everyone has a place at the table and a fair share in our Nation's harvest.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Thursday, November 23, 1995, as a National Day of Thanksgiving. I encourage all the people of the United States to assemble in their homes, places of worship, or community centers to share the spirit of goodwill and prayer; to express heartfelt gratitude for the blessings of life; and to reach out in friendship to our brothers and sisters in the larger family of mankind.

National Farm-City Week, 1995

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
When America was a new country, farms were many and small. Fanners and their families used most of what they produced, and the rest was usually sold locally. Even in 1862, when Abraham Lincoln created the Department of Agriculture, 60 percent of our labor force gained their livelihood on the farm.
Today, while less than 2 percent of American workers are actually employed on farms, thanks to new approaches and advanced technologies, our farmers feed not only the people of the United States, but also much of the world. Agriculture remains our Nation's number one industry, generating $1 trillion in economic activity every year--over 15 percent of our gross domestic product--and it is our largest employer, providing 21 million jobs.
This prosperity is due in large part to farm-city partnerships. From the sowing of crops to the purchasing of food and fiber in urban supermarkets, a network of farmers, agribusiness industries, carriers and shippers, scientists, retail distributors, and consumers has cooperated to ensure that our food supply is safe, affordable, and nutritious. As we gather with family and friends during this special week, let us give thanks for the blessings of our lives, for America's agricultural richness, and for the collaboration among rural and urban communities that makes so much of this bounty possible,
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J.

National Farm-City Week, 1995

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
When America was a new country, farms were many and small. Fanners and their families used most of what they produced, and the rest was usually sold locally. Even in 1862, when Abraham Lincoln created the Department of Agriculture, 60 percent of our labor force gained their livelihood on the farm.
Today, while less than 2 percent of American workers are actually employed on farms, thanks to new approaches and advanced technologies, our farmers feed not only the people of the United States, but also much of the world. Agriculture remains our Nation's number one industry, generating $1 trillion in economic activity every year--over 15 percent of our gross domestic product--and it is our largest employer, providing 21 million jobs.
This prosperity is due in large part to farm-city partnerships. From the sowing of crops to the purchasing of food and fiber in urban supermarkets, a network of farmers, agribusiness industries, carriers and shippers, scientists, retail distributors, and consumers has cooperated to ensure that our food supply is safe, affordable, and nutritious. As we gather with family and friends during this special week, let us give thanks for the blessings of our lives, for America's agricultural richness, and for the collaboration among rural and urban communities that makes so much of this bounty possible,
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in my by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 17 through November 23, 1995, as National Farm-City Week. I call upon citizens in urban, suburban, and rural areas throughout the Nation to acknowledge the achievements of those who work together to promote America's agricultural abundance.

acceptance, love, and reassurance that enable each of us to flourish and succeed. It creates the earliest and strongest bonds between individuals--bonds that we seek to build upon to improve our Nation as a whole.
Families are where we first learn important lessons about responsibility and where we absorb the ideals and traditions that define our unique American character. Yet we must do more to address the variety of troubles, such as substance abuse, domestic violence, and teenage pregnancy that have placed strains on the American family and threaten the well-being of our young people. At the same time, our efforts to combat crime and poverty cannot fully succeed until we rebuild our families and renew our commitment to their progress. A strong network of community. State, and national partnerships can also help families to face the challenges of everyday life.
This week, as young and old gather around the Thanksgiving table, it is crucial that we embrace and empower American families, offering them the opportunities they need to thrive and grow. Let us each take time to appreciate the value of our family relationships and rededicate ourselves to building essential ties of kinship among all people.

For many young Americans, learning to drive is a significant step along the road to maturity and independence. There are serious responsibilities that accompany getting a driver's license, and it is essential to teach our youth--and all Americans--^the terrible risks of drunk and drugged driving. Males aged 21-34 are among those most likely to drive under the influence of alcohol or drugs, and there is a critical need for additional prevention efforts aimed at this group.

Alcohol use played a role in 16,600 motor vehicle-related fatalities last year--nearly 41 percent of all such deaths. While the number of these tragedies has declined significantly over the past decade, the statistics are still devastating. We must continue our campaign of public education, provide increased law enforcement, and seek tougher laws and penalties for offenders.
Last June, I called on the Congress to make "Zero Tolerance" the law of the land and require States to adopt a Zero Tolerance standard for drivers under the age of 21. I am pleased that this provision was included in the "National Highway System Designation Act of 1995," which I signed this week. It is already against the law for young people to consume alcohol, and Zero Tolerance creates a national standard that will make it effectively illegal for young people who have been drinking to drive an automobile.
Many States have already enacted Zero Tolerance laws. These laws work--alcohol-related crashes involving teenage drivers are down as much as 20 percent in those States. When all States have these laws, hundreds more lives will be saved and thousands of injuries will be prevented. I commend the Congress for heeding my call and making Zero Tolerance the standard nationwide for drivers under the age of 21.
I am also proud that citizens across the Nation are working to spread the word about the dangers of impaired driving. Vital partnerships have formed among Federal, State, and local government agencies, private businesses, and community groups. Last year, on December 15, many Americans observed "Lights on for Life Day" by driving with their headlights illuminated in remembrance of the victims of drunk and drugged driving. I hope that caring citizens will commemorate the same day this month, doing their part to help ensure a safe holiday season.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON. President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 1995, as National Drunk and Drugged Driving Prevention Month. I urge all Americans to recognize the dangers of impaired driving; to take responsibility for themselves, their guests, and their passengers; to stop anyone under the influence of drugs or alcohol from getting behind the wheel; and to help teach children safe driving behavior.

Proclamation 6854 of November 30,1995

World AIDS Day, 1995

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Today the world pauses to remember the millions of men, women, and children who are living with HIV and AIDS and to honor the memory of those who have lost their lives to this insidious disease. We renew our commitment to searching for a cure to AIDS and a vaccine for HIV, rededicate ourselves to reducing the number of people who become infected with the virus, and devote our efforts to protecting the dignity and rights of all those affected by the AIDS epidemic.
The statistics are overwhelming. Around the world, more than 18 million people are believed to be infected with HIV. In America alone, over half a million people have been struck by AIDS, and more than 300,000 have already lost their lives. Nearly 80,000 of our fellow citizens are diagnosed with AIDS and more than 40,000 are dying of the disease each year--some 120 every day. In addition, there are an estimated 40,000 to 60,000 Americans who contract HIV annually. The impact of these numbers goes far beyond the individuals involved--each AIDS death devastates a family, weakens a community, and changes society as a whole. HIV and AIDS present extraordinary challenges to every nation and every person on our planet.
In the past year, there has been some encouraging progress. Researchers from many countries have combined their knowledge and skills to better understand the virus that causes AIDS and its effects on the human body; new AIDS drugs are being developed and approved faster than ever before; we are beginning to find ways to rebuild immune systems destroyed by HIV so that those infected can live longer, healthier lives; and we are aggressively confronting this crisis with prevention programs at the grassroots and national levels.
But there is still much work to do. Half of all new infections occur among people under the age of 25, and one-fourth occur among teenagers. We must protect the next generation by continuing to improve the availability of health care services for those with HIV and AIDS. Since 1990, the Ryan White CARE Act has offered help and hope to hundreds of thousands of people, and we are working with the Congress to extend this vital program for an additional 5 years. However, while the CARE Act is an essential element of the safety net that protects people with HIV and AIDS, it cannot do the job alone. We must also maintain our 30-year commitment to the Medicaid program, which provides services to nearly half of all Americans living with AIDS and more than 90 percent of children with AIDS. Without the protection that Medicaid affords, these individuals and their families would lose all access to health care.
Let us also continue to ensure that our Nation responds aggressively and humanely to the needs of people living with HIV and AIDS. Throughout this epidemic, community organizations have taken the lead in the struggle against the disease and in efforts to provide compassionate care to those in need. Across this country and around the globe, generous people perform miracles every day--holding a hand, cooling a fever, listening, and understanding. Let us further support

109 STAT. 1862

PROCLAMATION 6855--DEC. 5, 1995

their efforts to build a better world by strengthening the partnership between communities and government in the work to stop AIDS.
The theme of this eighth observance of World AIDS Day, "Shared Rights, Shared Responsibilities," is a call to fight against discrimination as strongly as we fight for a cure. When one human being is persecuted because of his or her HIV status, we all suffer. Let us pledge to stand together, united against HIV and AIDS and committed to ending ignorance and prejudice.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON. President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 1, 1995, as World AIDS Day. I ask the American people to join me in reaffirming our commitment to combatting HIV and AIDS and in reaching out to all those whose lives have been affected by this disease.

Human Rights Day, Bill of Rights Day, and Human Rights Week, 1995
By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation
More than 200 years ago, America's founders adopted the Bill of Rights to ensure the protection of our individual liberties. Enshrined in our Constitution are the fundamental guarantees to freedom of conscience, religion, expression, and association, as well as the rights to due process and a fair trial. Our Nation was formed on the principle that the protection and promotion of these rights are essential to a free and democratic society.
Peoples throughout the world look to the United States for leadership on human rights. In the aftermath of the Holocaust and the devastation of two world wars, our country led the international effort toward adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. For the nearly 50 years since December 10, 1948, this document has served as the standard for internationally accepted behavior by nations toward their citizens.
This year, our work to promote peace in areas of conflict and to support human rights, democracy, and the rule of law have continued to make a difference around the globe. Most recently, our efforts to foster a settlement to the terrible conflict in Bosnia resulted in an agreement that contains clear protections for human rights and humanitarian principles.
In Bosnia, and throughout the world, we have paid special attention to the most vulnerable victims of abuse--women and children. At the

Proclamation 6856 of December 6,1995
National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, 1995
By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation
America's involvement in World War II began 54 years ago as dawn was shattered by a surprise attack on our forces stationed at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. In the words of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, "December 7, 1941--a date which will live in infamy" began at 7:55 a.m. when Japan launched an offensive to destroy the United States Pacific Fleet. The losses suffered that day shocked our Nation with the realization that American soil was not immune to the ravages of war--at the end of the attack, more than 3,000 Americans were dead, missing, or wounded. We resolved to boldly defend our shores against further devastation. Just 4 years later, the same fleet that the Japanese had attempted to destroy at Pearl Harbor sailed triumphantly into Tokyo Bay.
The attack of Pearl Harbor marked the beginning of America's total mobilization against a common enemy, and the United States soon became the world's "Arsenal of Democracy." Citizens worked together toward a common goal as the "We Can Do It" attitude spread across the country. The landscape of American business was forever changed as over 19 million women and many minority workers took high-skill jobs to contribute to the war effort.

The courageous veterans who fought selflessly to bring an end to the war in the Pacific deserve our highest respect and our most profound gratitude. Today we honor the sacrifices that led to the uhimate victory--the triumph of freedom over tyranny. We also pay tribute to the families who contributed so much with their support, sacrifices, and prayers from the home front. A grateful Nation will long remember those who came home and those who did not.
In the post-Cold War era, it is vital that we pass along the lessons learned from Pearl Harbor to a new generation of Americans. We must never allow our country to be unprepared, and we must never again isolate ourselves from the problems of the world. This is the legacy we leave to our young people, and it is our responsibility to continue to teach them those lessons. By doing so, we reaffirm the values of democracy, freedom, and leadership that have made America great.

ness and accuracy of the methodology and calculations that determine the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and those recommendations should be submitted to the Bureau of Labor Statistics at the earliest possible date.
SEC. 310. HOUSE STATEMENT ON AGMCULTURE SAVINGS.
The House of Representatives shall re-examine budget reductions for agricultural programs in the United States Department of Agriculture for fiscal years 1999 and 2000 unless the following conditions are met:
(1) Land values on agricultural land on January 1, 1998, are at least 95 percent of the same values on the date of adoption of this resolution.
(2) There is enacted into law regulatory relief for the agricultural sector in the areas of wetlands regulation, the Endangered Species Act, private property rights and cost-benefit analyses of proposed regulations.
(3) There is tax relief for producers in the form of capital gains tax reduction, increased estate tax exemptions and mechanisms to average tax loads over strong and weak income years.
(4) There is no government interference in the international market in the form of agricultural trade embargoes in effect and there is successful implementation and enforcement of trade agreements, including the Greneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to lower export subsidies and reduce import barriers to trade imposed by foreign governments.
SEC. 311. SENSE OF THE HOUSE ON BASELINES.
(a) FINDINGS.--^Tlie House of Representatives finds that-- (1) baselines are projections of future spending if existing
policies remain unchanged; (2) under baseline assumptions, spending automatically
rises with inflation even if such increases are not provided under current law;
(3) baseline budgeting is inherently biased against policies that would reduce the projected growth in spending because such policies are scored as a reduction from a rising baseline; and
(4) the baseline concept has encouraged Congress to abdicate its constitutional responsibility to control the public purse for programs which are automatically fimded under existing law.
(b) SENSE OF THE HOUSE.--It is the sense of the House
of Representatives that baseline budgeting should be replaced with a form of budgeting that requires full justification and analysis of budget proposals and maximizes congressional accountability for public spending.
SEC. 312. SENSE OF THE HOUSE REGARDING A COMMISSION ON THE SOLVENCY OF THE FEDERAL MIUTARY AND CIVIL SERVICE RETIREMENT FUNDS.
(a) FINDINGS.--^The House of Representatives finds that the Federal retirement system, for both military and civil service retirees, currently has liabilities of $1,100,000,000,000, while holding assets worth $340,000,000,000 and anticipating employee contribu-

109 STAT. 1030 CONCURRENT RESOLUTIONS-^JUNE 30, 1995
tions of $220,000,000,000, which leaves an unfunded liabihty of $540,000,000,000.
(b) SENSE OF HOUSE.--It is the sense of the House of Representatives that a high-level commission should be convened to study the problems associated with the Federal retirement system and make recommendations that will ensure the long-term solvency of the military and civil service retirement funds.
SEC. 313. SENSE OF THE HOUSE REGARDING THE REPEAL OF HOUSE RULEXLIX.
It is the sense of the House that rule XLIX of the Rules of the House of Representatives (popularly known as the Gephardt rule) should be repealed.
SEC. 314. SENSE OF THE HOUSE ON EMERGENCIES.
(a) FINDINGS.--The House of Representative finds that-- (1) The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 exempted from
the discretionary spending limits and the Pay-As-You-Gro requirements for entitlement and tax legislation funding requirements that are designated by Congress and the President as an emergency.
(2) Congress and the President have increasingly misused the emergency designation by--
(A) designating funding as an emergency that is neither unforeseen nor a genuine emergency; and
(B) circumventing spending limits or passing controversial items that would not pass scrutiny in a free-standing bill,
(b) SENSE OF THE HOUSE.--It is the sense of the House
that Congress should study alternative approaches to budgeting for emergencies, including codifying the definition of an emergency and establishing contingency funds to pay for emergencies.

"(iii) employment, retirement, annuity, and unemplo3nnent systems or other provisions related to dealings between employees and employers. "(B) The Board has jurisdiction under sections 11102 and 11103 of this title over transportation provided by a local governmental authority only if the Board finds that such governmental authority meets all of the standards and requirements for being a rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission that were in effect immediately before the effective date of the ICC Termination Act of 1995. The enactment of the ICC Termination Act of 1995 shall neither expand nor contract coverage of employees and employers by the Railway Labor Act, the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974, the Railroad Retirement Tax Act, and the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act.
'^§ 10502. Authority to exempt rail carrier transportation
"(a) In a matter related to a rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Board under this part, the Board, to the maximum extent consistent with this part, shall exempt a person, class of persons, or a transaction or service whenever the Board finds that the application in whole or in part of a provision of this part--
"(1) is not necessary to carry out the transportation policy of section 10101 of this title; and
"(2) either-- "(A) the transaction or service is of limited scope; or "(B) the application in whole or in part of the provision
is not needed to protect shippers from the abuse of market power, "(b) The Board may, where appropriate, begin a proceeding under this section on its own initiative or on application by the Secretary of Transportation or an interested party.

The Board shall, within 90 days after receipt of a request for revocation under this subsection, determine whether to begin an appropriate proceeding. If the Board decides not to begin a proceeding to revoke a class exemption, the reasons for the decision shall be published in the Federal Register. Any proceeding begun as a result of a request under this subsection shall be completed within 9 months after it is begun.
"(e) No exemption order issued pursuant to this section shall operate to relieve any rail carrier from an obligation to provide contractual terms for liability and claims which are consistent with the provisions of section 11706 of this title. Nothing in this subsection or section 11706 of this title shall prevent rail carriers from offering alternative terms nor give the Board the authority

PUBLIC LAW 104-88--DEC. 29, 1995

109 STAT. 809

"(f) The Board may exercise its authority under this section to exempt transportation that is provided by a rail carrier as part of a continuous intermodal movement.
"(g) The Board may not exercise its authority under this section to relieve a rail carrier of its obligation to protect the interests of employees as required by this part.

**§ 10701. Standards for rates, classiHcations, through routes, rules, and practices
"(a) A through route established by a rail carrier must be reasonable. Divisions of joint rates by rail carriers must be made without unreasonable discrimination against a participating carrier and must be reasonable.
"(b) A rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Board under this part may not discriminate in its rates against a connecting line of another rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Board under this part or unreasonably discriminate against that line in the distribution of traffic that is not routed specifically by the shipper.
"(c) Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section and unless a rate is prohibited by a provision of this part, a rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Board under this part may establish any rate for transportation or other service provided by the rail carrier.
"(d)(1) If the Board determines, under section 10707 of this title, that a rail carrier has market dominance over the transportation to which a particular rate applies, the rate established by such carrier for such transportation must be reasonable.

109 STAT. 810

PUBLIC LAW 104^88--DEC. 29, 1995

"(2) In determining whether a rate established by a rail carrier is reasonable for purposes of this section, the Board shall give due consideration to--
"(A) the amount of traffic which is transported at revenues which do not contribute to going concern value and the efforts made to minimize such traffic;
"(B) the amount of traffic which contributes only marginally to fixed costs and the extent to which, if any, rates on such traffic can be changed to maximize the revenues from such traffic; and
"(C) the carrier's mix of rail traffic to determine whether one commodity is paying an unreasonable share of the carrier's overall revenues, recognizing the policy of this part that rail carriers shall earn adequate revenues, as established by the Board under section 10704(a)(2) of this title. "(3) The Board shall, within one year after the effective date of this paragraph, complete the pending Interstate Commerce Commission non-coal rate guidelines proceeding to establish a simplified and expedited method for determining the reasonableness of challenged rail rates in those cases in which a full stand-alone cost presentation is too costly, given the value of the case.
**§ 10702. Authority for rail carriers to establish rates, classifications, rules, and practices
"A rail carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Board under this part shall establish reasonable--
"(1) rates, to the extent required by section 10707, divisions of joint rates, and classifications for transportation and service it may provide under this part; and
"(2) rules and practices on matters related to that transportation or service.
**§ 10703. Authority for rail carriers to establish through routes
"Rail carriers providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Board under this part shall establish through routes (including physical connections) with each other and with water carriers providing transportation subject to chapter 137, shall establish rates and classifications applicable to those routes, and shall establish rules for their operation and provide--
"(1) reasonable facilities for operating the through route; and
"(2) reasonable compensation to persons entitled to compensation for services related to the through route.
**§ 10704. Authority and criteria: rates, classifications, rules, and practices prescribed by Board
"(a)(1) When the Board, after a full hearing, decides that a rate charged or collected by a rail carrier for transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Board under this part, or that a classification, rule, or practice of that carrier, does or will violate this part, the Board may prescribe the maximum rate, classification, rule, or practice to be followed. The Board may order the carrier to stop the violation. When a rate, classification, rule, or practice is prescribed under this subsection, the affected carrier may not

PUBLIC LAW 104-88--DEC. 29, 1995

109 STAT. 811

publish, charge, or collect a different rate and shall adopt the classification and observe the rule or practice prescribed by the Board.
"(2) The Board shall maintain and revise as necessary standards and procedures for establishing revenue levels for rail carriers providing transportation subject to its jurisdiction under this part that are adequate, under honest, economical, and efficient management, to cover total operating expenses, including depreciation and obsolescence, plus a reasonable and economic profit or return (or both) on capital employed in the business. The Board shall make an adequate and continuing effort to assist those carriers in attaining revenue levels prescribed under this paragraph. Revenue levels established under this paragraph should--
"(A) provide a flow of net income plus depreciation adequate to support prudent capital outlays, assure the repajmaent of a reasonable level of debt, permit the raising of needed equity capital, and cover the effects of inflation; and
"(B) attract and retain capital in amounts adequate to provide a sound transportation system in the United States. "(3) On the basis of the standards and procedures described in paragraph (2), the Board shall annually determine which rail carriers are earning adequate revenues. "(b) The Board may begin a proceeding under this section only on complaint. A complaint under subsection (a) of this section must be made under section 11701 of this title, but the proceeding may also be in extension of a complaint pending before the Board. "(c) In a proceeding to challenge the reasonableness of a rate, the Board shall make its determination as to the reasonableness of the challenged rate--
"(1) within 9 months after the close of the administrative record if the determination is based upon a stand-alone cost presentation; or
"(2) within 6 months after the close of the administrative record if the determination is based upon the methodology adopted by the Board pursuant to section 10701(d)(3). "(d) Within 9 months after the effective date of the ICC Termination Act of 1995, the Board shall establish procedures to ensure expeditious handling of challenges to the reasonableness of railroad rates. The procedures shall include appropriate measures for avoiding delay in the discovery and evidentiary phases of such proceedings and exemption or revocation proceedings, including appropriate sanctions for such delay, and for ensuring prompt disposition of motions and interlocutory administrative appeals.
**§ 10705. Authority: through routes, joint classifications, rates, and divisions prescribed by Board
"(a)(1) The Board may, and shall when it considers it desirable in the public interest, prescribe through routes, joint classifications, joint rates, the division of joint rates, and the conditions under which those routes must be operated, for a rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Board under this part.
"(2) The Board may require a rail carrier to include in a through route substantially less than the entire length of its railroad and any intermediate railroad operated with it under common management or control if that intermediate railroad lies between the terminals of the through route only when--

109 STAT. 812

PUBLIC LAW 104-88--DEC. 29, 1995

"(A) required under section 10741, 10742, or 11102 of this title;
"(B) inclusion of those lines would make the through route unreasonably long when compared with a practicable alternative through route that could be established; or
"(C) the Board decides that the proposed through route is needed to provide adequate, and more efficient or economic, transportation. The Board shall give reasonable preference, subject to this subsection, to the rail carrier originating the traffic when prescribing through routes.
"(b) The Bo£ird shall prescribe the division of joint rates to be received by a rail carrier providing transportation subject to its jurisdiction under this part when it decides that a division of joint rates established by the participating carriers under section 10703 of this title, or under a decision of the Board under subsection (a) of this section, does or will violate section 10701 of this title.
"(c) If a division of a joint rate prescribed under a decision of the Board is later found to violate section 10701 of this title, the Board may decide what division would have been reasonable and order adjustment to be made retroactive to the date the complaint was filed, the date the order for an investigation was made, or a later date that the Board decides is justified. The Board may make a decision under this subsection effective as part of its original decision.

"(a)(1) In this subsection-- "(A) the term 'affiUate' means a person controlling, con-
trolled by, or under common control or ownership with another person and 'ownership' refers to equity holdings in a business entity of at least 5 percent;
"(B) the term 'single-line rate* refers to a rate or allowance proposed by a single rail carrier that is applicable only over its line and for which the transportation (exclusive of terminal services by switching, drayage or other terminal carriers or agencies) can be provided by that carrier; and
"(C) the term 'practicably participates in the movement' shall have such meaning as the Board shall by regulation prescribe. "(2)(A) A rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Board under this part that is a party to an agreement of at least 2 rail carriers that relates to rates (including charges between rail carriers and compensation paid or received for the use of facilities and equipment), classifications, divisions, or rules related to them, or procedures for joint consideration, initiation, publication, or establishment of them, shall apply to the Board for approval of that agreement under this subsection. The Board shall approve the agreement only when it finds that the making and carrjdng out of the agreement will further the transportation policy of section 10101 of this title and may require compliance with conditions necessary to make the agreement further that policy as a condition of its approval. If the Board approves the agreement, it may be made and carried out under its terms and under the conditions required by the Board, and the Sherman Act (15 U.S.C. 1, et seq.), the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12, et seq.), the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 41, et seq.), sections

However, the Board may not approve or continue approval of an agreement when the conditions required by it are not met or if it does not receive a verified statement under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.
"(B) The Board may approve an agreement under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph only when the rail carriers applying for
approval file a verified statement with the Board. Each statement
must specify for each rail carrier that is a party to the agreement--
"(i) the name of the carrier; "(ii) the mailing address and telephone number of its headquarter's office; and . "(iii) the names of each of its affiliates and the names, addresses, and affiliates of each of its officers and directors and of each person, together with an affiliate, owning or controlling any debt, equity, or security interest in it having a value ofat least $1,000,000.
"(3)(A) An organization established or continued under an agreement approved under this subsection shall make a final disposition of a rule or rate docketed with it by the 120th day after the proposal is docketed. Such an organization may not--
"(i) permit a rail carrier to discuss, to participate in agreements related to, or to vote on single-line rates proposed by another rail carrier, except that for purposes of general rate increases and broad changes in rates, classifications, rules, and practices only, if the Board finds at any time that the implementation of this clause is not feasible, it may delay or suspend such implementation in whole or in part;
"(ii) permit a rail carrier to discuss, to participate in agreements related to, or to vote on rates related to a particular interline movement unless that rail carrier practicably participates in the movement; or
"(iii) if there are interline movements over two or more routes between the same end points, permit a carrier to discuss, to participate in agreements related to, or to vote on rates except with a carrier which forms part of a particular single route. If the Board finds at any time that the implementation of this clause is not feasible, it may delay or suspend such implementation in whole or in part.
"(B)(i) In any proceeding in which a party alleges that a rail carrier voted or agreed on a rate or allowance in violation of this subsection, that party has the burden of showing that the vote or agreement occurred. A showing of parallel behavior does not satisfy that burden by itself.
"(ii) In any proceeding in which it is alleged that a carrier was a party to an agreement, conspiracy, or combination in violation of a Federal law cited in subsection (a)(2)(A) of this section or of any similar State law, proof of an agreement, conspiracy, or combination may not be inferred from evidence that two or more rail carriers acted together with respect to an interline rate or related matter and that a party to such action took similar action with respect to a rate or related matter on another route or traffic. In any proceeding in which such a violation is alleged, evidence of a discussion or agreement between or among such rail carrier and one or more other rail carriers, or of any rate or other action

"(I) was in accordance with an agreement approved under paragraph (2) of this subsection; or
"(II) concerned an interline movement of the rail carrier,
and the discussion or agreement would not, considered by itself,
violate the laws referred to in the first sentence of this clause. In any proceeding before a jury, the court shall determine whether the requirements of subclause (I) or (II) are satisfied before allowing the introduction of any such evidence.
"(C) An organization described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall provide that transcripts or sound recordings be made of all meetings, that records of votes be made, and that such transcripts or recordings and voting records be submitted to the Board and made available to other Federal agencies in connection with their statutory responsibilities over rate bureaus, except that such material shall be kept confidential and shall not be subject to disclosure under section 552 of title 5, United States Code.
"(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, one or more rail carriers may enter into an agreement, without obtaining prior Board approval, that provides solely for compilation, publication, and other distribution of rates in effect or to become effective. The Sherman Act (15 U.S.C. 1 et seq.), the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12 et seq.), the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.), sections 73 and 74 of the Wilson Tariff Act (15 U.S.C. 8 and 9), and the Act of June 19, 1936 (15 U.S.C. 13, 13a, 13b, 21a) shall not apply to parties and other persons with respect to making or carrying out such agreement. However, the Board may, upon application or on its own initiative, investigate whether the parties to such an agreement have exceeded its scope, and upon a finding that they have, the Board may issue such orders as are necessary, including an order dissolving the agreement, to ensure that actions taken pursuant to the agreement are limited as provided in this paragraph.
"(5)(A) Whenever two or more shippers enter into an agreement to discuss among themselves that relates to the amount of compensation such shippers propose to be paid by rail carriers providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Board under this part, for use by such rail carriers of rolling stock owned or leased by such shippers, the shippers shall apply to the Board for approval of that agreement under this paragraph. The Board shall approve the agreement only when it finds that the making and carrying out of the agreement will further the transportation policy set forth in section 10101 of this title and may require compliance with conditions necessary to make the agreement further that policy as a condition of approval.

or leased by such shippers, under payment by such carriers or under a pubUshed allowance, are unable to agree upon the amount of compensation to be paid for the use of such rolling stock, any party directly involved in the negotiations may require that the matter be settled by submitting the issues in dispute to the Board. The Board shall render a binding decision, based upon a standard of reasonableness and after taking into consideration any past precedents on the subject matter of the negotiations, no later than 90 days after the date of the submission of the dispute to the Board.

'*§ 10707. Determination of market dominance in rail rate proceedings
"(a) In this section, "market dominance' means an absence of effective competition from other rail carriers or modes of transportation for the transportation to which a rate applies.

"(b) When a rate for transportation by a rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Board under this part is challenged as being unreasonably high, the Board shall determine whether the rail carrier proposing the rate has market dominance over the transportation to which the rate applies. The Board may make that determination on its own initiative or on complaint. A finding by the Board that the rail carrier does not have market dominance is determinative in a proceeding under this part related to that rate or transportation unless changed or set aside by the Board or set aside by a court of competent jurisdiction.
"(c) When the Board finds in any proceeding that a rail carrier proposing or defending a rate for transportation has market dominance over the transportation to which the rate applies, it may then determine that rate to be unreasonable if it exceeds a reasonable maximum for that transportation. However, a finding of market dominance does not establish a presumption that the proposed rate exceeds a reasonable maximum.
"(d)(1)(A) In making a determination under this section, the Board shall find that the rail carrier establishing the challenged rate does not have market dominance over the transportation to which the rate applies if such rail carrier proves that the rate charged results in a revenue-variable cost percentage for such transportation that is less than 180 percent.
"(B) For purposes of this section, variable costs for a rail carrier shall be determined only by using such carrier's unadjusted costs, calculated using the Uniform Rail Costing System cost finding methodology (or an alternative methodology adopted by the Board in lieu thereof) and indexed quarterly to account for current wage and price levels in the region in which the carrier operates, with adjustments specified by the Board. A rail carrier may meet its burden of proof under this subsection by establishing its variable costs in accordance with this paragraph, but a shipper may rebut that showing by evidence of such type, and in accordance with such burden of proof, as the Board shall prescribe.
"(2) A finding by the Board that a rate charged by a rail carrier results in a revenue-variable cost percentage for the transportation to which the rate applies that is equal to or greater than 180 percent does not establish a presumption that--
"(A) such rail carrier has or does not have market dominance over such transportation; or
"(B) the proposed rate exceeds or does not exceed a reasonable maximum.
**§ 10708. Rail cost adjustment factor
"(a) The Board shall, as often as practicable, but in no event less often than quarterly, publish a rail cost adjustment factor which shall be a fraction, the numerator of which is the latest published Index of Railroad Costs (which index shall be compiled or verified by the Board, with appropriate adjustments to reflect the change in composition of railroad costs, including the quality and mix of material and labor) and the denominator of which is the same index for the fourth quarter of every fifth year, beginning with the fourth quarter of 1992.
"(b) The rail cost adjustment factor published by the Board under subsection (a) of this section shall take into account changes in railroad productivity. The Board shall also publish a similar

PUBLIC LAW 104-88--DEC. 29, 1995

109 STAT. 817

index that does not take into account changes in railroad productivity.

«§ 10709. Contracts
"(a) One or more rail carriers providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Board under this part may enter into a contract with one or more purchasers of rail services to provide specified services under specified rates and conditions.
"(b) A party to a contract entered into under this section shall have no duty in connection with services provided under such contract other than those duties specified by the terms of the contract.
"(c)(1) A contract that is authorized by this section, and transportation under such contract, shall not be subject to this part, and may not be subsequently challenged before the Board or in any court on the grounds that such contract violates a provision of this part.
"(2) The exclusive remedy for any alleged breach of a contract entered into under this section shall be an action in an appropriate State court or United States district court, unless the parties otherwise agree. This section does not confer original jurisdiction on the district courts of the United States based on section 1331 or 1337 of title 28, United States Code.
"(d)(1) A summary of each contract for the transportation of agricultural products (including grain, as defined in section 3 of the United States Grain Standards Act (7 U.S.C. 75) and products thereof) entered into under this section shall be filed with the Board, containing such nonconfidential information as the Board prescribes. The Board shall publish special rules for such contracts in order to ensure that the essential terms of the contract are available to the general public.
"(2) Documents, papers, and records (and any copies thereof) relating to a contract described in subsection (a) shall not be subject to the mandatory disclosure requirements of section 552 of title 5.
"(e) Any lawful contract between a rail carrier and one or more purchasers of rail service that was in effect on the effective date of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 shall be considered a contract authorized by this section,
"(f) A rail carrier that enters into a contract as authorized by this section remains subject to the common carrier obligation set forth in section 11101, with respect to rail transportation not provided under such a contract.
"(g)(1) No later than 30 days after the date of filing of a summary of a contract under this section, the Board may, on complaint, begin a proceeding to review such contract on the grounds described in this subsection.
"(2)(A) A complaint may be filed under this subsection-- "(i) by a shipper on the grounds that such shipper individ-
ually will be harmed because the proposed contract unduly impairs the ability of the contracting rail carrier or carriers to meet their common carrier obligations to the complainant under section 11101 of this title; or
"(ii) by a port only on the grounds that such port individually will be harmed because the proposed contract will result in unreasonable discrimination against such port.

"(B) In addition to the grounds for a complaint described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, a complaint may be filed by a shipper of agricultural commodities on the grounds that such shipper individually will be harmed because--
"(i) the rail carrier has unreasonably discriminated by refusing to enter into a contract with such shipper for rates and services for the transportation of the same type of commodity under similar conditions to the contract at issue, and that shipper was ready, willing, and able to enter into such a contract at a time essentially contemporaneous with the period during which the contract at issue was offered; or
"(ii) the proposed contract constitutes a destructive competitive practice under this part. In making a determination under clause (ii) of this subparagraph, the Board shall consider the difference between contract rates and published single car rates.
"(C) For purposes of this paragraph, the term 'unreasonable discrimination' has the same meaning as such term has under section 10741 of this title.
"(3)(A) Within 30 days after the date a proceeding is commenced under paragraph (1) of this subsection, or within such shorter time period after such date as the Board may establish, the Board shall determine whether the contract that is the subject of such proceeding is in violation of this section.
"(B) If the Board determines, on the basis of a complaint filed under paragraph (2)(B)(i) of this subsection, that the grounds for a complaint described in such paragraph have been established with respect to a rail carrier, the Board shall, subject to the provisions of this section, order such rail carrier to provide rates and service substantially similar to the contract at issue with such differentials in terms and conditions as are justified by the evidence.
"(h)(1) Any rail carrier may, in accordance with the terms of this section, enter into contracts for the transportation of agricultural commodities (including forest products, but not including wood pulp, wood chips, pulpwood or paper) involving the utilization of carrier owned or leased equipment not in excess of 40 percent of the capacity of such carrier's owned or leased equipment by major car type (plain boxcars, covered hopper cars, gondolas and open top hoppers, coal cars, bulkhead flatcars, pulpwood rackcars, and flatbed equipment, including TOFC/COFC).
"(2) The Board may, on request of a rail carrier or other party or on its own initiative, grant such relief from the limitations of paragraph (1) of this subsection as the Board considers appropriate, if it appears that additional equipment may be made available without impairing the rail carrier's ability to meet its common carrier obligations under section 11101 of this title.
"(3)(A) This subsection shall cease to be effective after September 30, 1998.
"(B) Before October 1, 1997, the National Grain Car Council and the Railroad-Shipper Transportation Advisory Council shall make recommendations to Congress on whether to extend the effectiveness of or otherwise modify this subsection.

"SUBCHAPTER II--SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES
"§ 10721. Government traffic
"A rail carrier providing transportation or service for the United States Government may transport property or individuals for the United States Government without charge or at a rate reduced from the applicable commercial rate. Section 3709 of the Revised Statutes (41 U.S.C. 5) does not apply when transportation for the United States Government can be obtained from a rail carrier lawfully operating in the area where the transportation would be provided.
**§ 10722. Car utilization
"In order to encourage more efficient use of freight cars, notwithstanding any other provision of this part, rail carriers shall be permitted to establish premium charges for special services or special levels of services not otherwise applicable to the movement. The Board shall facilitate development of such charges so as to increase the utilization of equipment.
"SUBCHAPTER III--LIMITATIONS
'*§ 10741. Prohibitions against discrimination by rail carriers
"(a)(1) A rail carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Board under this part may not subject a person, place, port, or type of traffic to unreasonable discrimination.
"(2) For purposes of this section, a rail carrier engages in unreasonable discrimination when it charges or receives from a person a different compensation for a service rendered, or to be rendered, in transportation the rail carrier may perform under this part than it charges or receives from another person for performing a like and contemporaneous service in the transportation of a like kind of traffic under substantially similar circumstances.
"(b) This section shall not apply to-- "(1) contracts described in section 10709 of this title; "(2) rail rates applicable to different routes; or "(3) discrimination against the traffic of another carrier
providing transportation by any mode. "(c) Differences between rates, classifications, rules, and practices of rail carriers do not constitute a violation of this section if such differences result from different services provided by rail carriers.
''§ 10742. Facilities for interchange of traffic
"A rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Board under this part shall provide reasonable, proper, and equal facilities that are within its power to provide for the interchange of traffic between, and for the receiving, forwarding, and delivering of passengers and property to and from, its respective line and a connecting line of another rail carrier or of a water carrier providing transportation subject to chapter 137.
**§ 10743. Liability for payment of rates
"(a)(1) Liability for payment of rates for transportation for a shipment of property by a shipper or consignor to a consignee

109 STAT. 820

PUBLIC LAW 104-88--DEC. 29, 1995

other than the shipper or consignor, is determined under this subsection when the transportation is provided by a rail carrier under this part. When the shipper or consignor instructs the rail carrier transporting the property to deliver it to a consignee that is an agent only, not having beneficial title to the property, the consignee is liable for rates billed at the time of delivery for which the consignee is otherwise liable, but not for additional rates that may be found to be due after delivery if the consignee gives written notice to the delivering carrier before delivery of the property--
"(A) of the agency and absence of beneficial title; and "(B) of the name and address of the beneficial owner of
the property if it is reconsigned or diverted to a place other than the place specified in the original bill of lading. "(2) When the consignee is liable only for rates billed at the time of delivery under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the shipper or consignor, or, if the property is reconsigned or diverted, the beneficial owner, is liable for those additional rates regardless of the bill of lading or contract under which the property was transported. The beneficial owner is liable for all rates when the property is reconsigned or diverted by an agent but is refused or abandoned at its ultimate destination if the agent gave the rail carrier in the reconsignment or diversion order a notice of agency and the name and address of the beneficial owner, A consignee giving the rail carrier, and a reconsignor or diverter giving a rail carrier, erroneous information about the identity of the beneficial owner of the property is liable for the additional rates.
"(b) Liability for pajnnent of rates for transportation for a shipment of property by a shipper or consignor, named in the bill of lading as consignee, is determined under this subsection when the transportation is provided by a rail carrier under this part. When the shipper or consignor gives written notice, before delivery of the property, to the line-haul rail carrier that is to make ultimate delivery--
"(1) to deliver the property to another party identified by the shipper or consignor as the beneficial owner of the property; and
"(2) that delivery is to be made to that party on payment of all applicable transportation rates; that party is liable for the rates billed at the time of delivery and for additional rates that may be found to be due sifter delivery if that party does not pay the rates required to be paid under paragraph (2) of this subsection on delivery. However, if the party gives written notice to the delivering rail carrier before delivery that the party is not the beneficial owner of the property and gives the rail carrier the name and address of the beneficial owner, then the party is not liable for those additional rates. A shipper, consignor, or party to whom delivery is made that gives the delivering rail carrier erroneous information about the identity of the beneficial owner, is liable for the additional rates regardless of the bill of lading or contract under which the property was transported. This subsection does not apply to a prepaid shipment of property.
"(c)(1) A rail carrier may bring an action to enforce liability under subsection (a) of this section. That rail carrier must bring the action during the period provided in section 11705(a) of this title or by the end of the 6th month after final judgment against

PUBLIC LAW 104-88--DEC. 29, 1995

109 STAT. 821

it in an action against the consignee, or the beneficial owner named by the consignee or agent,, under that section.
"(2) A rail carrier may bring an action to enforce liability under subsection (b) of this section. That carrier must bring the action during the period provided in section 11705(a) of this title or by the end of the 6th month after final judgment against it in an action against the shipper, consignor, or other party under that section.
**§ 10744. Continuous carriage of freight
"A rail carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Board under this part may not enter a combination or arrangement to prevent the carriage of freight from being continuous from the place of shipment to the place of destination whether by change of time schedule, carriage in different cars, or by other means. The carriage of freight by those rail carriers is considered to be a continuous carriage from the place of shipment to the place of destination when a break of bulk, stoppage, or interruption is not made in good faith for a necessary purpose, and with the intent of avoiding or unnecessarily interrupting the continuous carriage or of evading this part.
"§ 10745. Transportation services or facilities furnished by shipper
"A rail carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Board under this part may establish a charge or allowance for transportation or service for property when the owner of the property, directly or indirectly, furnishes a service related to or an instrumentality used in the transportation or service. The Board may prescribe the maximum reasonable charge or allowance a rail carrier subject to its jurisdiction may pay for a service or instrumentality furnished under this section. The Board may begin a proceeding under this section on its own initiative or on application.
**§ 10746. Demurrage charges
"A rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Board under this part shall compute demurrage charges, and establish rules related to those charges, in a way that fulfills the national needs related to--
"(1) freight car use and distribution; and "(2) maintenance of an adequate supply of freight cars to be available for transportation of property.
"§ 10747. Designation of certain routes by shippers
"(a)(1) When a person delivers property to a rail carrier for transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Board under this part, the person may direct the rail carrier to transport the property over an established through route. When competing rail lines constitute a part of the route, the person shipping the property may designate the lines over which the property will be transported. The designation must be in writing. A rail carrier may be directed to transport property over a particular through route when--
"(A) there are at least 2 through routes over which the property could be transported;
"(B) a through rate has been established for transportation over each of those through routes; and

109 STAT. 822

PUBLIC LAW 104r-88--DEC. 29, 1995

"(C) the rail carrier is a party to those routes and rates. "(2) A rail carrier directed to route property transported under paragraph (1) of this subsection must issue a through bill of lading containing the routing instructions and transport the property according to the instructions. When the property is delivered to a connecting rail carrier, that rail carrier must also receive and transport it according to the routing instructions and deliver it to the next succeeding rail carrier or consignee according to the instructions.
"(b) The Board may prescribe exceptions to the authority of a person to direct the movement of traffic under subsection (a) of this section.

"(B) a statement indicating that each interested person is entitled to make recommendations to the Board on the future of the rail line; and
"(C)(i) a statement that the line is available for subsidy or sale in accordance with section 10904 of this title, (ii) a statement that the rail carrier will promptly provide to each interested party an estimate of the annual subsidy and minimum purchase price, calculated in accordance with section 10904 of this title, and (iii) the name and business address of the person who is authorized to discuss the subsidy or sale terms for the rail carrier. "(3) The rail carrier shall--
"(A) send by certified mail notice of the application to the chief executive officer of each State that would be directly affected by the proposed abandonment or discontinuance;
"(B) post a copy of the notice in each terminal and station on each portion of a railroad line proposed to be abandoned or over which all transportation is to be discontinued;
"(C) publish a copy of the notice for 3 consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in each county in which each such portion is located;
"(D) mail a copy of the notice, to the extent practicable, to all shippers that have made significant use (as designated by the Board) of the railroad line during the 12 months preceding the filing of the application; and
"(E) attach to the application filed with the Board an affidavit certifying the manner in which subparagraphs (A) through (D) of this paragraph have been satisfied, and certifying that subparagraphs (A) through (D) have been satisfied within the most recent 30 days prior to the date the application is filed.
"(b)(1) Except as provided in subsection (d), abandonment and discontinuance may occur as provided in section 10904.
"(2) The Board shall require as a condition of any abandonment or discontinuance under this section provisions to protect the interests of employees. The provisions shall be at least as beneficial to those interests as the provisions established under sections 11326(a) and 24706(c) of this title.
"(c)(1) In this subsection, the term 'potentially subject to abandonment' has the meaning given the term in regulations of the Board. The regulations may include standards that vary by region of the United States and by railroad or group of railroads.

"(1) an estimate of the annual subsidy and minimum purchase price required to keep the line or a portion of the line in operation;

109 STAT. 826

PUBLIC LAW 104-88--DEC. 29, 1995

"(2) its most recent reports on the physical condition of that part of the railroad line involved in the proposed abandonment or discontinuance;
"(3) traffic, revenue, and other data necessary to determine the amount of annual financial assistance which would be required to continue rail transportation over that part of the railroad line; and
"(4) any other information that the Board considers necessary to allow a potential offeror to calculate an adequate subsidy or purchase offer. "(c) Within 4 months after an application is filed under section 10903, any person may offer to subsidize or purchase the railroad line that is the subject of such application. Such offer shall be filed concurrently with the Board. If the offer to subsidize or purchase is less than the carrier's estimate stated pursuant to subsection (b)(1), the offer shall explain the basis of the disparity, and the manner in which the offer is calculated.
"(d)(1) Unless the Board, within 15 days after the expiration of the 4-month period described in subsection (c), finds that one or more financially responsible persons (including a governmental authority) have offered financial assistance regarding that part of the railroad line to be abandoned or over which all rail transportation is to be discontinued, abandonment or discontinuance may be carried out in accordance with section 10903.
"(2) If the Board finds that such an offer or offers of financial assistance has been made within such period, abandonment or discontinuance shall be postponed until--
"(A) the carrier and a financially responsible person have reached agreement on a transaction for subsidy or sale of the line; or
"(B) the conditions and amount of compensation are established under subsection (f). "(e) Except as provided in subsection (f)(3), if the rail carrier and a financially responsible person (including a governmental authority) fail to agree on the amount or terms of the subsidy or purchase, either party may, within 30 days after the offer is made, request that the Board establish the conditions and amount of compensation.
"(^(1) Whenever the Board is requested to establish the conditions and amount of compensation under this section--
"(A) the Board shall render its decision within 30 days; "(B) for proposed sales, the Board shall determine the price £md other terms of sale, except that in no case shall the Board set a price which is below the fair market value of the line (including, unless otherwise mutually agreed, all facilities on the line or portion necessary to provide effective transportation services); and
"(C) for proposed subsidies, the Board shall establish the compensation as the difference between the revenues attributable to that part of the railroad line and the avoidable cost of providing rail freight transportation on the line, plus a reasonable return on the value of the line. "(2) The decision of the Board shall be binding on both parties, except that the person who has offered to subsidize or purchase the line may withdraw his offer within 10 days of the Board's decision. In such a case, the abandonment or discontinuance may

PUBLIC LAW 104-88--DEC. 29, 1995

109 STAT. 827

be carried out immediately, unless other offers are being considered pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subsection.
"(3) If a rail carrier receives more than one offer to subsidize or purchase, it shall select the offeror with whom it wishes to transact business, and complete the subsidy or sale agreement, or request that the Board establish the conditions and amount of compensation before the 40th day after the expiration of the 4-month period described in subsection (c). If no agreement on subsidy or sale is reached within such 40-day period and the Board has not been requested to establish the conditions and amount of compensation, any other offeror whose offer was made within the 4-month period described in subsection (c) may request that the Board establish the conditions and amount of compensation. If the Board has established the conditions and amount of compensation, and the original offer has been withdrawn, any other offeror whose offer was made within the 4-month period described in subsection (c) may accept the Board's decision within 20 days after such decision, and the Board shall require the carrier to enter into a subsidy or sale agreement with such offeror, if such subsidy or sale agreement incorporates the Board's decision.
"(4)(A) No purchaser of a line or portion of line sold under this section may transfer or discontinue service on such line prior to the end of the second year after consummation of the sale, nor may such purchaser transfer such line, except to the rail carrier from whom it was purchased, prior to the end of the fifth year after consummation of the sale.
"(B) No subsidy arrangement approved under this section shall remain in effect for more than one year, unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties.
"(g) Upon abandonment of a railroad line under this chapter, the obligation of the rail carrier abandoning the line to provide transportation on that line, as required by section 11101(a), is extinguished.
*'§ 10905. Offering abandoned rail properties for sale for public purposes
"When the Board approves an application to abandon or discontinue under section 10903, the Board shall find whether the rail properties that are involved in the proposed abandonment or discontinuance are appropriate for use for public purposes, including highways, other forms of mass transportation, conservation, energy production or transmission, or recreation. If the Board finds that the rail properties proposed to be abandoned are appropriate for public purposes and not required for continued rail operations, the properties may be sold, leased, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of only under conditions provided in the order of the Board. The conditions may include a prohibition on any such disposal for a period of not more than 180 days after the effective date of the order, unless the properties have first been offered, on reasonable terms, for sale for public purposes.
"§ 10906. Exception
"Notwithstanding section 10901 and subchapter II of chapter 113 of this title, and without the approval of the Board, a rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Board under this part may enter into arrangements for the joint ownership or joint use of spur, industrial, team, switching, or side

tracks. The Board does not have authority under this chapter over construction, acquisition, operation, abandonment, or discontinuance of spur, industrial, team, switching, or side tracks.
*'§ 10907. Railroad development
"(a) In this section, the term 'financially responsible person' means a person who--
"(1) is capable of paying the constitutional minimum value of the railroad line proposed to be acquired; and
"(2) is able to assure that adequate transportation will be provided over such line for a period of not less than 3 years. Such term includes a governmental authority but does not include a Class I or Class II rail carrier. "(b)(1) When the Board finds that--
"(A)(i) the public convenience and necessity require or permit the sale of a particular railroad line under this section; or
"(ii) a railroad line is on a system diagram map as required under section 10903 of this title, but the rail carrier owning such line has not filed an application to abandon such line under section 10903 of this title before an application to purchase such line, or any required preliminary filing with respect to such application, is filed under this section; and
"(B) an application to purchase such line has been filed by a financially responsible person, the Board shall require the rail carrier owning the railroad line to sell such line to such financially responsible person at a price not less than the constitutional minimum value. "(2) For purposes of this subsection, the constitutional minimum value of a particular railroad line shall be presumed to be not less than the net liquidation value of such line or the going concern value of such line, whichever is greater. "(c)(1) For purposes of this section, the Board may determine that the public convenience and necessity require or permit the sale of a railroad line if the Board determines, after a hearing on the record, that--
"(A) the rail carrier operating such line refuses within a reasonable time to make the necessary efforts to provide adequate service to shippers who transport traffic over such line;
"(B) the transportation over such line is inadequate for the majority of shippers who transport traffic over such line;
"(C) the sale of such line will not have a significantly adverse financial effect on the rail carrier operating such line;
"(D) the sale of such line will not have an adverse effect on the overall operational performance of the rail carrier operating such line; and
"(E) the sale of such line will be likely to result in improved railroad transportation for shippers that transport traffic over such line. "(2) In a proceeding under this subsection, the burden of proving that the public convenience and necessity require or permit the sale of a particular railroad line is on the person filing the application to acquire such line. If the Board finds under this subsection that the public convenience and necessity require or permit the g^j^ ^^ ^ particular railroad line, the Board shall concurrently

PUBLIC LAW 104^88--DEC. 29, 1995

109 STAT. 829

notify the parties of such finding and pubUsh such finding in the Federal Register.
"(d) In the case of any railroad line subject to sale under subsection (a) of this section, the Board shall, upon the request of the acquiring carrier, require the selling carrier to provide to the acquiring carrier trackage rights to allow a reasonable interchange with the selling carrier or to move power equipment or empty rolling stock between noncontiguous feeder lines operated by the acquiring carrier. The Board shall require the acquiring carrier to provide the selling carrier reasonable compensation for any such trackage rights.
"(e) The Board shall require, to the maximum extent practicable, the use of the employees who would normally have performed work in connection with a railroad line subject to a sale under this section.
"(f) In the case of a railroad line which carried less than 3,000,000 gross ton miles of traffic per mile in the preceding calendar year, whenever a purchasing carrier under this section petitions the Board for joint rates applicable to traffic moving over through routes in which the purchasing carrier may practicably participate, the Board shall, within 30 days after the date such petition is filed and pursuant to section 10705(a) of this title, require the establishment of reasonable joint rates and divisions over such route.
"(g)(1) Any person operating a railroad line acquired under this section may elect to be exempt from any of the provisions of this part, except that such a person may not be exempt from the provisions of chapter 107 of this title with respect to transportation under a joint rate.
"(2) The provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection shall apply to any line of railroad which was abandoned during the 18-month period immediately prior to October 1, 1980, and was subsequently purchased by a financially responsible person.
"(h) If a purchasing carrier under this section proposes to sell or abandon all or any portion of a purchased railroad line, such purchasing carrier shall offer the right of first refusal with respect to such line or portion thereof to the carrier which sold such line under this section. Such offer shall be made at a price equal to the sum of the price paid by such purchasing carrier to such selling carrier for such line or portion thereof and the fair market value (less deterioration) of any improvements made, as adjusted to reflect inflation.
"(i) Any person operating a railroad line acquired under this section may determine preconditions, such as payment of a subsidy, which must be met by shippers in order to obtain service over such lines, but such operator must notify the shippers on the line of its intention to impose such preconditions.

"SUBCHAPTER I--GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
^'§ 11101. Common carrier transportation, service, and rates
"(a) A rail carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Board under this part shall provide the transportation or service on reasonable request. A rail carrier shall not be found to have violated this section because it fulfills its reasonable commitments under contracts authorized under section 10709 of this title before responding to reasonable requests for service. Commitments which deprive a carrier of its ability to respond to reasonable requests for common carrier service are not reasonable.
"(b) A rail carrier shall also provide to any person, on request, the carrier's rates and other service terms. The response by a rail carrier to a request for the carrier's rates and other service terms shall be--
"(1) in writing and forwarded to the requesting person promptly after receipt of the request; or
"(2) promptly made available in electronic form. "(c) A rail carrier may not increase any common carrier rates or change any common carrier service terms unless 20 days have expired after written or electronic notice is provided to any person who, within the previous 12 months--
"(1) has requested such rates or terms under subsection (b);or
"(2) has made arrangements with the carrier for a shipment that would be subject to such increased rates or changed terms. "(d) With respect to transportation of agricultural products, in addition to the requirements of subsections (a), (b), and (c), a rail carrier shall publish, make available, and retain for public inspection its common carrier rates, schedules of rates, and other service terms, and any proposed and actual changes to such rates and service terms. For purposes of this subsection, agricultural products shall include grain as defined in section 3 of the United States Grain Standards Act (7 U.S.C. 75) and all products thereof, and fertilizer. "(e) A rail carrier shall provide transportation or service in accordance with the rates and service terms, £uid any changes thereto, as published or otherwise made available under subsection (b),(c),or(d). "(f) The Board shall, by regulation, establish rules to implement this section. The regulations shall provide for immediate disclosure and dissemination of rates and service terms, including classifica-

PUBLIC LAW 104-88--DEC. 29, 1995

109 STAT. 831

tions, rules, and practices, and their effective dates. Final regulations shall be adopted by the Board not later than 180 days after the effective date of the ICC Termination Act of 1995.
""§ 11102. Use of terminal facilities
"(a) The Board may require terminal facilities, including mainline tracks for a reasonable distance outside of a terminal, owned by a rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Board under this part, to be used by another rail carrier if the Board finds that use to be practicable and in the public interest without substantially impairing the ability of the rail carrier owning the facilities or entitled to use the facilities to handle its own business. The rail carriers are responsible for establishing the conditions and compensation for use of the facilities. However, if the rail carriers cannot agree, the Board may establish conditions and compensation for use of the facilities under the principle controlling compensation in condemnation proceedings. The compensation shall be paid or adequately secured before a rail carrier may begin to use the facilities of another rail carrier under this section.
"(b) A rail carrier whose terminal facilities are required to be used by another rail carrier under this section is entitled to recover damages from the other rail carrier for injuries sustained as the result of compliance with the requirement or for compensation for the use, or both as appropriate, in a civil action, if it is not satisfied with the conditions for use of the facilities or if the amount of the compensation is not paid promptly.
"(c)(1) The Board may require rail carriers to enter into reciprocal switching agreements, where it finds such agreements to be practicable and in the public interest, or where such agreements are necessary to provide competitive rail service. The rail carriers entering into such an agreement shall establish the conditions and compensation applicable to such agreement, but, if the rail carriers cannot agree upon such conditions and compensation within a reasonable period of time, the Board may establish such conditions and compensation.
"(2) The Board may require reciprocal switching agreements entered into by rail carriers pursuant to this subsection to contain provisions for the protection of the interests of employees affected thereby.
"(d) The Board shall complete any proceeding under subsection (a) or (b) within 180 days after the filing of the request for relief.
'*§ 11103. Switch connections and tracks
"(a) On application of the owner of a lateral branch line of railroad, or of a shipper tendering interstate traffic for transportation, a rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Board under this part shall construct, maintain, and operate, on reasonable conditions, a switch connection to connect that branch line or private side track with its railroad and shall furnish cars to move that traffic to the best of its ability without discrimination in favor of or against the shipper when the connection--
"(1) is reasonably practicable; "(2) can be made safely; and "(3) will furnish sufficient business to justify its construction and maintenance.

109 STAT. 832

PUBLIC LAW 104^88--DEC. 29, 1995

Safety.

"(b) If a rail carrier fails to install and operate a switch connection after application is made under subsection (a) of this section, the owner of the lateral branch line of railroad or the shipper may file a complaint with the Board under section 11701 of this title. The Board shall investigate the complaint and decide the safety, practicability, justification, and compensation to be paid for the connection. The Board may direct the rail carrier to comply with subsection (a) of this section only after a full hearing.
"SUBCHAPTER II--CAR SERVICE
"§11121. Criteria
"(a)(1) A rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Board under this part shall furnish safe and adequate car service and establish, observe, and enforce reasonable rules and practices on car service. The Board may require a rail carrier to provide facilities and equipment that are reasonably necessary to furnish safe and adequate car service if the Board decides that the rail carrier has materially failed to furnish that service. The Board may begin a proceeding under this paragraph when an interested person files an application with it. The Board may act only after a hearing on the record and an affirmative finding, based on the evidence presented, that--
"(A) providing the facilities or equipment will not materially and adversely affect the ability of the rail carrier to provide safe and adequate transportation;
"(B) the amount spent for the facilities or equipment, including a return equal to the rail carrier's current cost of capital, will be recovered; and
"(C) providing the facilities or equipment will not impair the ability of the rail carrier to attract adequate capital. "(2) The Board may require a rail carrier to file its car service rules with the Board. "(b) The Board may designate and appoint agents and agencies to make and carry out its directions related to car service and matters under sections 11123 and 11124(a)(1) of this title. "(c) The Board shall consult, as it considers necessary, with the National Grain Car Council on matters within the charter of that body.
"§ 11122. Compensation and practice
"(a) The regulations of the Board on car service shall encourage the purchase, acquisition, and efficient use of freight cars. The regulations may include--
"(1) the compensation to be paid for the use of a locomotive, freight car, or other vehicle;
"(2) the other terms of any arrangement for the use by a rail carrier of a locomotive, freight car, or other vehicle not owned by the rail carrier using the locomotive, freight car, or other vehicle, whether or not owned by another carrier, shipper, or third person; and
"(3) sanctions for nonobservance. "(b) The rate of compensation to be paid for each type of freight car shall be determined by the expense of owning and maintaining that type of freight car, including a fair return on its cost giving consideration to current costs of capital, repairs, materials, parts, and labor. In determining the rate of compensa-

PUBLIC LAW 104-88--DEC. 29, 1995

109 STAT. 833

tion, the Board shall consider the transportation use of each type of freight car, the national level of ownership of each type of freight car, and other factors that affect the adequacy of the national freight car supply.
"§11123. Situations requiring immediate action to serve the public
"(a) When the Board determines that shortage of equipment, congestion of traffic, unauthorized cessation of operations, or other failure of traffic movement exists which creates an emergency situation of such magnitude as to have substantial adverse effects on shippers, or on rail service in a region of the United States, or that a rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Board under this part cannot transport the traffic offered to it in a manner that properly serves the public, the Board may, to promote commerce and service to the public, for a period not to exceed 30 days--
"(1) direct the handling, routing, and movement of the traffic of a rail carrier and its distribution over its own or other railroad lines;
"(2) require joint or common use of railroad facilities; "(3) prescribe temporary through routes; or "(4) give directions for--
"(A) preference or priority in transportation; "(B) embargoes; or "(C) movement of traffic under permits. "(b)(1) Except with respect to proceedings under paragraph (2) of this subsection, the Board may act under this section on its own initiative or on application without regard to subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5. "(2) Rail carriers may establish between themselves the terms of compensation for operations, and use of facilities and equipment, required under this section. When rail carriers do not agree on the terms of compensation under this section, the Board may establish the terms for them. The Board may act under subsection (a) before conducting a proceeding under this paragraph. "(3) When a rail carrier is directed under this section to operate the lines of another rail carrier due to that carrier's cessation of operations, compensation for the directed operations shall derive only from revenues generated by the directed operations. "(c)(1) The Board may extend any action taken under subsection (a) of this section beyond 30 days if the Board finds that a transportation emergency described in subsection (a) continues to exist. Action by the Board under subsection (a) of this section may not remain in effect for more than 240 days beyond the initial 30day period. "(2) The Board may not take action under this section that would-- "(A) cause a rail carrier to operate in violation of this part; or "(B) impair substantially the ability of a rail carrier to serve its own customers adequately, or to fulfill its common carrier obligations. "(3) A rail carrier directed by the Board to take action under this section is not responsible, as a result of that action, for debts of any other rail carrier.

"(d) In carrying out this section, the Board shall require, to the maximum extent practicable, the use of employees who would normally have performed work in connection with the traffic subject to the action of the Board.
'*§ 11124. War emergencies; embargoes imposed by carriers
"(a)(1) When the President, during time of war or threatened war, notifies the Board that it is essential to the defense and security of the United States to give preference or priority to the movement of certain traffic, the Board shall direct that preference or priority be given to that traffic.
"(2) When the President, during time of war or threatened war, demands that preference and precedence be given to the transportation of troops and material of war over all other traffic, all rail carriers providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Board under this part shall adopt every means within their control to facilitate and expedite the military traffic.
"(b) An embargo imposed by any such rail carrier does not apply to shipments consigned to agents of the United States Government for its use. The rail carrier shall deliver those shipments as promptly as possible.

However, if a purchase and sale, a lease, or a corporate consolidation or merger is involved in the transaction, the carrier or corporation may carry out the transaction only with the assent of a majority, or the number required under applicable State law, of the votes of the holders of the capital stock of that corporation entitled to vote. The vote must occur at a regular meeting, or special meeting called for that purpose, of those stockholders and the notice of the meeting must indicate its purpose.

The Board may approve and authorize the agreement or combination if the rail carriers involved assent to the pooling or division and the Board finds that a pooling or division of traffic, services, or earnings--
"(1) will be in the interest of better service to the public or of economy of operation; and
"(2) will not unreasonably restrain competition. "(b) The Board may impose conditions governing the pooling or division and may approve and authorize payment of a reasonable consideration between the rail carriers. "(c) The Board may begin a proceeding under this section on its own initiative or on application.
**§ 11323. Consolidation, merger, and acquisition of control
"(a) The following transactions involving rail carriers providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Board under this

"(2) A transaction by a person affiliated with a rail carrier that has the effect of putting that rail carrier and persons giffiliated with it, taken together, in control of another rail carrier.
"(3) A transaction by at least 2 persons acting together (one of whom is a rail carrier or is affiliated with a rail carrier) that has the effect of putting those persons and rail carriers and persons affiliated with any of them, or with any of those affiliated rsdl carriers, taken together, in control of another rail carrier. "(c) A person is affiliated with a rail carrier under this subchapter if, because of the relationship between that person and a rail carrier, it is reasonable to believe that the affairs of another rail carrier, control of which may be acquired by that person, will be managed in the interest of the other rail carrier.
^§ 11324. Consolidation, merger, and acquisition of control: conditions of approval
"(a) The Board may begin a proceeding to approve and authorize a transaction referred to in section 11323 of this title on application of the person seeking that authority.

"(b) In a proceeding under this section which involves the merger or control of at least two Class I railroads, as defined by the Board, the Board shall consider at least--
"(1) the effect of the proposed transaction on the adequacy of transportation to the public;
"(2) the effect on the public interest of including, or failing to include, other rail carriers in the area involved in the proposed transaction;
"(3) the total fixed charges that result from the proposed transaction;
"(4) the interest of rail carrier employees affected by the proposed transaction; and
"(5) whether the proposed transaction would have an
adverse effect on competition among rail carriers in the affiBcted region or in the national rail system. "(c) The Board shall approve and authorize a transaction under this section when it finds the transaction is consistent with the public interest. The Board may impose conditions governing the transaction, including the divestiture of parallel tracks or requiring the granting of trackage rights and access to other facilities. Any trackage rights and related conditions imposed to alleviate anticompetitive effects of the transaction shall provide for operating terms and compensation levels to ensure that such effects are alleviated. When the transaction contemplates a guaranty or assumption of payment of dividends or of fixed charges or will result in an increase of total fixed charges, the Board may approve and authorize the transaction only if it finds that the guaranty, assumption, or increase is consistent with the public interest. The Board may require inclusion of other rail carriers located in the area involved in the transaction if they apply for inclusion and the Board finds their inclusion to be consistent with the public interest.
"(d) In a proceeding under this section which does not involve the merger or control of at least two Class I railroads, as defined by the Board, the Board shall approve such an application unless it finds that--

region of the United States; and "(2) the anticompetitive effects of the transaction outweigh
the public interest in meeting significant transportation needs. In making such findings, the Board shall, with respect to any application that is part of a plan or proposal developed under section 333(a)-(d) of this title, accord substantial weight to any recommendations of the Attorney General.
"(e) No transaction described in section 11326(b) may have the effect of avoiding a collective bargaining agreement or shifting work from a rail carrier with a collective bargaining agreement to a rail carrier without a collective bargaining agreement.

tax levied by a taxing district; "(2) the term 'assessment jurisdiction' means a geographical
area in a State used in determining the assessed value of property for ad valorem taxation;
"(3) the term 'rail transportation property* means property, as defined by the Board, owned or used by a rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Board under this part; and

"(b) The following acts unreasonably burden and discriminate against interstate commerce, and a State, subdivision of a State, or authority acting for a State or subdivision of a State may not do any of them:
"(1) Assess rail transportation property at a value that has a higher ratio to the true market value of the rail transportation property than the ratio that the assessed value of other commercial and industrial property in the same assessment jurisdiction has to the true market value of the other commercial and industrial property.
"(2) Levy or collect a tax on an assessment that may not be made under paragraph (1) of this subsection.
"(3) Levy or collect an ad valorem property tax on rail transportation property at a tax rate that exceeds the tax rate applicable to commercial and industrial property in the same assessment jurisdiction.

"(1) an assessment of the rail transportation property at a value that has a higher ratio to the true market value of the rail transportation property than the assessed value of all other property subject to a property tax levy in the assessment jurisdiction has to the true market value of all other commercial and industrial property; and
"(2) the collection of an ad valorem property tax on the rail transportation property at a tax rate that exceeds the tax ratio rate applicable to taxable property in the taxing district.

109 STAT. 848

PUBLIC LAW 104-88--DEC. 29, 1995

to the jurisdiction of the Board under this part are hable to the person entitled to recover under the receipt or bill of lading. The liability imposed under this subsection is for the actual loss or injury to the property caused by--
"(1) the receiving rail carrier; "(2) the delivering rail carrier; or
"(3) another rail carrier over whose line or route the property is transported in the United States or from a place in the United States to a place in an adjacent foreign country when transported under a through bill of lading. Failure to issue a receipt or bill of lading does not affect the liability of a rail carrier. A delivering rail carrier is deemed to be the rail carrier performing the line-haul transportation nearest the destination but does not include a rail carrier providing only a switching service at the destination.
"(b) The rail carrier issuing the receipt or bill of lading under subsection (a) of this section or delivering the property for which the receipt or bill of lading was issued is entitled to recover from the rail carrier over whose line or route the loss or injury occurred the amount required to be paid to the owners of the property, as evidenced by a receipt, judgment, or transcript, and the amount of its expenses reasonably incurred in defending a civil action brought by that person.
"(c)(1) A rail carrier may not limit or be exempt from liability imposed under subsection (a) of this section except as provided in this subsection. A limitation of liability or of the amount of recovery or representation or agreement in a receipt, bill of lading, contract, or rule in violation of this section is void.
"(2) A rail carrier of passengers may limit its liability under its passenger rate for loss or injury of baggage carried on trains carrying passengers.
"(3) A rail carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Board under this part may establish rates for transportation of property under which--
"(A) the liability of the rail carrier for such property is limited to a value established by written declaration of the shipper or by a written agreement between the shipper and the carrier; or
"(B) specified amounts are deducted, pursuant to a written agreement between the shipper and the carrier, from any claim against the carrier with respect to the transportation of such property.
"(d)(1) A civil action under this section may be brought in a district court of the United States or in a State court.
"(2)(A) A civil action under this section may only be brought-- "(i) against the originating rail carrier, in the judicial dis-
trict in which the point of origin is located; "(ii) against the delivering rail carrier, in the judicial dis-
trict in which the principal place of business of the person bringing the action is located if the delivering carrier operates a railroad or a route through such judicial district, or in the judicial district in which the point of destination is located; and
"(iii) against the carrier alleged to have caused the loss or damage, in the judicial district in which such loss or damage is alleged to have occurred.

"(B) In this section, 'judicial district' means (i) in the case of a United States district court, a judicial district of the United States, and (ii) in the case of a State court, the applicable geographic area over which such court exercises jurisdiction.
"(e) A rail carrier may not provide by rule, contract, or otherwise, a period of less than 9 months for filing a claim against it under this section and a period of less than 2 years for bringing a civil action against it under this section. The period for bringing a civil action is computed from the date the carrier gives a person written notice that the carrier has disallowed any part of the claim specified in the notice. For the purposes of this subsection--
"(1) an offer of compromise shall not constitute a disallowance of any part of the claim unless the carrier, in writing, informs the claimant that such part of the claim is disallowed and provides reasons for such disallowance; and
"(2) communications received from a carrier's insurer shall not constitute a disallowance of any part of the claim unless the insurer, in writing, informs the claimant that such part of the claim is disallowed, provides reasons for such disallowance, and informs the claimant that the insurer is acting on behalf of the carrier.
§"11707. Liability when property is delivered in violation of routing instructions
"(a)(1) When a rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Board under this part diverts or delivers property to another rail carrier in violation of routing instructions in the bill of lading, both of those rail carriers are jointly and severally liable to the rail carrier that was deprived of its right to participate in hauling that property for the total amount of the rate it would have received if it participated in hauling the property.
"(2) A rail carrier is not liable under paragraph (1) of this subsection when it diverts or delivers property in compliance with an order or regulation of the Board.
"(3) A rail carrier to whom property is transported is not liable under this subsection if it shows that it had no notice of the routing instructions before transporting the property. The burden of proving lack of notice is on that rail carrier.
"(b) The court shall award a reasonable attorney's fee to the plaintiff in a judgment against the defendant rail carrier under subsection (a) of this section. The court shall tax and collect that fee as a part of the costs of the action.

''§ 14706. Liability of carriers under receipts and bills of

lading

.

"(a) GENERAL LIABILITY.--
"(1) MOTOR CARRIERS AND FREIGHT FORWARDERS.--A carrier providing transportation or service subject to jurisdiction under subchapter I or III of chapter 135 shall issue a receipt or bill of lading for property it receives for transportation under this part. That carrier and any other carrier that delivers

109 STAT. 908

PUBLIC LAW 104-88--DEC. 29, 1995

the property and is providing transportation or service subject to jurisdiction under subchapter I or III of chapter 135 or chapter 105 are Hable to the person entitled to recover under the receipt or bill of lading. The liability imposed under this paragraph is for the actual loss or injury to the property caused by (A) the receiving carrier, (B) the delivering carrier, or (C) another carrier over whose line or route the property is transported in the United States or from a place in the United States to a place in an adjacent foreign country when transported under a through bill of lading and, except in the case of a freight forwarder, applies to property reconsigned or diverted under a tariff under section 13702. Failure to issue a receipt or bill of lading does not affect the liability of a carrier. A delivering carrier is deemed to be the carrier performing the line-haul transportation nearest the destination but does not include a carrier providing only a switching service at the destination.
"(2) FREIGHT FORWARDER.--^A freight forwarder is both the receiving and delivering carrier. When a freight forwarder provides service and uses a motor carrier providing transportation subject to jurisdiction under subchapter I of chapter 135 to receive property from a consignor, the motor carrier may execute the bill of lading or shipping receipt for the freight forwarder with its consent. With the consent of the freight forwarder, a motor carrier may deliver property for a freight forwarder on the freight forwarder's bill of lading, freight bill, or shipping receipt to the consignee named in it, and receipt for the property may be made on the freight forwarder's delivery receipt. "(b) APPORTIONMENT.--^The carrier issuing the receipt or bill of lading under subsection (a) of this section or delivering the property for which the receipt or bill of lading was issued is entitled to recover from the carrier over whose line or route the loss or injury occurred the amount required to be paid to the owners of the property, as evidenced by a receipt, judgment, or transcript, and the amount of its expenses reasonably incurred in defending a civil action brought by that person.
"(c) SPECIAL RULES.--
"(1) MOTOR CARRIERS.--
"(A) SHIPPER WAIVER.--Subject to the provisions of subparagraph (B), a carrier providing transportation or service subject to jurisdiction under subchapter I or III of chapter 135 may, subject to the provisions of this chapter (including with respect to a motor carrier, the requirements of section 13710(a)), establish rates for the transportation of property (other than household goods described in section 13102(10)(A)) under which the liability of the carrier for such property is limited to a value established by written or electronic declaration of the shipper or by written agreement between the carrier and shipper if that value would be reasonable under the circumstances surrounding the transportation.
"(B) CARRIER NOTIFICATION.--If the motor carrier is not required to file its tariff with the Board, it shall provide under section 13710(a)(1) to the shipper, on request of the shipper, a written or electronic copy of the rate, classification, rules, and practices upon which any rate applicable

PUBLIC LAW 104-88--DEC. 29, 1995

109 STAT. 909

to a shipment, or agreed to between the shipper and the carrier, is based. The copy provided by the carrier shall clearly state the dates of applicability of the rate, classification, rules, or practices.
"(C) PROHIBITION AGAINST COLLECTIVE ESTABLISH-
MENT.--No discussion, consideration, or approval as to rules to limit liability under this subsection may be undertaken by carriers acting under an agreement approved pursuant to section 13703.
"(2) WATER CARRIERS.--If loss or injury to property occurs while it is in the custody of a water carrier, the liability of that carrier is determined by its bill of lading and the law applicable to water transportation. The liability of the initial or delivering carrier is the same as the liability of the water carrier.
"(d) CIVIL ACTIONS.--
"(1) AGAINST DELIVERING CARRIER.--^A civil action under this section may be brought against a delivering carrier in a district court of the United States or in a State court. Trial, if the action is brought in a district court of the United States is in a judicial district, and if in a State court, is in a State through which the defendant carrier operates.

"(3) JURISDICTION OF COURTS.--^A civil action under this section may be brought in a United States district court or in a State court.
"(4) JUDICIAL DISTRICT DEFINED.--In this section, 'judicial district' means--
"(A) in the case of a United States district court, a judicial district of the United States; and
"(B) in the case of a State court, the applicable geographic area over which such court exercises jurisdiction.
"(e) MINIMUM PERIOD FOR FILING CLAIMS.--
"(1) IN GENERAL.--A carrier may not provide by rule, contract, or otherwise, a period of less than 9 months for filing a claim against it under this section and a period of less than 2 years for bringing a civil action against it under this section. The period for bringing a civil action is computed from the date the carrier gives a person written notice that the carrier has disallowed any part of the claim specified in the notice.
"(2) SPECIAL RULES.--^For the purposes of this subsection-- "(A) an offer of compromise shall not constitute a dis-
allowance of any part of the claim unless the carrier, in writing, informs the claimant that such part of the claim is disallowed and provides reasons for such disallowance; and
"(B) communications received from a carrier's insurer shall not constitute a disallowance of any part of the claim unless the insurer, in writing, informs the claimant that such part of the claim is disallowed, provides reason for

PUBLIC LAW 104-88--DEC. 29, 1995

"(g) MODIFICATIONS AND REFORMS.--
"(1) STUDY.--^The Secretary shall conduct a study to determine whether any modifications or reforms should be made to the loss and damage provisions of this section, including those related to limitation of liability by carriers.
"(2) FACTORS TO CONSIDER.--In conducting the study, the Secretary, at a minimum, shall consider--
"(A) the efficient delivery of transportation services; "(B) international and intermodal harmony; "(C) the public interest; and "(D) the interest of carriers and shippers. "(3) REPORT.--^Not later than 12 months after the effective date of this section, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report on the results of the study, together with any recommendations of the Secretary (including legislative recommendations) for implementing modifications or reforms identified by the Secretary as being appropriate.
**§ 14707. Private enforcement of registration requirement
"(a) IN GENERAL.--If a person provides transportation by motor vehicle or service in clear violation of section 13901-13904 or 13906, a person injured by the transportation or service may bring a civil action to enforce any such section. In a civil action under this subsection, trial is in the judicial district in which the person who violated that section operates.
"(b) PROCEDURE.--^A copy of the complaint in a civil action under subsection (a) shall be served on the Secretary and a certificate of service must appear in the complaint filed with the court. The Secretary may intervene in a civil action under subsection (a). The Secretary may notify the district court in which the action is pending that the Secretary intends to consider the matter that is the subject of the complaint in a proceeding before the Secretary.

PUBLIC LAW 104-88--DEC. 29, 1995

109 STAT. 911

"(b) ARBITRATION REQUIREMENTS.--
"(1) PREVENTION OF SPECIAL ADVANTAGE.--^The arbitration that is offered must be designed to prevent a carrier from having any special advantage in any case in which the claimant resides or does business at a place distant from the carrier's principal or other place of business.
"(2) NOTICE OF ARBITRATION PROCEDURE.--The carrier must provide the shipper an adequate notice of the availability of neutral arbitration, including a concise easy-to-read, accurate summary of the arbitration procedure, any applicable costs, and disclosure of the legal effects of election to utilize arbitration.

PROCLAMATION 6857--DEC. 11, 1995

The courageous veterans who fought selflessly to bring an end to the war in the Pacific deserve our highest respect and our most profound gratitude. Today we honor the sacrifices that led to the uhimate victory--the triumph of freedom over tyranny. We also pay tribute to the families who contributed so much with their support, sacrifices, and prayers from the home front. A grateful Nation will long remember those who came home and those who did not.
In the post-Cold War era, it is vital that we pass along the lessons learned from Pearl Harbor to a new generation of Americans. We must never allow our country to be unprepared, and we must never again isolate ourselves from the problems of the world. This is the legacy we leave to our young people, and it is our responsibility to continue to teach them those lessons. By doing so, we reaffirm the values of democracy, freedom, and leadership that have made America great.
The Congress, by Public Law 103-308, has designated December 7, 1995, as "National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day."
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim December 7, 1995, as National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day. I urge all Americans to observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities in honor of the Americans who served at Pearl Harbor. I also ask all Federal departments and agencies, organizations, and individuals to fly the flag of the United States at half-staff on this day in honor of those Americans who died as a result of the attack on Pearl Harbor.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of December, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twentieth.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON

Proclamation 6857 of December 11,1995
To Modify the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, To Provide Rules of Origin Under the North American Free Trade Agreement for Affected Goods, and for Other Purposes
By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation 1. Section 1205(a) of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 ("the 1988 Act") (19 U.S.C. 3005(a)) directs the United States International Trade Commission ("the Commission") to keep the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States ("HTS") under continuous review and periodically to recommend to the President such modifications in the HTS as the Commission considers necessary or appropriate to accomplish the purposes set forth in that subsection.
2. Section 1206(a) of the 1988 Act (19 U.S.C. 3006(a)) authorizes the President to proclaim modifications to the HTS, based on the recommendations of the Commission under section 1205 of the 1988 Act

PROCLAMATION 6857--DEC. 11, 1995

109 STAT. 1865

(19 U.S.C. 3005), that he determines are in conformity with the obligations of the United States under the International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System ("the Convention") and do not run counter to the national economic interest of the United States.
3. (a) Presidential Proclamation No. 6641 of December 15, 1993, implemented the North American Free Trade Agreement ("the NAFTA") with respect to the United States and, pursuant to sections 201 and 202 of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act ("the NAFTA Implementation Act") (19 U.S.C. 3331 and 3332), incorporated in the HTS the tariff modifications and rules of origin necessary or appropriate to carry out the NAFTA.
(b) Because the substance of the changes to the Convention will be reflected in slightly differing form in the national tariff schedules of the three parties to the NAFTA, the rules of origin and interpretative rules set forth in Appendix 6.A of Annex 300-B, Annex 401, and other annexes to the NAFTA must be modified to ensure that the agreed tariff and certain other treatment accorded under the NAFTA to originating goods will continue to be provided under the tariff categories affected by the modifications to the Convention. The NAFTA parties agreed, on November 6, 1995, to the text of necessary revisions to the NAFTA.
4. Section 202 of the NAFTA Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. 3332) provides certain rules for determining whether goods imported into the United States originate in the territory of a NAFTA party and thus are eligible for the tariff and other treatment contemplated under the NAFTA. Section 202(q) of the NAFTA Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. 3332(q)) authorizes the President to proclaim the rules of origin set out in the NAFTA and any additional subordinate tariff categories necessary to carry out the NAFTA Implementation Act consistent with the NAFTA.
5. Pursuant to section 1206(a) of the 1988 Act (19 U.S.C. 3006(a)) and section 202 of the NAFTA Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. 3332), I have determined (1) that the modifications to the HTS being proclaimed pursuant to section 1206(a) of the 1988 Act are in conformity with the obligations of the United States under the Convention and do not run counter to the national economic interest of the United States; and (2) that the modifications to the HTS being proclaimed pursuant to section 202 of the NAFTA Implementation Act must be incorporated in the HTS in order to ensure that the tariff and certain other treatment accorded under the NAFTA will continue to be given to NAFTA originating goods. The report and lay-over requirements of section 1206(b) of the 1988 Act (19 U.S.C. 3006(b)) and section 202(q)(2) of the NAFTA Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. 3332(q)) have been complied with.
6. (a) Presidential Proclamation No. 6763 of December 23, 1994, implemented with respect to the United States the trade agreements resulting from the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, entered into pursuant to sections 1102(a) and (e) of the 1988 Act (19 U.S.C. 2902(a) and (e)), including Schedule XX--United States of America, annexed to the Marrakesh Protocol to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 ("Schedule XX"). Certain provisions set forth in annexes to that proclamation contain technical errors in the instructions for implementing particular changes.

PROCLAMATION 6857--DEC. 11, 1995

(b) Sections 1102(a) and (e) of the 1988 Act (19 U.S.C. 2902(a) and (e)) authorize the President to proclaim such modification or continuance of any existing duty, such continuance of existing duty-free or excise treatment, or such additional duties, as he determines to be required or appropriate to carry out any trade agreements entered into under those sections. Section 111(a) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act ("the URAA") (19 U.S.C. 3521(a)) authorizes the President to proclaim such other modification of any duty, such other staged rate reduction, or such additional duties as the President determines to be necessary or appropriate to carry out Schedule XX. To clarify the intent of the changes previously proclaimed, I have decided that such technical errors should be corrected.
7. Sec|;on 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended ("the 1974 Act") (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the substance of the relevant provisions of that Act, of other acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to section 604 of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2483), sections 1102, 1205, and 1206 of the 1988 Act (19 U.S.C. 2902, 3005, and 3006), sections 201 and 202 of the NAFTA Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. 3331 and 3332), and section 111(a) of the URAA (19 U.S.C. 3521(a)), do hereby proclaim:
(1) In order to modify the rules of origin under the NAFTA to reflect the amendments agreed to by the NAFTA parties, and to make certain conforming changes, the general notes to the HTS are modified as set forth in Annex I to this proclamation.
(2) In order to make changes in the HTS to conform it to the Convention or any amendment thereto recommended for adoption, to promote the uniform application of the Convention, to establish additional subordinate tariff categories to carry out modifications to the rules of origin under the NAFTA, and to make technical and conforming changes to existing provisions, the HTS is modified as set forth in Annex II to this proclamation.
(3) In order to provide for the continuation of previously proclaimed staged duty reductions in the Rates of Duty 1-General subcolumn under section 111(a) of the URAA (19 U.S.C. 3521(a)), as provided in Presidential ProclaAiation No. 6763 of December 23, 1994, for goods in the provisions modified in Annex II to this proclamation that are entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after the dates specified in section A of Annex III to this proclamation, the rate of duty in the HTS set forth in the Rates of Duty 1-General subcolumn for each of the HTS subheadings enumerated in section A of Annex III shall be deleted and the rate of duty provided in such section A inserted in lieu thereof.
(4) In order to provide for the continuation of previously proclaimed tariff modifications and staged duty reductions under section 201 of the NAFTA Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. 3331), as implemented with respect to the United States in Presidential Proclamation No. 6641 of December 15, 1993, for goods of Canada and of Mexico under the terms

of general note 12 to the HTS classifiable in the tariff provisions set forth in or affected by Annex II to this proclamation that are entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after the dates specified in sections B and C, respectively, of Annex III to this proclamation, the appropriate rate of duty in the HTS set forth in the Rates of Duty 1-Special subcolumn followed by the symbol "CA" or "MX", respectively, for each of the HTS subheadings enumerated in sections B and C of Annex III shall be deleted and the rate of duty provided in such sections inserted in lieu thereof.
(5) (a) In order to make technical corrections to certain provisions of the annexes to Presidential Proclamation No. 6763 of December 23, 1994, such provisions are modified as set forth in Annex IV to this proclamation.
(b) All provisions of previous proclamations and Executive orders inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are hereby superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.
(6) (a) The modifications to the HTS made by Annexes I and II to this proclamation shall be effective with respect to goods entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on and after the later of (i) January 1, 1996, or (ii) the date that is 15 days after the date of publication of this proclamation in the Fedesral Register.
(b) The modifications to the HTS made by Annexes III and IV to this proclamation shall be effective with respect to goods entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on and after the dates specified in such annexes to this proclamation for each action specified.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of December, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninetyfive, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twentieth.
