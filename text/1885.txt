"Art . 3. A sea going steamship, when under way, shall carry-- "(a) On or in front of the foremast, at a height above the hull of not less than twenty feet, and if the breadth of the ship exceeds twenty feet, then at a height above the hull not less than such breadth, a brigh t white light, so construc'ed as to show a uniform and unbroken light over an arc of the horizon of twenty points of the compass, so fixed as to throw the light ten points on each side of the ship, namely, from right ahead to two points abaft the beam on either side, and of such a character as to be visible on a dark night, with a clear atmosphere, at a distance of at least five miles. "(7>) On the starboard side a green light, so constructed as to show a uniform and unbroken light over an arc of ihe horizon of ten points of the compass, so fixed as to throw the light from right ahead to two points abaft the beam on the starboard side, and of such a character as to be visible on a dark night, with a clear atmosphere, at a distance of at least two miles. " (c) On the port side a red light, so constructed as to show a uniform and unbroken light over an arc of the horizon of ten points of the compass, so fixed as to throw the light from right ahead to two points abaft the beam on the port side, aud of such a character as to be visible on a dark night, with a clear atmosphere, at a distance of at least two miles. "(d) The said gieen and red side-lights shall be fitted with inboard screens projecting at least three feet forward from the light, so as to prevent these lights from being seen across the bow. "Art . 4. A steamship when towing another ship shall, in addition to her side-lights, carry two bright white lights in a vertical line, one over the other, not less than three feet apart, so as to distinguish her from other steamships. Each of these lights shall be of the same construction and character, and shall be carried in the same position, as the white light which other steamships are required to carry. "Art . 5 (a) A ship, whether a steamship or a sailingship, which from any accident is not under command, shall at night carry, in the same position as the white light which steamships are required to carry, and if a steamship, in place of that light, three red lights in globular lanterns, each not less than ten inches in diameter, in a vertical line, one over the other, not less than three feet apart, and of such a character as to be visible on a dark night, with a clear atmosphere, at a distance of at least two miles and shall by day carry in a vertical line, one over the other, not less than three feet apart, in front of but not lower than her foremast head, three black balls or shapes, each two feet in diameter. "(5) A ship, whether a steamship or a sailing-ship, employed in laying or in picking up a telegraph cable, shall at night carry, in the same position as the white light which steamships are required to carry, and if a steamship, in place of that light, three lights in globular lanterns, each

To make the use of these portable lights more certain and easy, the lanterns containing them shall each be painted outside with the color of the light they respectively contain, and shall be provided with proper screens.
"Art . 8. A ship, whether a steamship or a sailing-ship, when at anchor, shall carry, where it can best be seen, but at a height not exceeding twenty feet above the hull, a white light, in a globular lantern of not less than eight inches in diameter, and so constructed as to show a clear, uniform, and unbroken light, visible all round the horizon at a distance of at least one mile.

This article only applies to cases where ships are meeting end on, or nearly end on, in such a manner as to involve risk of collision, and does not apply to two ships which must, if both keep on their respective courses, pass clear of each other. The only cases to which it does apply are when each of the two ships is end on, or nearly end on, to the other; in other words, to cases in which by day each ship sees the masts of the other in a line, or nearly in a line, with her own, and by night to cases in which each ship is in such a position as to see both the sidelights of the other. It does not apply by day to cases in which a ship sees another ahead crossing her own course, or by night to cases where the red light of one ship is opposed to the red light of the other, or where the green light of one ship is opposed to the green light of the other, or where a red light without a green light, or a green light without a red light, is seen ahead, or where both green and red lights are seen anywhere but ahead.

Art . 18. Every steamship, when approaching another ship so as to involve risk of collision shall slacken her speed, or stop and reverse, if necessary.
"Art . 19. In taking any course authorized or required by these regulations, a steamship under way may indicate that course to any other ship which she has in sight by the following signals on her steam-
whistle, namely: " One short blast to mean ` I am directing my course to starboard.' " Two short blasts to mean ` I am directing my course to port.' ·· Three short blasts to mean ` I am going full speed astern.'

A PROCLAMATION.

Whereas certain portions of the Cheyenne and Arapahoe Indian Reservation in the Indian Territory, are occupied by persons other than Indians who claim the right to keep and graze cattle thereon, by agreement made with the Indians for whose special possession and occu-

pancy the said lands have been reserved by the Government of the United States, or under other pretexts and licences :

And whereas all such agreements and licenses are deemed void and of no effect, and the persons so occupying said lands with cattle are considered unlawfully upon the domain of the United States so reserved as aforesaid:

And whereas the claims of such persons under said leases and licenses, and their unauthorized presence upon such reservation, have caused

complaint and discontent on the part of the Indians located thereon, and are likely to cause serious outbreaks and disturbances;

Now therefore, I, Grover Cleveland, President of the United States do hereby order and direct that all persons other than Indians, who are now upon any part of said reservation for the purpose of grazing cattle

thereon, and their servants and agents, and all other unauthorized persons now upon said reservation, do within forty days from the date of this Proclamation, depart and entirely remove therefrom with their cattle, horses, and other property.

In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.

The President of the United States has just received the sad tidings of the death of that illustrious citizen and ex-President of the United States, General Ulysses S. Grant, at Mount McGregor, in the State of New York, to which place he had lately been removed in the endeavour to prolong his life.
In making this announcement to the people of the United States, the President is impressed with the magnitude of the public loss of a great military leader, who was in the hour of victory magnanimous; amid disaster, serene and self-sustained; who in every station, whether as a soldier, or as a Chief Magistrate twice called to power by his fellow countrymen, trod unswervingly the pathway of duty, undeterred by doubts, single-minded and straight forward.
The entire country has witnessed with deep emotion his prolonged and patient struggle with painful disease, and has watched by his couch of suffering with tearful sympathy.
The destined end has come at last, and his spirit has returned to the Creator who sent it forth.
The great heart of the Nation that followed him when living with love and pride, bows now in sorrow above him dead, tenderly mindful of his virtues, his great patriotic services, and of the loss occasioned by his death.
In testimony of respect to the memory of General Grant, it is ordered that the Executive Mansion and the several Departments at Washing ton be draped in mourning for a period' of thirty days and that all public business shall, on the day of the funeral, be suspended; and the Secretaries of War and of the Navy will, cause orders to be issued for appropriate military and naval honors to be rendered on that day.
In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.

Preamble.
November 26, 1885, set apart as a day of public Thanksgiving.

The American People have always abundant cause to be thankful to Almighty God, whose watchful care and guiding hand have been manifested in every stage of their national life--guarding and protecting them in time of peril, and safely leading them in the hour of darkness
and of danger. It is fitting and proper that a nation thus favored, should on one day
in every year, for that purpose especially appointed, publicly acknowledge the goodness of God, and return thanks to Him for all His gra-
cious gifts. Therefore I, Grover Cleveland, President of the United States of
America, do hereby designate and set apart Thursday the twenty-sixth day of November instant, as a day of public thanksgiving and prayer ; and do invoke the observance of the same by all the people of the laud.
On that day let all secular business be suspended. And let the people assemble in their usual places of worship, and with prayer and songs of praise, devoutly testify their gratitude to the Giver of every good and perfect gift for all that He has done for us in the year that has passed ; for our preservation as a united nation and for our deliverance from the shock and danger of political convulsion; for the blessings of peace and for our safety and quiet while wars and rumors of wars have agitated and afflicted other nations of the earth; for our security against the scourge of pestilence, which in other lands has claimed its dead by thousands and filled thé streets with mourners; for plenteous crops which reward the labor of the husbandman and increase our nation's wealth ; and for the contentment throughout our borders which follows
in the train of prosperity and abundance. And let there also be on the day thus set apart, a reunion of fami-
lies, sanctified and chastened by tender memories and associations; and

PROCLAMATIONS. Nos. 5, 6. let the social intercourse of friends, with pleasant reminiscence, renew the ties of affection and strengthen the bonds of kindly feeling.
And let us by no means forget while we give thanks and enjoy the comforts which have crowned our lives that truly grateful hearts are inclined to deeds of charity, and that a kind and thoughtful remembrance of the poor will double the pleasures of our condition and render our praise and thanksgiving more acceptable in the sight of the Lord.

A PROCLAMATION.

Whereas it is represented to me by the Governor of the Territory of Washington that domestic violence exists within the said Territory, and that by reason of unlawful obstructions and combinations and the assemblage of evil-disposed persons ithas become impracticable to enforce by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings the laws of the United States at Seattle and at other points and places within said Territory, whereby life and property are there threatened and endangered,
And whereas the Legislature of said Territory cannot be convened, and in the judgment of the President an emergency has arisen and a case is now presented which justifies and requires under the Constitution and laws of the United States the employment of military force to suppress domestic violence and enforce the faithful execution of the laws of the United States, if the command and warning of this Proclamation be disobeyed or disregarded :
Now, therefore, I, Grover Cleveland, President of the United States of America, do hereby command and warn all insurgents and all persons who have assembled at any point within the said Territory of Washington, for the unlawful purposes aforesaid, to desist therefrom, and to disperse and retire peaceably to their respective abodes on or before twelve o'clock meridian on the eighth day of November instant;
And I do admonish all good citizens of the United States and all persons within the limits and jurisdiction thereof against aiding, abetting, countenancing, or taking any part in such unlawful acts or assemblages.

September 9,1885.

Whereas satisfactory evidence has been received by me that upon vessels of the United States arriving at the port of Boca del Toro, United States of Colombia, no duty is imposed by the ton as tonnage tax or as light money, and that no other equivalent tax on vessels of the United States is imposed at said port by the Colombian Government, and whereas by the provisions of section fourteen of an Act approved June 26th 1884, "to remove certain burdens on the American merchant marine and encourage the American foreign carrying trade, and for other purposes" the President of the United States is authorized to suspend the collection in ports of the United States from ves-

A PROCLAMATION.

Preamble.
November 26, 1885, set apart as a day of public Thanksgiving.

The American People have always abundant cause to be thankful to Almighty God, whose watchful care and guiding hand have been manifested in every stage of their national life--guarding and protecting them in time of peril, and safely leading them in the hour of darkness
and of danger. It is fitting and proper that a nation thus favored, should on one day
in every year, for that purpose especially appointed, publicly acknowledge the goodness of God, and return thanks to Him for all His gra-
cious gifts. Therefore I, Grover Cleveland, President of the United States of
America, do hereby designate and set apart Thursday the twenty-sixth day of November instant, as a day of public thanksgiving and prayer ; and do invoke the observance of the same by all the people of the laud.
On that day let all secular business be suspended. And let the people assemble in their usual places of worship, and with prayer and songs of praise, devoutly testify their gratitude to the Giver of every good and perfect gift for all that He has done for us in the year that has passed ; for our preservation as a united nation and for our deliverance from the shock and danger of political convulsion; for the blessings of peace and for our safety and quiet while wars and rumors of wars have agitated and afflicted other nations of the earth; for our security against the scourge of pestilence, which in other lands has claimed its dead by thousands and filled thé streets with mourners; for plenteous crops which reward the labor of the husbandman and increase our nation's wealth ; and for the contentment throughout our borders which follows
in the train of prosperity and abundance. And let there also be on the day thus set apart, a reunion of fami-
lies, sanctified and chastened by tender memories and associations; and

PROCLAMATIONS. Nos. 5, 6. let the social intercourse of friends, with pleasant reminiscence, renew the ties of affection and strengthen the bonds of kindly feeling.
And let us by no means forget while we give thanks and enjoy the comforts which have crowned our lives that truly grateful hearts are inclined to deeds of charity, and that a kind and thoughtful remembrance of the poor will double the pleasures of our condition and render our praise and thanksgiving more acceptable in the sight of the Lord.

A PROCLAMATION.

Whereas it is represented to me by the Governor of the Territory of Washington that domestic violence exists within the said Territory, and that by reason of unlawful obstructions and combinations and the assemblage of evil-disposed persons ithas become impracticable to enforce by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings the laws of the United States at Seattle and at other points and places within said Territory, whereby life and property are there threatened and endangered,
And whereas the Legislature of said Territory cannot be convened, and in the judgment of the President an emergency has arisen and a case is now presented which justifies and requires under the Constitution and laws of the United States the employment of military force to suppress domestic violence and enforce the faithful execution of the laws of the United States, if the command and warning of this Proclamation be disobeyed or disregarded :
Now, therefore, I, Grover Cleveland, President of the United States of America, do hereby command and warn all insurgents and all persons who have assembled at any point within the said Territory of Washington, for the unlawful purposes aforesaid, to desist therefrom, and to disperse and retire peaceably to their respective abodes on or before twelve o'clock meridian on the eighth day of November instant;
And I do admonish all good citizens of the United States and all persons within the limits and jurisdiction thereof against aiding, abetting, countenancing, or taking any part in such unlawful acts or assemblages.
In witness whereof, I have set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be hereunto affixed.

Until the contrary is proved, the responsibility rests with the Administration which, after having received the article without making any remark, can not prove either its delivery to the addressee, or its regular transmission to the next Administration.
The payment of the indemnity by the despatching office should be made as soon as possible, and at the latest, within the period of one year dating from the day of the reclamation. The responsible office is bound to reimburse without delay to the despatching office the amount of the indemnity paid by it.
It it understood that the reclamation is only admitted within the period of one year from the time when the registered article was mailed; after this period has passed, the claimant has no right to any indemnity.

Si la perte a eu lieu. en cours de transport entre les bureaux d'echange de deux pays limitroph.es, sans qu'il soit possible d'etablir sur lequel des deux territoires le fait s'est accompli, les deux Administrations en cause supportent le dommage par moitie.
Les Administrations cessent d'etre responsables des envois recommandes dont les ayant droit ont donne regu et pris livraison.
Par mesure de transition, il est permis aux Administrations des pays hors d'Europe, dont la legislation est actuellement contraire au principe de la responsabilite, d'ajourner 1'application de la clause qui precede jusqu'au jour on elles auront pu obtenir, du pouvoir Iegislatif, 1'autorisation d'y souscrire. Jusqu'a ce moment, les autres Administrations de 1'Union ne sont pas astreintes a payer une indemnity pour la perte, dans leurs services respectifs, d'envois recommandes a destination on provenant desdits pays.

If the loss has occurred during transportation between the exchange offices of two neighboring countries, and it is impossible to ascertain on which of the two territories it has taken place, the two Administrations concerned bear the loss in equal proportions.

The Administrations cease to be responsible for registered articles, the addressees of which have given a receipt for them and have accepted them.
As a temporary measure, the Administrations of the countries beyond Europe, whose legislation is at present opposed to the principle of responsibility, are permitted to postpone the application of the preceding clause until the time when they shall have obtained, from the legislative power, authority to subscribe to it. Up to that time, the other Administrations of the Union are not bound to pay an indemnity for the loss, in their respective services, of registered articles addressed to or originating in the said countries.

and correction of addresses.

1. --Pour les demandes de retrait de correspondances ou de rectification d'adresses,l'expediteur doit faire usage d'une formule conforme au modele H. annexe an present Reglement. En remettant cette reclamation au bureau de poste, I'expediteur doit y justifier de son identity. Apres la justification, dont I'Administration du pays d'origine assume la responsabilite, il est procede de la maniere suivante:
1°. Si la demande est destinee a etre transmise par voie "postale", la formule, accompagnee d'un facsimile parfait de la lettre a recherche, est expedite directement, sous pli recommande, au bureau de poste destinataire;
2°. Si la demande doit etre faite par voie telegraphique, la formule est deposee au service telegraphique charge d'en transmettre les termes au bureau de poste destinataire.
2. --A la reception de la formule H. ou du telegramme en tenant lieu, le bureau de poste destinataire recherche la correspondance signalee et donne a la demande la suite necessaire.
Toutefois, s'il s'agit d'un changement d'adresse par voie telegraphique, le bureau destinataire se borne a retenir la lettre et attend, pour faire droit a la demande, 1'arrivde du fac-simile necessaire.
Si la recherche est infructueuse, si Tobjet a deja ete remis au destinataire, ou sila demande par voie telegraphique n'est pas assez explicite pour permettre de reconnaitre surement Tobjet de correspondance indique, le fait est signale immediatement au bureau d'origine, qui en previent le reclamant.
3. --A moins d'entente contraire, la formule H est redigee en frangais ou porte une traduction sublineaire en cette langue, et, dans le cas d'emploi de la voie telegraphique, le telegramme est formule en langue frangaise.

1. --For requests for withdrawal of correspondence or for correction of addresses, the sender must use a form like model H, annexed to the present Regulations. In transmitting this request to the post-office, the sender must there establish his identity. After identification, the responsibility for which is assumed by the Administration of the country of origin, the following course is pursued:

Withdrawing correspondence or correcting addresses.

1st. If the request is to be transmitted by mail, the form, accompanied by a perfect fac-simile of the letter asked for, is forwarded direct, under registration, to the post-office of destination;

Request by mail.

2nd. If the request is to be made Request by tele-
graph.
by telegraph, the form is handed to the telegraph service which is charged to transmit its contents to the post-office of destination.

2. --Upon the receipt of form H., or of the telegram taking its place, the office of destination institutes an inquiry for the correspondence indicated, and complies with the request.
If, however, an alteration of the address is requested by telegraph, the office of destination confines itself to retaining the letter and waits for the arrival of the necessary fac-simile, before complying with the request.
If the inquiry is without result, if the article has already been delivered to the addressee, or if the request by telegraph is not explicit enough to allow the article of correspondence indicated to be recognized with certainty, the fact is immediately made known to the office of origin,which informs the claimant.
3. --Unless a different arrangement has been entered into, the form H is made out in French or bears an interlinear translation in that language, and, in case the telegraph is used, the telegram is written in the French language.

In the event of the annulment of any awards made by the former Mixed Commission under the Convention of April 25, 1866, the Government of the United States is not to be regarded as responsible to that of Venezuela for any sums which may have been paid by the latter Government on account of said awards, so far as said sums may have been distributed. In like manner, if the awards made by the present Commission and the certificates issued by it shall in any cases be found less than the amount heretofore paid to the claimants from the moneys received fromVen-
ezuela, the Government of the United States shallnot be regarded as responsible by reason thereof to
the Government of Venezuela. The rehearing provided in the
present convention affects, as against the Government of the United States, only the installments of moneys paid to and now held by the United States, and those hereafter to be paid; and the effect of such annulment or reduction in any case shall be to discharge the Government of Venezuela, wholly and forever, from
any obligation to pay further installments in such case, except as provided in the present convention.

En el evento de la anulacion de cualesquiera fallos de la anterior comision mixta, bajo la convencion de Abril 25 de 1866, el Gobierno de

It is further agreed that if the commission, hereunder organized shall in whole or part annul any money awards made in any cases by the former Mixed Commission under the Convention of April 25, 1866, it shall be the duty of the Commission to examine and decide whether, under all the circumstances, and with due regard to principles ofjustice and equity there are any third parties who have, with the observance of due care and diligence, become possessed, prior to the date of the exchange of ratifications hereof, for a just and valuable consideration, of any portion of the certificates of award heretofore issued in said claims, and whether, under the constitution or laws of either of the contracting
parties, said third parties have acquired vested rights, by virtue of the awards of the former Commission under the Convention of 1866, imposing the duty on the Government of the United States to collect from Venezuela the amount or proportion of said certificates of awards which may be held and owned by third parties.

Awards to preserve vested rights of third parties.

If the present Commission shall decide that there are third parties who are possessed of vested rights, then it shall examine and ascertain the sum paid by each and all of said third parties for their respective interests or shares in said awards, and shall fix the amount of their said interest in said certificates of award or each of them, and shall issue new certificates of award for the sums so adjudged due, which shall be paid by Venezuela to the United States in the manner hereinbefore stipulated, the same as all other certificates issued by the present Commission.
