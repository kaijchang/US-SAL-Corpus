A PROCLAMATION.
While quarantine regulations are committed to the several States, the General Government has reposed certain powers in the President to be used at his discretion in preventing a threatened epidemic.
Feeling it my duty, I hereby call upon all persons who, under existing systems in the several States , are intrusted with the execution of quarantine regulations, to be diligent and on the alert in order to prevent the introduction of the pestilence which, we all regret to learn, has made its appearance in some of the countries of Europe between which and the ports of the United States intercourse is direct and frequent.
I further advise that the cities and towns of the United States, whether on the coast or on the lines of interior communication, by sound sanitary regulations and the promotion of cleanliness, be prepared to resist the power of the disease and to mitigate its severity.
And I further direct the consuls of the United States in the ports where the pestilence has made or may make its appearance to exercise vigilance in carrying out the instructions heretofore given and in communicating to the Government of the United States any information of value relating to the progress or treatment of the disease.

have determined after a careful examination of the several treaties, acts
