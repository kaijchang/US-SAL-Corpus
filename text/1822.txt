He must exercise his judgment in expounding the laws and resolutions of Congress, under which he is required, from time to time, to act.

Cha p. XCI.--An Act fixing the compensation of the commissioner of the public buildings, (a)
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America, in Congress assembled, That instead of the salary of two thousand dollars, heretofore allowed by law to the commissioner of the public buildings, there shall henceforth be allowed to the said commissioner a salary of one thousand five hundred dollars a year, to be paid quarterly, out of any moneys in the treasury not otherwise appropriated.
Sec . 2. And be it further enacted, That the said commissioner shall

for the President, unless their duties were regarded as executive, in which judgment and discretion were

to be exercised. Decatur v. Paulding, Secretary of the Navy, 14 Peters, 497.

If a suit should come before the Supreme Court of the United States, which involved the construc-

tion of any of the laws imposing duties on the heads of the executive departments, the court would

not certainly be bound to adopt the construction given by the head of a department; and if they sup-

posed the decision to be wrong, they would, of course, so pronounce their judgment. But the judg-

ment of the court upon the construction of a law, must be given in a case in which they have jurisdic-

tion, and in which it is their duty to interpret the act of Congress, in order to ascertain the rights of the

parties in the cause before them. The court could not entertain an appeal from the decision of one of

the secretaries, nor revise his judgment in any case where the law authorized him to exercise his dis-

cretion or judgment. Nor can it, by mandamus, act directly upon the officer, or guide and control his

judgment or discretion in the matters committed to his care, in the ordinary discharge of his official

duties. The interference of the court with the performance of the ordinary duties of the executive de-

partments of the government, would be productive of nothing but mischief; and this power was never

intended to be given to them. Ibid.

(a) By the act of May 2, 1828, " An act making appropriations for the public buildings, and for other

purposes," passed May 2, 1828, ch. 45, sec. 3, the commissioner of public buildings is required to reside

near the Capitol; and by the third section of the act making appropriations for public buildings, passed

March 3, 1829, ch. 51, the commissioner is required to report annually to Congress the manner in which

all appropriations for the public buildings and grounds have been expended.

By the act of 1843, ch. 75, an act to fix the compensation of the commissioner of public buildings,

the compensation of the commissioner was fixed at two thousand dollars per annum, and no portion of

the appropriation for public buddings and grounds to be applied to the payment of clerks, unless the

same be expressly provided for in the act.

Cha p. XC VI.--An Act to authorize and empower the corporation of the city of
Washington, in the District of Columbia, to drain the low grounds on and
near the public reservations, and to improve and ornament certain parts of such
reservation, (a)
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America, in Congress assembled, That it shall be lawful for the mayor, aidermen, and common council, of the city of Washington, under the direction of the President of the United States, and the said corporation is hereby authorized, when they shall deem it necessary, to contract with the Washington Canal Company, and obtain their consent, to change the present location of such parts of the canal, passing through the said city, as lies between Second and Seventh streets west, into such other course as shall most effectually, in their opinion, drain and dry the low grounds lying on the borders of Tyber creek.
Sec . 2." And be it further enacted, That, to effect the object aforesaid, and to fill up the low grounds on the borders of the said canal, in such manner as they may provide by law, the said corporation is hereby authorized and empowered, after having extended the public reservation, designated on the plan of the said city as number ten, so as the whole south side thereof shall bind on the line of Pennsylvania avenue; and after having caused to be divided the said public reservation numbered ten, except such part thereof as has already been sold, and also the public reservations numbered eleven and twelve, into building lots, to sell and dispose of the right of the United States of, in, and to, the said lots, or any number thereof, laid off as aforesaid, at public sale, on such conditions of improvement, and on such terms, as the said corporation shall prescribe: and the said corporation is further authorized and empowered, for the purposes specified in this act, to cause to be laid off, in such manner as the President of the United States may approve of, two squares, south of Pennsylvania avenue, between Third, and Sixth streets west, to front on the line of said avenue from the junction of said Sixth street west, and the said avenue, to the junction of Third street west with said avenue; and also to lay off, north of Maryland avenue, two uniform and correspondent squares, and the said four squares, when so laid off, to divide into building lots, and to sell and dispose of the right of the United States,

Statute I.

The corporation of Washington, under direction of the President, authorized to contract with the Washington Canal Company, and to change the location, &c.
The corporation empowered, after having extended the public reservation, and caused the public reservations, &c. to be divided into building lots, to sell the right of the United States to such lots, at public sale, &c.
The corporation further authorized to lay off four squares, divide them into building lots, and to dispose of the right of the United States to such lots, at public sale, &c.

(a) In 1822 Congress passed an act, authorizing the corporation of Washington to drain the ground in and near certain public reservations, and to improve and ornament certain parts of the public reservations. The corporation are empowered to make an agreement, by which parts of the location of the
canal shall be changed, for the purpose of draining and drying the low grounds near the Pennsylvania avenue, &c. To effect these objects, the corporation is authorized to lay off, in building lots, certain parts of the public reservations, No. 10, 11, and 12, and of other squares, and also a part of B street, as
laid out and designated in the original plan of the city, which lots they may sell at auction, and apply the proceeds to those objects, and afterwards to enclosing, planting, and improving other reservations,
and building bridges, &c., the surplus, if any, to be paid into the treasury of the United States. The act authorizes the heirs, &c., of the former proprietors of the land, on which the city was laid out, who may consider themselves injured by the purposes of the act, to institute in the circuit court, a bill in
equity, in the nature of a petition of right against the United States, setting forth the grounds of any claim they may consider themselves entitled to make, to be conducted according the rules of a court of
equity ; the court to hear and determine upon the claim of the plaintiffs, and what portion, if any, of the
money arising from the sale of the lots they may be entitled to, with a right of appeal to the SupremeCourt. The plaintiffs, Van Ness and wife, filed their bill against the United States and the corporation of Washington, claiming title to the lots which had been thus sold, under David Burns, the original proprietor
of that part of the city, and father of one of the plaintiffs, on the ground, that, by the agreement between the United States and the original proprietors, upon laying out the city, those reservations and streets were forever to remain for public use, and without the consent of the proprietors could not be otherwise appropriated or sold for private use; that the act of Congress was a violation of the contract; that by such sale and appropriation for private use, the right of the United States thereto was determined, or that the original proprietors re-acquired a right to have the reservations, &c., laid out in building lots,
for their joint and equal benefit with the United States, or that they were in equity, entitled to the whole or a moiety of the proceeds of the sales of the lots. Held, that no rights or claims exist in the former proprietors or their heirs; and that the proceedings of the corporation of Washington, under and
in conformity with the provisions of the act, are valid and effectual for the purposes of the act. Van Ness and wife v. The Mayor of Washington, and the United States, 4 Peters, 232.

Florida, have been :

., _ .

After the acquisition of Florida by the United States, in virtue of the treaty with Spam, ot 22d ot

February, 1819, various acts of Congress were passed for the adjustment of private land claims, within

the ceded territory. The tribunals authorized to decide on them, were not authorized to settle any

which exceeded a league square ; on those exceeding that quantity, they were directed to report, espe-

cially, their opinion, for the future action of Congress. The lands embraced in the larger claims were

defined by surveys, and plats retained ; these were reserved from sale, and remained unsettled until some

resolution should be adopted for a final adjudication of them, which was done by the passage of the law

of the 22d of May, 1828. By the sixth section it was provided, " that all claims to land within the ter-

ritory of Florida, embraced by the treaty, which shall not be finally decided and settled under the pro-

visions of the same law, containing a greater quantity of land than the commissioners were authorized

to decide, and above the amount confirmed by the act, and which have not been reported as antedated,

or forged, shall be received and adjudicated by the judges of the superior court of the district in which

the land lies, upon the petition of the claimant, according to the forms, rules and regulations, conditions,

restrictions and regulations prescribed to the district judge, and to the claimants, by the act of 2oth May,

1824. By a proviso, all claims annulled by the treaty, and all claims not presented to the commission-

ers, &c., according to the acts of Congress were excluded. United States v. Arredondo etal. 6 Peters, 706.

The grant of the king of Spain to F. M. Arredondo and Son, for land at Alachua, in Florida, gave

a valid title to these claimants under the grant, according to the stipulations under the treaty between

the United States and Spain, of 1819. By the laws of nations, of the United States, and of Spain, a con-

cession or condition becomes absolute, where the condition is performed. Ibid. 691. The original concession by governor Coppinger, on the petition of George J. F. Clarke, was made,

on the 17th of December, 1817, of twenty-six thousand acres of land, in the places he solicited in his

petition, and a complete title was made of twenty-two thousand acres, part of the same, in December,

1817. Twenty thousand acres, part of the whole concession, were sold by the appellee. The other

four thousand were surveyed in conformity with the decree of 17th December, 1817, and a complete title

to the same was made by governor Coppinger, on the 4th of May, 1818. By the court The claimant

cannot avail himself of the grant of the 4th of May, 1818, made after the 24th of January, 1818, the time

limited by the Florida treaty. He must rest his claim on the concession made on the 17th of December,

1817, United States v. Clarke, 8 Peters, 436.

., .

The validity of concessions of land, by the authorities of Spain, in East Florida, is expressly recog-

nised in the Florida treaty, and in the several acts of Congress. Ibid. The eighth article allows the owners of land the same time for fulfilling the conditions of their grants

from the date of the treaty, as is allowed in the grant from the date of the instrument. And the act ot

the 8th of May, 1822, requires every person claiming title to lands under any patent, grant, concession,

or order of survey dated previous to the 24th of January, 1818, to file his claim before the commission-

ers, appointed in pursuance of that act. All the subsequent acts on the subject, observe the same lan-

guage"; and the titles under these concessions have been uniformly confirmed, when the tract did not

exceed a league square. Ibid. A claim to lands in East Florida, the title to which was derived from grants by the Creek and
Seminole Indians, ratified by the local authorities of Spain, before the cession of Florida by Spain to
the United States, confirmed. Mitchel et al. v. The United States, 9 Peters, 711. It was objected to the title claimed in this case, which had been presented to the superior court of
Middle Florida, under the provisions of the acts of Congress for the settlement of land claims in Florida, that the grantees did not acquire, under the Indian grants, a legal title to the land. Held: that the acts of Congress submit these claims to the adjudication of this court as a court of equity; and those acts, as often and uniformly construed in its repeated decisions, confer the same jurisdiction over imperfect, inchoate and inceptive titles, as legal and perfect ones; and require the court to decide by the same
rules on all claims submitted to it, whether legal or equitable. Ibid. In the case of the United States v. Arredondo, 6 Peters, 691, the lands granted had been in the posses-
sion and occupation of the Alachua Indians, and the centre of the tract was an Indian town of that name. But the land had been abandoned, and before any grant was made by the intendant, a report was made by the attorney and surveyor general on a reference to them, finding the fact of abandonment; on which it was decreed that the lands had reverted to, and become annexed to the royal domain. Ibid.
By the common law, the king has no right of entry on lands which is not common to his subjects ; the king is put to his inquest of office, or information of intrusion, in all cases where a subject is put to his action ; their right is the same, though the king has more convenient remedies in enforcing his. If the king has no original right of possession to lands, he cannot acquire it without office found, so as to
annex it to his domain. Ibid. The United States have acted on the same principle in the various laws which Congress have passed
in relation to private claims to lands in the Floridas ; they have not undertaken to decide for themselves, on the validity of such claims, without the previous action of some tribunal, special or judicial. They have not authorized an entry to be made on the possession of any person in possession, by colour of a Spanish grant or title; nor the sale of any lands as part of the national domain ; with any intention to impair private rights. The laws which give jurisdiction to the district courts of the territories to decide in the first instance, and to this court on appeal, prescribe the mode by which lands which have been possessed or claimed to have been granted pursuant to the Jaws of Spain, shall become a part of the national domain; which, as declared in the seventh section of the act of 1824, is a " final decision against any
claimant pursuant to any of the provisions of the law." Ibid.

missioners for ascertaining claims and titles
to lands in Florida.

ascertaining the claims and titles to lands within the territory of Florida, as acquired by the treaty of the twenty-second of February, one thousand eight hundred and nineteen, there shall be appointed, by the President of the United States, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate,

One uniform rule seems to have prevailed in the British provinces in America, by which Indian lands were held and sold, from their first settlement, as appears by their laws; that friendly Indians were pro-

tected in the possession of the lands they occupied, and were considered as owning them by a perpetual right of possession in the tribe or nation inhabiting them as their common property, from generation to

generation, not as the right of the individuals located on particular spots. Subject to this right of pos-

session, the ultimate fee was in the crown and its grantees; which could be granted by the crown or colonial legislatures while the lands remained in possession of the Indians; though possession could not

be taken without their consent. Ibid. Individuals could not purchase Indian lands without permission or license from the crown, colonial
governors, or according to the rules prescribed by colonial laws ; but such purchases were valid with such

license, or in conformity with the local laws ; and by this union of the perpetual right of occupancy with the ultimate fee, which passed from the crown by the license, the title of the purchaser became com-

plete. Ibid. Indian possession or occupation was considered with reference to their habits and modes of life ; their

hunting grounds were as much in their actual possession as the cleared fields of the whites ; and their rights to its exclusive enjoyment in their own way, and for their own purposes, were as much respected until they abandoned them, made a cession to the government, or an authorized sale to individuals. In either case their rights became extinct, the lands could be granted disencumbered of the right of occupancy, or enjoyed in full dominion by the purchases from the Indians. Such was the tenure of Indian lands by the laws of Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,

Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. Ibid. Grants made by the Indians at public councils, since the treaty at Fort Stanwick's, have been made
directly to the purchasers, or to the state in which the land lies, in trust for them, or with directions

to convey to them ; of which there are many instances of large tracts so sold and held; especially in

New York. Ibid. It was the universal rule that purchases made at Indian treaties, in the presence, and with the appro-

bation of the officer under whose direction they were held by the authority of the crown, gave a valid title to the lands ; it prevailed under the laws of the states after the revolution ; and yet continues in

those where the right to the ultimate fee is owned by the states, or their grantees. It has been adopted by the United States : and purchases made at treaties held by their authority, have been always held

good by the ratification of the treaty, without any patent to the purchasers from the United States. This rule in the colonies was founded on a settled rule of the law of England, that by his prerogative the king

was the universal occupant of all vacant lands in his dominions, and had the right to grant them at his

pleasure, or by his authorized officers. Ibid. When the United States acquired and took possession of the Floridas, the treaties which had been
made with the Indian tribes before the acquisition of the territory by Spain and Great Britain, remained in force over all the ceded territory as the laws which regulated the relations with all the Indians who

were parties to them ; and were binding on the United States, by the obligation they had assumed by the Louisiana treaty, as a supreme law of the land, which was inviolable by the power of Congress. They were also binding as the fundamental law of Indian rights, acknowledged by royal orders, and municipal regulations of the provinces, as the laws and ordinances of Spain in the ceded provinces, which

were declared to continue in force by the proclamation of the governor in taking possession of the province; and by the acts of Congress which assured all the inhabitants of protection in their property. It

would be an unwarranted construction of these treaties, laws, ordinances and municipal regulations, to decide that the Indians were not to be maintained in the enjoyment of all the rights which they could have enjoyed under either, had the province remained under the dominion of Spain. It would be rather

a perversion of their spirit, meaning and terms, contrary to the injunction of the law under which the court acts, which makes the stipulations of any treaty, the laws and ordinances of Spain ; ana these acts

of Congress, so far as either apply to this case, the standard rules for its decision. Ibid. The treaties with Spain and England before the acquisition of Florida by the United States, which

guarantied to the Seminole Indians their lands according to the right of property with which they possessed them, were adopted by the United States; who thus became the protectors of all the rights they had previously enjoyed, or could of right enjoy under Great Britain or Spain, as individuals or nations,

by any treaty, to which the United States thus became parties in 1803. Ibid. ' The Indian right to the lands as property was not merely of possession, that of alienation was con-
comitant ; both were equally secured, protected, and guarantied by Great Britain and Spain, subject only to ratification and confirmation by the license, charter or deed from the governor representing the king. Such purchases enabled the Indians to pay their debts, compensate for their depredations on the traders

resident among them, to provide for their wants ; while they were available to the purchasers as payment of the considerations which at their expense had been received by the Indians. It would have been a violation of the faith of the government to both, to encourage traders to settle in the province, to put

themselves and property in the power of the Indians, to suffer the latter to contract debts, and when willing to pay them by the only means in their power, a cession of their lands, withhold an assent to the

purchase, which by their laws or municipal regulations was necessary to vest a title. Such a course was

never adopted by Great Britain in any of her colonies ; nor by Spain in Louisiana or Florida. Ibid. The laws made it necessary, when the Indians sold their lands, to have the deeds presented to the

governor for confirmation. The sales by the Indians transferred the kind of right which they possessed; the ratification of the sale by the governor must be regarded as a relinquishment of the title of the crown

to the purchaser; and no instance is known where permission to sell has been " refused, o.r of the rejec-

tion of an Indian sale." Ibid.

,

In the present case the Indian sale has been confirmed with more than usual solemnity and publicity ;

it has been done at a public council and convention of the Indians conformably to treaties, to which the

three commissioners, who shall receive, as compensation for the duties enjoined by the provisions of this act, two thousand dollars each, to be paid quarterly, from the treasury; who shall open an office for the adjudication of claims, at Pensacola, in the territory of West Florida, and St.

Their pay. To open an office at Pensacola.

king was a party, and which the United States adopted; and the grant was known to both parties to the treaty of cession. The United States were not deceived by the purchase, which they knew was subject
to the claim of the petitioner, or those from whom he purchased; and they made no stipulation which should put it to a severer test than any other; and it was made to a house which, in consideration of its great and continued services to the king and his predecessor, had deservedly given them high claims as
well on his justice as his faith. But if there could be a doubt that the evidence in the record did not establish the fact of a royal license or assent to this purchase, as a matter of specific and judicial belief, it would be presumed as a matter of law arising from the facts and circumstances of the case, which are
admitted or unquestioned. Ibid. As decided by the Supreme Court, the law presumes the existence in the provinces of an officer
authorized to make valid grants ; a fortiori, to give license to purchase and to confirm ; and the treaty
designates the governor of West Florida as the proper officer to make grants of Indian lands by confirmation ; as plainly as it does the governor of East Florida to make original grants, or the intendant of West Florida to grant royal lands. A direct grant from the crown, of lands in a royal haven may be
presumed on an uninterrupted possession of sixty years; on a prescriptive possession of crown lands for forty years. Ibid.
The length of time which brings a given case within the legal presumption of a grant, charter or license, to validate a right long enjoyed, is not definite, depending on its peculiar circumstances. Ibid.
Juan Percheman claimed two thousand acres of land lying in the territory of Florida, by virtue of a
grant from the Spanish governor, made in 1815. His title consisted of a petition presented by himself to the governor of East Florida, praying for a grant of two thousand acres, at a designated place, in pursuance of the royal order of the 29th of March, 1815, granting lands to the military who were in St.
Augustine during the invasion of 1812 and 1813; a decree by the governor, made 12th December, 1815, in conformity to the petition, in absolute property, under the authority of the royal order, a certified
copy of which decree and of the petition was directed to be issued to him from the secretary's office,
in order that it may be to him in all events an equivalent of a title in form ; a petition to the governor, dated 31st December, 1815, for an order of survey, and a certificate of a survey having been made on the 20th of August, 1819, in obedience to the same. This claim was presented, according to law,
to the register and receiver of East Florida, while acting as a board of commissioners to ascertain claims and titles to lands in East Florida. The claim was rejected by the board, and the following entry made
of the same. " In the memorial of the claimant to this board, he speaks of a survey made by authority in 1829. If this had been produced, it would have furnished some support for the certificate of Aguilar.
As it is, we reject the claim." Held, that this was not a final action on the claim, in the sense those words are used in the act of the 26th of May, 1830, entitled "An act supplementary to," &c. United
States v. Percheman, 7 Peters, 51. A grant of land in Florida within the Indian boundary, by the governor, acting under the crown of
Spain before the cession of Florida to the United States, was confirmed to the grantee, by the decree
of the judge of the eastern district of Florida. The decree was affirmed on appeal. The United States v. Fernandez, 10 Peters, 303.
The subject of grants of land within the Indian boundary, which had not by any official act been
declared a part of the royal domain, was fully and ably considered in the case of Johnson v. M'Intosh, 8 Wheat. 543 ; 5 Cond. Rep. 515. Every European government claimed and exercised the right of grant-
ing lands, while in the occupation of the Indians. Ibid. The grants of lands in the possession of the Indians by the governor of Florida, under the crown of
Spain, were good to pass the right of the crown. The grants severed them from the royal domain, so
that they became private property ; which was not ceded to the United States by the treaty with Spain.
Ibid. The Supreme Court cannot attach any condition to a grant of absolute property in the whole of the
land. This grant was made by the governor of East Florida in absolute property, with a promise of a
title in form. He was the exclusive judge of the copditions to be imposed on his grant, and of their performance. The United States v. Segui, 10 Peters, 306.
A grant of land by the governor of East Florida, in consideration of services to the Spanish government, made before the cession of the territory of Florida to the United States, confirmed. The United States v. Chaires, 10 Peters, 308.
Under a grant of the governor of Florida, prior to the cession of the same to the United States, of sixteen thousand acres of land, for the purpose of erecting a water-mill, a survey of five hundred and
twenty acres was made ; and at another place, a survey of fifteen thousand six hundred and thirty acres
was also made. The Supreme Court held, that the first survey of five hundred and twenty acres was valid, and that the survey of fifteen thousand four hundred and eighty acres was invalid ; but that the
grantee has a title to fifteen thousand four hundred and eighty acres of vacant land; which he has a
right to have surveyed, adjoining the survey of five hundred and twenty acres. The United States v. Seton, 10 Peters, 309.
Under a Spanish grant of five miles square, ten thousand acres were surveyed at one place, and six thousand acres were surveyed at another place, as the whole quantity of ungranted land could not be found together. The grant was confirmed. The United States v. Sibbald, 10 Peters, 313.
A grant of land was made by governor Coppinger, in June, 1828. The grant was made to the appel-
lee, on his stating his intention to build a saw-mill. The decree grants to the petitioner " license to construct a water-saw mill, on the creek known by the name of Pottsburg, bounded by the lands of
Strawberry Hill, and this tract not being sufficient, I grant him the equivalent quantity in Cedar Swamp about a mile east of M'Queen's mill, but with the precise condition that, as long as he does not erect said machinery, this grant will be considered null, and without value nor effect until that event takes

By the Court--The judge of the

superior court construed this concession to be a grant of land, and we concur with him. United States

.

A grant of land in East Florida was made by the governor, before the cession of Florida by Spain to

the United States, on conditions which were not performed by the grantee within the time limited in

the grant; or any exertions made by him to perform them. No sufficient cause for the non-performance

of the conditions having been shown, the decree of the Supreme Court of East Florida, which con-

firmed the grant, was reversed. United States v. Mills' Heirs, 12 Peters, 215. A grant for land in Florida by governor Coppinger, on condition that the grantee build a mill, with-
in a period fixed in the grant, was declared to be void ; the grantee not having performed the condition, or shown sufficient cause for its non-performance. United States v. Kingsley, 12 Peters, 476.
Under the Florida treaty, grants of land made before the 24th January, 1818, by his Catholic majesty, or by his lawful authorities, stand ratified and confirmed to the same extent that the same grants would be valid if Florida had remained under the dominion of Spain ; and the owners of conditional grants who have been prevented from fulfilling all the conditions of their grants, have time by the treaty ex-
tended to them to complete such conditions. That time as was declared by the Supreme Court in Arredondo's case, 6 Peters, 691, began to run in regard to individual rights, from the ratification of the treaty; and the treaty declares, if the conditions are not complied with, within the terms limited in the

grant, that the grants shall be null and void. Ibid. A grant by governor Coppinger of fourteen thousand five hundred acres of land, in Last Honda,
part of thirty thousand acres granted in consideration of services to the crown of Spain, and the offi-

cers of Spain, which had been surveyed by the appointed officer, confirmed. United States v. Levy,

12 .Peters 218. The court refused to allow a survey of land to be made to make up for a deficiency in the survey of
fourteen thousand five hundred acres, in consequence of part of the land included therein being covered

with water, and being marshes. Even if a survey had not been made under the concession, it would

not be competent for the superior court of East Florida, or for the Supreme Court, to designate a new location varying from the original concession, as any such variation would be equivalent to a new grant.

a" concession was made by the governor of Florida, before the cession of Florida to the United

States, on condition that the grantee should erect a water saw-mill, " and with the precise condition, that until he executes the said machinery, the grant to be considered void, and without effect, until that event takes place." The mill was never erected, and no sufficient reason shown tor its non-erection.
The court held that the concession gave no title to the land. United States v. Drummond, 13 Peters,

84. A grant of land in East Florida, by the Spanish governor, on the condition that a water saw-mill
should be erected on the land, declared void ; the condition of the grant not having been performed ac-

cording to the terms of the grant. United States v. Burgevin, 13 Peters, 85. . A grant by governor Coppinger of fourteen thousand five hundred acres of land, in East Flonda, part
of the thirty thousand acres, granted in consideration of services to the crown of Spain and the officers of

Spain, which had been surveyed by the appointed officer, confirmed, The United States v. Moses E.

Levy, 13 Peters, 81. The court refused to allow a survey of land to be made, to make up for a deficiency in the survey
of fourteen thousand five hundred acres, in consequence of part of the land included therein being
covered with water, and being marshes. Even if a survey had not been made under the concession, it would not be competent for the superior court of East Florida, or for the Supreme Court, to designate a new location varying from the original concession, as any such variation would be equivalent to a

new grant. Ibid.

O1,

A grant of land by Estrada, the governor of East Florida, was made on the 1st of August, 181b, to

Elizabeth Wiggins, on a petition, stating, that " owing to the diminution of trade, she will have to

devote herself to the pursuits of the country." The grant was made for the quantity of land appor-

tioned by the regulations of East Florida to the number of the family of the grantee. It was regu-

larly surveyed by the surveyor general, according to the petition and grant. No settlement or improve-

ment was ever made by the grantee, or by any one acting for her, on the property. In 1831, Elizabeth

Wiggins presented apetition to the superiorcourtof East Florida, praying for a confirmation ofthe grant;

and in July, 1838, the court gave a decree in favour of the claimant. On an appeal to the Supreme Court of

the United States, the decree of the superior court of East Florida was reversed. The court held, that

by the regulations established on the 25th November, 1818, by governor Coppinger, the grant had become

void, because of the non-improvement, and the neglect to settle the land granted. The United States

v. Elizabeth Wiggins, 14 Peters, 334. The existence of a foreign law, especially unwritten, is a fact to be proved like any other fact, by

appropriate evidence. Ibid.

A copy of the decree by the governor of East Florida, granting land to a petitioner while Spain had

possession of the territory, certified by the secretary of the government to have been faithfully made

from the original in the secretary's office, is evidence in the courts of the United States. By the laws

of Spain, prevailing in the province at that time, the secretary was the proper officer to give copies; and the law trusted him for this particular purpose, so far as he acted under its authority. The origi-

nal was confined to the public office. Ibid.

The eighth article of the Florida treaty stipulates, that "grants of land made by Spain, in Florida,

after the 24th of January, 1818, shall be ratified and confirmed to the persons in possession of the land,

to the same extent that the same grants would be valid, if the government of the territory had remained

under the dominion of Spain." The government of the United States may take advantage of the non-

performance of the conditions prescribed by the law relative to grants of land, if the treaty does not

provide for the omission. Ibid. In the cases of Arredondo, 6 Peters, 691, and Percheman, 7 Peters, 54, it was held, that the words in

the Florida treaty, " shall be ratified and confirmed ;" in reference to perfect titles, should be construed,

" are ratified and confirmed." The object of the court in these cases was to exempt them from the

operation of the eighth article, for that they were perfect titles by the laws of Spain, when the treaty

was made ; and that when the soil and sovereignty of Floridawere ceded by the second article, private

rights of property were, by implication, protected. By the law of nations, the rights to property are secured when territories are ceded; and to reconcile the eighth article of the treaty with the law of

nations, the Spanish side of the article was referred to in aid of the American side. The court held,

that perfect titles " stood confirmed" by the treaty; and must be so recognised by the United States,

in our courts. Ibid. Perfect titles to lands, made by Spain in the territory of Florida before the 24th January, 1818, were

intrinsically valid, and exempt from the provision of the eighth article of the treaty; and they need no

sanction from the legislative or judicial departments of the United States. Ibid.

The eighth article of the Florida treaty was intended to apply to claims to land whose validity

depended on the performance of conditions, in consideration of which the concessions had been made;

and which must have been performed before Spain was bound to perfect the titles. The United States

were bound after the cession of the country, to the same extent that Spain had been bound

before the ratification of the treaty, to perfect them by legislation and adjudication.^ Ibid.

A grant of land by the government of Florida, made before the cession of Florida to the United

States by Spain, confirmed : every point involved in the case having been conclusively settled by the

court in their former adjudications in similar cases. The United States v. Waterman, 14 Peters, 478.

The Supreme Court, in the case of the United States v. Clark, 8 Peters, 48, say " that if the validity

of the grant depends upon its being in conformity with the royal order of Spain of 1790, it cannot be

supported;" but immediately proceeds to show, " though the royal order is recited in the grant, that it

was, in fact, founded on the meritorious consideration of the petitioner having constructed a machine

of great value for sawing timber; the recital of the royal order of 1790, in this grant, is entirely im-

material, and does not affect the instrument." Held, the recital of the royal order, in this case, is quite

immaterial. Ibid. The case of the United States v. Wiggins, 14 Peters, 325, which decided that certain proof of the

certificate of Aguilar, secretary of East Florida, was sufficient, cited; and the decision on that point

affirmed. Ibid. The Spanish governors of Florida had, by the laws of the Indies, power to make large grants to the

subjects of the crown of Spain. The royal order of Spain of 1790, applied to grants to foreigners.

These grants, before the cession of Florida to the United States, had been sanctioned for many years

by the king of Spain, and the authorities representing him in Cuba, the Floridas, and Louisiana. This

authority has been frequently affirmed by the Supreme Court. Ibid. An application was made to the governor of Florida, in 1814, stating services performed by the peti-

tioner for the government of Spain, and the intention of the petitioner to invest his means in the erec-

tion of a water saw-mill, and marking the place where the lands were situated which were asked for.

The governor granted the land,referring to the merits and services of the applicant, and in considera-

tion of the advantages which would result to the home and foreign trade by the use proposed to be

made of the land. Held, that this was not a conditional grant; and that no evidence of the erection

of a water saw-mill was required to be given to maintain its validity, or induce its confirmation. Ibid.

John Forbes by memorial to governor Kindelan, the governor of East Florida, set forth, that in 1799,

there had been granted to Panton Leslie and company, for the purpose of pasturage, fifteen thousand

acres of land, which they were obliged to abandon, as being of inferior quality. Forbes, as the suc-

cessor to these grantees, asked to be permitted to abandon these fifteen thousand acres, and in lieu, to

have granted to him ten thousand acres, as an equivalent, on Nassau river. The petition avers that the

object was to establish a rice plantation. The petition was referred to the " Comptroller," who gave it

as his opinion that the culture of rice should be promoted. Governor Kindelan permitted the aban-

donment of the fifteen thousand acres granted before, and in lieu thereof, granted to John Forbes, for

the purpose of cultivating rice, ten thousand acres in the district, on banks of the river Nassau. Sur-

veys of seven thousand acres of land, at the head of the river " Little St. Mary" or " St. Mary," and

three thousand acres in " Cabbage Swamp," were made under this grant. No description of the

locality of the land other than that in the certificate of the survey was given ; nor do the surveys prove

that the land surveyed lay in the district of the river Nassau. No evidence was given of the situation

of " Cabbage Swamp." Held, that these surveys were not made of the land granted by governor Kin-

delan ; and according to the decisions of this court on all occasions, the surveys, to give them validity,

must be in conformity with the grants on which they are founded ; and to make them the origin of title,

they must be of the land described in the grant of the Spanish government. The United States v.

Forbes, 15 Peters, 173.

The courts of justice can only adjudge what had been granted ; and declare that the lands granted

by the lawful authorities of Spain, are separated from the public domain : but where the land is ex-

pressly granted at one place, they have no power, by a decree, to grant an equivalent at another place,

^ThedVireVVf the superior court of East Florida, by which a grant for fifty thousand acres of land,

made by governor White, the Spanish governor of East Florida, dated July 29, 1802, was rejected,
affirmed. Buyck v. The United States, 15 Peters, 215. The land had been granted by governor White, on a petition from the grantee stating his intention to
occupy and improve the same with Bengal negroes, and native citizens of the United States; and stating that other grants of the same lands had been made, on condition of settlement, which conditions had not been performed, and such grants were therefore void. The petitioner promised to make the settlement within an early period after the grant. The governor granted the land, referring to the petition, also, with the condition that the grantee should not cede any part of the land, without the consent of the government. No endorsement or settlement was at anytime made on the land by the grantee. Held, that the government of the United States were not bound under the Florida treaty, to confirm the

The description of the portion of the land asked for from the Spanish governor, " lands at Musquito to
fifty thousand acres, south and north of said place," is not sufficiently definite : and from such a description no exception could be made from the public lands acquired by the United States under the Florida treaty The regulations for granting lands in Florida by the Spanish authorities, required that grants should be made in a certain place : and there were no floating rights of survey out of the place designated in the grant; unless when the land granted could not be got there in its exact quantity, and an
equivalent was provided for. Ibid. The laws and ordinances of the government of Spam in relation to grants of land by the Spanish
government, must be of universal application in the construction of grants. It is essential to the validity of such grants, that the land granted shall be described so as to be capable of being distinguished from other things of the same kind, or capable of being ascertained by extraneous testimony. Ibid.
The certificate of Don Tomas de Aguilar, secretary of the government and province, of the copy ot the grant of the governor, stating the same " to be faithfully drawn from the original m the secretary's office under his charge," was legal evidence of the grant; and was properly admitted as such in sup-
port of the same. The United States v. Delespine, 15 Peters, 226. A grant of ten thousand two hundred and forty acres of land by the Spanish governor of Florida,
which recited among other things, that it was made under a royal order of the king of Spam, of 29th March 1815, and which was not in conformity with the grant, but which was made in the exercise of other powers to grant lands which had been vested in the governor, was not made invalid by the recital of the royal order as the authority for the grant. The grant recited also, that it was made in consideration of military services, and was also in consideration of the surrender of another grant previously made, which surrender had been accepted by the governor. These were sufficient inducements to the

A claim^or land in East Florida, granted by governor White to Daniel O'Hara, rejected by the superior

court of East Florida, and the decree of that court affirmed. O'Hara v. The United States, 15 Peters, 275.
Governor White, on the petition of Daniel O'Hara, soliciting a grant of fifteen thousand acres, made a decree granting " the lands solicited," " at the place indicated," " in conformity with the number of
workers which he may have to cultivate them, the corresponding number of acres may be surveyed to him " " and that he will take possession of the said lands in six months from the date of said grant." Held, that thisis a decree not granting fifteen thousand acres as asked for ; but so much of the place where it is asked for as shall be surveyed in conformity with the number of workers the grantee may have to cultivate the land ; the quantity could be determined by the regulation of the governor, made the month after the grant, and determining the quantity of land to be surveyed according to the number of per-
sons in the family of the grantee, slaves included. That the grant was made before the date of the

regulation, makes no difference. Ibid.

n,

,

No settlement was made on the lands claimed under the grant. The building of a house on the land

is but evidence of an intention to make a settlement, but was not a settlement; which required the re-

moval of persons or workers to the land, and cultivating it. Ibid.

,

No claim for the land can be sustained under a grant, or confirmation of a prior grant, made by a

decree of governor Coppinger in 1819, as the same was substantially a violation of the treaty with Spain, which confirms only grants made before the 24th January, 1818. The prior grant to O'Hara having

become void by the non-performance of the conditions annexed to ft, the decree of governor Coppinger,

in 1819, was an attempt to make a new grant. Ibid.

m

If the grant were not void from the non-performance of the conditions of settlement annexed to

it, the omission to have the land surveyed, and returned to the proper office, would make it void,

unless the grantee had made a settlement; in which event, a survey would be Plumed. The grant

was made in the " district of Nassau," &c. This was an indefinite description of the land, as was held

in Buyck v. The United States, decided at this term. Ibid. A concession of lands, by the council at St. Augustine, was not authorized by the laws of Spain,
relative to the granting and confirming land titles. The United States v. Delespine, 15 Peters. 319.

When a grant of land is indefinite as to its location, or so uncertain as to the place where the lands granted are intended to be surveyed, as to make it impossible to make a survey under the terms of the

grant with certainty, the grant will not be confirmed. Ibid.

and translate all papers that may be required of him by the commission-
ers." Sec . 3. And be it further enacted, That said commissioners, pre-
viously to entering on a discharge of the duties assigned them, shall,
the commissioners, or to the register and receiver of East Florida, and had not been " finally acted upon," should be adjudicated and settled, as prescribed by the act of 1828. There was no direct limi-
tation as to the time in which a claim should be presented. Ibid. When a petition for the confirmation of a claim to lands in Florida was presented, and was defective,
and the court allowed an amended petition to be filed, it would be too strict to say the original petition was not the commencement of the proceeding, but that the amendment allowed by the superior court should be taken as the date when the claim was first preferred. Ibid.
When certain testimonials of title under a Spanish grant had beenadmitted, without exception, before the commissioners of the United States for the adjustment of claims to lands in Florida, and before the superior court in Middle Florida, without objection as to the mode and form of their proof; the Supreme Court, on an appeal, will not interfere with the question as to the sufficiency of the proof, or the authenticity of the act, relating to the title which had been admitted by the authorities in Florida, which was
the tribunal to judge of the evidence. Ibid. Breward petitioned the governor of East Florida, intending to establish a saw-mill to saw timber in St.
John's river, for a grant of five miles square of land, or its equivalent; ten thousand acres to be in the neighbourhood of the place designated, and the remaining six thousand acres in Cedar Swamp, on the west side of St. John's river, and in Cabbage Hammock on the east side of the river. The governor granted the land asked for, on the condition that the mill should be built; and the condition was complied with. On the 27th of May, 1817, the surveyor general surveyed seven thousand acres under the grant, including Little Cedar Creek, and bounded on three sides by Big Cedar Creek, including the mill. This grant and survey were confirmed. The United States v. Breward, 16 Peters, 143.
Three thousand acres were laid off on the northern part of the river St. John's, and east of the royal road, leading from the river to St. Mary's, four or five miles from the first survey. This survey having been made at a place not within the grant, was void : but the court held that the grantee is to be allowed to survey under the grant, three thousand acres adjoining the survey of seven thousand acres, if so much vacant land can be found ; and patents for the same shall issue for the land, if laid out in confor-
mity with the decree of the court in this case. Ibid. In 1819, two thousand acres were surveyed in Cedar Swamp, west of the river St. John's, at a place
known by the name of Sugartown. This survey was confirmed. Ibid. Four thousand acres, by survey, dated April, 1819, in Cabbage Hammock, were laid out by the sur-
veyor general. This survey was confirmed. Ibid. By the eighth article of the Florida treaty, all grants of lands made before the 24th of January, 1824,
by his Catholic majesty, were confirmed ; but all grants made since the time when the first proposal by his majesty for the cession of the country was made, are declared and agreed by the treaty to be void. The survey of five thousand acres having been made at a different place from the land granted, would if confirmed be a new appropriation of so much land, and void if it had been ordered by the governor of Florida; and of course it is void, having nothing to uphold it but the act of the surveyor general.

In the superior court of East Florida, the counsel for the claimant offered to introduce testimony in

regard to the survey of three thousand acres; and the counsel of the United States withdrew his

objection to the testimony. The admission of the evidence did not prove the survey to have been

made. Proof of the signature of the surveyor general to the return of survey made the survey prima

facie evidence. Ibid. The proof of the signature of Aguilar to the certificate of a copy of the grant by the governor of

East Florida, authorizes its admission in evidence ; but this does not establish the validity of the con-

cession. To test the validity of the survey, it was necessary to give it in evidence; but the survey did

not give a good title to the land. Ibid. The United States have a right to disprove a survey made by the surveyor general, if the survey on

the ground does not correspond to the land granted. Ibid. On a petition from Pedro Miranda, stating services performed by him for Spain, governor White, the

governor of East Florida, on the 26th November, 1810, made a grant to him of eight leagues square,

or three hundred and sixty-eight thousand six hundred and forty acres of land on the waters of Hillsbo-

rough and Tampa Bay-, in the eastern district of Florida. No survey was made under this grant while

Florida remained a province of Spain, nor was any attempt made to occupy or survey the land, until

after the cession of Florida to the United States. In 1821, it was alleged that a survey was made by a

surveyor of East Florida. Held, that the grant was void ; no land having been severed from the public

domain previous to the 24th January, 1818, and because the calls of the grant are too indefinite for

locality to be given to them. The United States v. Miranda, 16 Peters, 153. The settled doctrine of the Supreme Court, in respect to Florida grants, is, that grants embracing a

wide extent of country, or with a large area of natural or artificial boundaries, and which granted

lands were not surveyed before the 24th of January, 1818, and which are without such designation as

will give a place of beginning for a survey, are not lands withdrawn from the maps of vacant lands,

ceded to the United States in Florida, and are void; as well on that account as for being so uncertain

that locality cannot be given to them. Ibid. On the 6th of April, 1816, a grant was made by the governor of Florida, of five miles square, or

sixteen thousand acres of land, on condition that a mill should be built. The grant of six thousand

acres was for land on Doctor's branch, where the mill was intended to be erected. The ten thousand

acres were granted on the north-east side on the lagoon and of India river. The six thousand acres were

surveyed in 1819, on Doctor's branch, and the mill was built. The survey under this grant was confirmed.

The United States v. Low et al. 162.

,

According to the strict ideas of conforming a survey to a location, in the United States, the survey

of ten thousand acres should be located adjoining the natural object called for, there being no other to

aid and control the general call; and therefore, the head of the lagoon would necessarily have formed one boundary. But it is obvious, more latitude was allowed in the province of Florida, under the government of Spain. The surveyor general having returned that the survey was made according to
the grant, and in the absence of other contradictory proof, the claim was confirmed. Ibid. A grant of five miles square, or sixteen thousand acres of land, was made by the Spanish governor of
East Florida, at the mouth of the river Santa Lucia. The petition for the grant stated various merits and losses of the petitioner, and asked the grant of five miles square, for the construction of a water saw-mill. The grant was given for the purpose mentioned, "and also paying attention to the services and other matters set forth in the petition." No survey under the grant was made by the surveyor gen-
eral of Florida; but a survey was made by a private surveyor. The survey did not follow the calls of the grant, and no proof was given that it was made at the place mentioned in the grant. The survey and plat were not made according to the established rules relative to surveys to be inade by the surveyor
general under such grants. Nor was the plat made with the proportion of land on the river required by the regulations. The superior court of Florida held that the grant having been made in consideration of services rendered by the grantee, as well as for a water saw-mill, it was valid without the
erection of the mill; but the survey was altogether void, and of no effect. The decree of the superior court of Florida, by which the grant and survey were confirmed, was remanded to the superior court of Florida; that court to order the sixteen thousand acres granted, to be surveyed according to the principles stated in the opinion of the Supreme Court. It has often been held that the authorities of
Spain had the power to grant the public domain in accordance with their own ideas of the merits and considerations presented by the grantee; and that the powers of the Supreme Court of the United States extend only to the inquiry, whether, in fact, the grant had been made, and its legal effect when made, in cases where the law by implication introduced a condition, or it was peculiar in its provisions. No special ordinance of Spain introduces conditions into mill grants. The United States v. Hanson, 16
Peters, 196. The certificate of a private surveyor, that he had permission from the governor of the territory to
make a survey of the land granted, is no evidence of the fact. There is a marked and wide difference in the effect of the certificate of the surveyor general and of a private individual, who assumes to cer-
tify without authority. Ibid. A grant by a Spanish governor of Florida meant not, as in the states of the United States, a perfect
title ; but an incipient right, which,when surveyed, required confirmation by the governor. The duty of confirmation by the acts of Congress is deputed to the courts of justice of the United States, in
execution of the treaty with Spain. Ibid. The same credence that was accorded to the return of the surveyor general by the Spanish govern-
ment, is due to it by the courts of the United States. Plats and certificates, because of the official character of the surveyor general, have accorded to them the force and character of a deposition. Ibid.
A grant of fifteen thousand acres by the Spanish governor of East Florida, in consideration of important services performed in behalf of the government of Spain, to George Atkinson, confirmed by
the Supreme Court. By the eighth article of the Florida treaty, no grants of land made after the 24th of January, 1818, were valid; nor could a survey be valid on lands other than those authorized by the grant. Still the power to survey in conformity to the concessions existed up to the change of flags.
The United States v. Clarke, 16 Peters, 228. Spain had the power to make grants founded on any consideration and subject to any restrictions
within her dominions. If a grant was binding on that government, it is so on the United States, the
successor of Spain. All the grants of land made by the lawful authorities of the king of Spain, before the 24th of January, 1818, were by the treaty ratified and confirmed to the owners of the lands.
Ibid. The grant to Atkinson was for the land he mentioned in his petition, or for any other lands that were
vacant. Three surveys were made of the lands within the quantity granted, not at the place specially
mentioned in the grant, but at other places. Held, that these surveys were valid, notwithstanding that
they were made at different places. Ibid. A claim for eight thousand acres of land in East Florida, founded on a petition of Domingo Acosta to
governor Coppinger, made on the 20th of May, 1816. The petition stated that services had been performed by the claimant for the defence, support and advancement of the town of Fernandina, which had never been rewarded. Governor Coppinger gave a decree in favour of the petitioner, " it being the will of the sovereign that the merits of his subjects should be rewarded." The originals of the petition and decree were not produced, they having been lost; but a certificate signed by Don Thomas Aguilar, the secretary of the government, was exhibited, which stated that the copies of the petition and decree, which were given in evidence, had been faithfully drawn from the originals in his office. Four plats and certificates of survey, made by Clarke, surveyor of the province; two of which surveys were made before the 24th January, 1818, and one on the 14th February, 1818; another on the 20th January, 1820; were given in evidence without objection, in the court below, to show the location of the land claimed. The decree of the superior court of Florida, in favour of the claimant, was affirmed.
The United States v. Acosta, 17 Peters, 16. The official certificates of the secretary of the government of Florida, during the dominion of Spain
over the territory, after evidence that no originals could be found in the proper office, was sufficient evidence of the copies of the petition and decree of the governor; no proof having been given to con-
tradict or impair the force of the same. Ibid. The governor of the territory of Florida, as the deputy of the king of Spain, was the sole judge of
the merits on which the claim stated in the petition was founded ; and he had undoubted power to
reward the merits of the grantee. This has been so decided in many cases. Ibid. Although in the governor's decree, there may be no description of any place where the land granted

representatives of such persons, claiming title to lands under any patent, grant, concession, or order of survey, dated previous to the twentyfourth day of January, one thousand eight hundred and eighteen, which were valid under the Spanish government, or by the law of nations, and which are not rejected by the treaty ceding the territory of East and West Florida to the United States, shall file, before the commissioners, his, her, or their, claim, setting forth, particularly, its situation and boundaries, if to be ascertained, with the deraignment of title, where they
are not the grantees, or original claimants; which shall be recorded by the secretary, and who, for his services, shall be entitled to demand from the claimants ten cents for each hundred words contained in said papers so recorded; he shall be also entitled to twenty-five cents for each subpoena issued: Provided, That if the amount so received shall exceed one thousand two hundred and fifty dollars, which is hereby declared the compensation for his services, the excess shall be reported to the commissioners, and be subject to their disposition; and said commissioners shall proceed to examine and determine on the validity of said patents,
grants, concessions, and orders of survey, agreeably to the laws and ordinances heretofore existing of the governments making the grants, respectively, having due regard, in all Spanish claims, to the conditions and stipulations contained in the eighth article of a treaty concluded at Washington, between his Catholic majesty, andthe United States,on the twenty-second of February, one thousand eight hundred and nineteen ; but any claim not filed previous to the thirty-first day of May, one thousand eight hundred and twenty-three, shall be deemed and held to be void and of none effect: Provided, nevertheless, and be it further enacted, That in all claims submitted to the decision of the commissioners, where the same land, or any part thereof, is claimed by titles emanating
both from the British and Spanish governments, the commissioners shall not decide the same, but shall report all such cases, with an abstract of the evidence, to the Secretary of the Treasury.

And be it further enacted, That the commissioners shall have power to inquire into the justice and validity of the claims filed with them; and shall be, and are hereby, authorized to administer oaths, to compel the attendance of witnesses by subpoenas issued by the Secretary, and the adduction of such testimony as may be wanted; they shall have access to all papers and records of a public nature relative to any land titles within said provinces, and to make transcripts thereof.

The undersigned Commissioners, appointed, sworn, and authorized, in virtue of the 6th article of the treaty of peace and amity between his Britannic Majesty and the United States of America, concluded at Ghent, on the 24th of December, 1814, impartially to examine, and, by a report or declaration, under their hands and seals, to designate " that portion of the boundary of the United States from the point where the 45th degree of north latitude strikes the river Iroquois, or Cataraqui, along the middle of said river into Lake Ontario, through the middle of said lake until it strikes the communication, by water, between that lake and Lake Erie; thence, along the middle of said communication, into Lake Erie, through the middle of said lake, until it arrives at the water communication into Lake Huron; thence, through the middle of said water communication, into Lake Huron; thence, through the middle of said lake, to the water communication between that lake and Lake Superior;" and to " decide to which of the two contracting parties the several islands, lying within the said rivers, lakes, and water communications, do respectively belong, in conformity with the true intent of the treaty of 1783;" do decide and declare, that the following described line, (which is more clearly indicated on a series of maps accompanying this report, exhibiting correct surveys and delineations of all the rivers, lakes, water communications, and islands, embraced by the 6th article of the treaty of Ghent, by a black line shaded on the British side with red, and on the American side with blue; and each sheet of which series of maps is identified by a certificate, subscribed by the Commissioners, and by the two principal surveyors employed by them,) is the true boundary intended by the two before-mentioned treaties ; that is to say :
Beginning at a stone monument, erected by Andrew Ellicot, Esquire, in the year 1817, on the south bank, or shore, of the said river Iroquois, or Cataraqui, (now called the St. Lawrence,) which monument bears south 74° 45' west, and is eighteen hundred and forty yards distant from the stone church in the Indian village of St. Regis, and indicates the point at which the 45th parallel of north latitude strikes the said river; thence, running north 35° 45' west, into the river, on a line at right angles with the southern shore, to a point one hundred yards south of the opposite island, called Cornwall island; thence, turning westerly, and passing around the southern and western sides of said island, keeping one hundred yards distant therefrom, and following the curvatures of its shores, to a point opposite to the north-west corner, or angle, of said island; thence, to and along the middle of the main river, until it approaches the eastern extremity of Barnhart's island ; thence, northerly, along the channel which divides the last-mentioned island from the

Count Nesselrode to Mr. Middleton.
The undersigned Secretary of State, directing the Imperial administration of Foreign Affairs, has the honor to communicate to Mr. Middleton, Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States of America, the opinion which the Emperor, his master, has thought it his duty to express upon the object of the differences which have arisen between the United States and Great Britain, relative to the interpretation of the first article of the Treaty of Ghent.
Mr. Middleton is requested to consider this opinion as the award required of the Emperor by the two powers.
He will doubtless recollect, that he, as well as the Plenipotentiary of His Britannic Majesty, in all his memorials, has principally insisted on the grammatical sense of the first article of the Treaty of Ghent, and that, even in his note of the 4th [16th] November, 1821, he has formally declared, that it was on the signification of the words in the text of the article as it now is, that the decision of His Imperial Majesty
should be founded. The same declaration being made in the note of the British Plenipo-
tentiary, dated Sth [20th] October, 1821, the Emperor had only to conform to the wishes expressed by the two parties, by devoting all his attention to the examination of the grammatical question.
The above mentioned opinion will show the manner in which His Imperial Majesty judges of this question: and in order that the cabinet of Washington may also know the motives upon which the Emperor's judgment is founded, the undersigned has hereto subjoined an extract of some observations upon the literal sense of the first article of the
Treaty of Ghent. In this respect, the Emperor has confined himself to following the
rules of the language employed in drawing up the act, by which the two powers have required his arbitration, and defined the object of their
difference. His Imperial Majesty has thought it his duty, exclusively, to obey the
authority of these rules, and his opinion could not but be the rigorous and necessary consequence thereof.
The undersigned eagerly embraces this occasion to renew to Mr. Middleton the assurances of his most distinguished consideration.

Monsieur de Middleton est invite a considerer cette opinion comme la decision arbitrale demandee a I'Empereur par les deux Puissances.
Il se rappellera sans doute, qu'aussi bien que le Plenipotentiaire de S. M. Britannique, il a dans tous ses memoires principalement insiste sur le sens grammatical de 1'Art. I. du Traite de Gand, & que meme dans sa note du yL.

TREATY WITH GREAT BRITAIN. 1822.

April 22, 1822.

HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY'S AWARD.
Inv it ed by the United States of America and by Great Britain to give an opinion, as arbitrator in the differences which have arisen between these two powers, on the subject of the interpretation of the first article of the Treaty which they concluded at Ghent, on the 24th December, 1814, the Emperor has taken cognizance of all the acts, memorials, and notes, in which the respective plenipotentiaries have set forth to his administration of foreign affairs the arguments upon which each of the litigant parties depends in support of the interpretation given by it to the said article.
After having maturely weighed the observations exhibited on both sides:
Considering that the American plenipotentiary and the plenipotentiary of Britain have desired that the discussion should be closed;
Considering that the former, in his note of the 4th (16th) November, 1821, and the latter, in his note of the Sth (20th) October, of the same year, have declared that it is upon the construction of the text of the article as it stands, that the arbitrator's decision should be founded, and that both have appealed, only as subsidiary means, to the general principles of the law of nations and of maritime law;
The Emperor is of opinion " that the question can only be decided according to the literal and grammatical sense of the first article of the treaty of Ghent."
As to the literal and grammatical sense of the first article of the treaty of Ghent:
Considering that the period upon the signification of which doubts have arisen, is expressed as follows:
" All territory, places, and possessions, whatsoever, taken by either party from the other during the war, or which may be taken after the signing of this treaty, excepting only the islands hereinafter mentioned, shall be restored without delay, and without causing any destruction or carrying away any of the artillery or other public property originally
captured in the said forts or places, and which shall remain therein
upon the exchange of the ratifications of this treaty, or any slaves, or other private property; and all archives, records, deeds, and papers, either of a public nature, or belonging to private persons, which, in the course of the war, may have fallen into the hands of the officers of either party, shall be, as far as may be practicable, forthwith restored and delivered to the proper authorities and persons to whom they respectively belong."
Considering that, in this period, the words originally captured, and which shall remain therein upon the exchange of the ratifications, form an incidental phrase, which can have respect, grammatically, only to the substantives or subjects which precede;
That the first article of the treaty of Ghent thus prohibits the contracting parties from carrying away from the places of which it stipulates the restitution, only the public property, which might have been
originally captured there, and which should remain therein upon the ex-
change of the ratifications, but that it prohibits the carrying away from these same places, any private property whatever ;
That, on the other hand, these two prohibitions are solely applicable to the places of which the article stipulates the restitution :
The Emperor is of opinion : " That the United States of America are entitled to a just indemnifi-

Inv ite par les Etats-Unis d'Amerique et par la Grande Bretagne a emettre une opinion, comme arbitre dans les differends qui se sont eleves entre ces deux Puissances, au sujet de 1'interpretation de Particle premier du Traite qu'elles ont conclu a Gand, le 24 Decembre, 1814, PEmpereur a pris connoissance de tous les actes, memoires et notes, ou les Plenipotentiaires respectifs ont expose a Son Ministere des affaires etrangeres, les argumens que chacune des parties en litige fait valoir a 1'appui de Pinterpretation qu'elle donne au dit article.
Apres avoir inurement pese les observations developpees de part et d'autre:
Considerant que le Plenipotentiaire Americain et le Plenipotentiaire Britannique ont demande que la discussion fut close;
Considerant que le premier dans sa note du 4/16 Novembre, 1821, et le second dans sa note du 8/20Octobre de la meme annee, ont declare, que c'est sur la construction du texte de I'article, tel qu'il existe, que la decision arbitrale doit se fonder, et que Pun et P autre n'ont invoque que comme moyens subsidiaires, les principes generaux de droit des gens et de droit maritime.
L'Empereur est d'avis, "que ce n'est que d'apres le sens litteral et grammatical de Particle 1, du traite de Gand, que la question peut etre decidee."
Quant au sens litteral et grammatical de Particle 1, du traite de Gand.
Considerant que la periode sur la signification de la quelle il s'eleve des doutes, est construite ainsi qu'il suit.
" Tous les territoires, lieux et possessions quelconques, pris par Pune des parties sur Pautre, durant la guerre, ou qui pourroient etre pris apres la signature du present traite, a Pexception seulement des isles ci-dessous mentionnees, seront rendus sans delai et sans faire detruire ou emporter aucune partie de Partillerie ou autre propriete publique originairement prise dans les dits forts et lieux et qui s'y trouvera au moment de Vechange des ratifications du traite ou aucuns esclaves ou autres proprietes privees. Et tous archives, registres, actes et papiers, soit d'une nature publique ou appartenans a des particuliers, qui dans le cours de la guerre peuvent etre tombes entre les mains des officiers de Pune ou de Pautre partie, seront de suite, en tant qu'il serapraticable, restitues et delivres aux autorites propres et personnes auxquelles ils appartiennent respectivement."
Considerant que dans cette periode, les mots: originairement prise et qui s'y trouvera au moment de I'echange des ratifications, forment une phrase incidente, laquelle ne peut se rapporter grammaticalement qu'aux substantifs ou sujets qui precedent.
Qu'ainsi Particle 1 du traite de Gand, ne defend aux parties contractantes d'emporter des lieux dont il stipule la restitution, que les seules proprietes publiques qui y auroient ete originairement prises et qui s'y trouveroient au moment de I'echange des ratifications, mais qu'il defend d'emporter de ces memes lieux, aucune propriete particuliere quelconque.
Que d'un autre cote, ces deux defenses ne sont applicables qu'uniquement aux lieux dont Particle stipule la restitution.
L'Empereur est d'avis: " Que les Etats-Unis d'Amerique, sont en droit de reclamer de la

The undersigned Secretary of State, directing the Imperial administration of foreign affairs, has, without delay, laid before the Emperor, his master, the explanations into which the Ambassador of His Britannic Majesty has entered with the Imperial Ministry, in consequence of the preceding confidential communication which was made to Mr. Middleton, as well as to Sir Charles Bagot, of the opinion expressed by the Emperor upon the true sense of the 1st Article of the Treaty of Ghent.
Sir Charles Bagot understands, that, in virtue of the decision of His Imperial Majesty, " His Britannic Majesty is not bound to indemnify the United States for any slaves, who, coming from places which have never been occupied by his troops, voluntarily joined the British forces, either in consequence of the encouragement which His Majesty's officers had offered them, or to free themselves from the power of their master--these slaves not having been carried away from places or territories captured by His Britannic Majesty during the war, and, consequently, not having been carried away from places of which the article stipulates the restitution."
In answer to this observation, the undersigned is charged by His Imperial Majesty to communicate what follows to the Minister of the United States of America.
The Emperor having, by the mutual consent of the two Plenipotentiaries, given an opinion, founded solely upon the sense which results from the text of the article in dispute, does not think himself called upon to decide here any question relative to what the laws of war permit or forbid to the belligerents; but, always faithful to the grammatical interpretation of the 1st Article of the Treaty of Ghent, His Imperial Majesty declares, a second time, that it appears to him according to this interpretation;
" That, in quitting the places and territories of which the Treaty of Ghent stipulates the restitution to the United States, his Britannic Majesty's forces had no right to carry away from these same places and territories, absolutely, any slave, by whatever means he had fallen or come into their power.

Le Soussigne, Secretaire d'Etat dirigeant le Ministere Imperial des affaires etrangeres, s'est empresse de porter a la connoissance de PEmpereur son maitre, les explications dans lesquelles Mr. 1'Ambassadeur de S. M. Britannique est entre avec le Ministere Imperial, a la suite de la communication prealable et confidentielle qui a ete faite a Monsieur de Middleton ainsi qu' a Mr. le Chevalier Bagot de I'opinion exprimee par 1'Empereur, sur le vrai sens de Part, ler du Traite de Gand.
Mr. le Chevalier Bagot entend qu'en vertu de la decision de Sa Majeste Imperiale, " S. M. Britannique n'est pas tenue a indemniser les Etats Unis d'aucuns esclaves qui, venant des endroits qui n'ont jamais ete occupes par ses troupes, se sont volontairement reunis aux forces Britanniques, ou en consequence de Pencouragement que les officiers de S. M. leur avoit offert, ou se derober au pouvoir de leur maitre, ces esclaves n'ayant pas ete emmenes des lieux ou territoires pris par S. M. Britannique durant le guerre, et consequemment n'ayant pas ete emmenes des lieux dont Particle stipule la restitution."
En reponse a cette observation, le soussigne est charge par Sa Majeste Imperiale, de communiquer ce qui suit a Monsieur le ministre des Etats Unis d'Amerique.
L'Empereur ayant, du consentement mutuel des deux plenipotentiaires, emis une opinion fondee uniquement sur le sens qui resulte du texte de I'article en litige, ne se croit appele a decider ici aucune question relative a ce que les loix de la guerre permettent ou defendent aux parties belligerantes, mais toujours fidele a Pinterpretation grammaticale de Part. lerdu traite de Gand, Sa Majeste Imperiale declare une seconde fois qu'il lui semble, d'apres cette interpretation.
" Qu'en quittant les lieux et territoires dont le traite de Gand stipule la restitution aux Etats Unis, les forces de S. M. Britannique n'avoient le droit d'emmener de ces memes lieux et territoires, absolument aucun esclave, par quelque moyen qu'il fut tombe ou venu se remettre en leur pouvoir.

" But that if, during the war, American slaves had been carried away by the English forces, from other places than those of which the Treaty of Ghent stipulates the restitution, upon the territory, or on board British vessels, Great Britain should not be bound to indemnify the United States for the loss of these slaves, by whatever means they might have fallen or come into the power of her officers."
Although convinced, by the previous explanations above mentioned, that such is also the sense which Sir Charles Bagot attaches to his observation, the undersigned has nevertheless received from His Imperial
Majesty orders to address the present note to the respective Plenipotentiaries, which will prove to them, that, in order the better to justify the confidence of the two Governments, the Emperor has been unwilling that the slightest doubt should arise regarding the consequences of his opinion.
The undersigned eagerly embraces this occasion of repeating to Mr. Middleton the assurance of his most distinguished consideration.

And his said Imperial Majesty having, after due consideration, given his decision upon these differences in the following terms, to wit: " That the United States of America are entitled to claim from Great Britain a just indemnification for all private property, which the British forces may have carried away; and as the question relates to slaves more especially, for all the slaves that the British forces may have carried away from places and territories of which the Treaty stipulates the restitution, in quitting these same places and territories. " That th§ United States are entitled to consider as having been so carried away, all such slaves as may have been transferred from the above-mentioned territories to British vessels within the waters of the said territories, and who for this reason may not have been restored. " But that if there should be any American slaves who were carried away from territories of which the first article of the Treaty of Ghent has not stipulated the restitution to the United States, the United States are not entitled to claim an indemnification for the said slaves." Now for the purpose of carrying into effect this award of His Imperial Majesty, as arbitrator, his good offices have been farther invoked to assist in framing such Convention or Articles of Agreement between the United States of America and His Britannic Majesty, as shall provide the mode of ascertaining and determining the value of slaves and of other private property, which may have been carried away in contra-

TRAITE A GRANDE BRETAGNE.
Au nom de la tres-sainte & indivisible Trinite : Ln President des Etats-Unis d'Amerique, & Sa Majeste le Roi du Royaume uni de la Grande Bretagne & de Flrlande, ayant decide d'un commun accord, en consequence de Farticle V. de la Convention conclue a Londres le 20 Octobre, 1818, que les differends qui se sont eleves entre les deux gouvernemens sur la construction & le vrai sens du 1 r article du Traite de paix & d'amitie, conclu a Gand le 24 Decembre, 1814, seraient deferes a Farbitrage amical de Sa Majeste FEmpereur de toutes les Russies; s'etant en outre engages reciproquement a regarder sa decision comme finale & definitive; & Sa Majeste Imperiale apres mure consideration, ayant emis cette decision dans les termes suivans. " Que les Etats-Unis d'Amerique sont en droit de reclamer de la Grand Bretagne une juste indemnite pour toutes les proprietes particulieres que les forces Britanniques auroient emportees; & comme il s'agit plus specialement d'esclaves, pour tous les esclaves que les forces Britanniques auroient emmenes des lieux & territoires dont le traite stipule la restitution, en quittant ces memes lieux & territoires. " Que les Etats-Unis sont en droit de regarder comme emmenes tous ceux de ces esclaves qui, des territoires indiques cidessus auroient ete transports a bord de vaisseaux Britanniques mouilles dans les eaux des dits territoires, & qui par ce motif n'auroient pas ete restitues. " Mais que s'il y a des esclaves Americains emmenes de territoires dont Farticle 1 r du traite de Gand n'a pas stipule la restitution aux Etats-Unis, les Etats-Unis ne sont pas en droit de reclamer une indemnite pour les dits esclaves." Comme il s'agit a present de mettre cette sentence arbitrale a execution, les bons offices de Sa Majeste Imperiale ont ete encore invoques, afin qu'une convention arretee entre les Etats Unis & Sa Majeste Britannique stipulat les articles d'un accord propre a etablir d'une part, le mode a suivre pour fixer & determiner la valeur des esclaves ou autres proprietes privees qui auroient ete emmenes en contravention au Traite

Vacancies to be filled up in the manner of the original appointment.

tion concluded at St. Petersburg on the day of ~ one thousand eight
hundred and twenty-two, between his Majesty the Emperor of all the Russias, the United States of America, and his Britannic Majesty, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will diligently, impartially, and carefully, examine, and, to the best of my judgment, according to justice and equity, decide all matters submitted to me as commissioner (or arbitrator, as the case may be,) under the said convention."
All vacancies occurring by death or otherwise shall be filled up in the manner of the original appointment, and the new commissioners or arbitrators shall take the same oath or affirmation, and perform the same duties.

If an average value be not agreed upon as compensation, the commissioners and arbitrators' shall fix an average value. In case they do not agree, the evidence, &c. shall be submitted to the minister of the mediating power. &c.

ARTICLE II.
If, at the first meeting of this board, the governments of the United States and of Great Britain shall not have agreed upon an average value, to be allowed as compensation for each slave for whom indemnification may be due; then, and in that case, the commissioners and arbitrators shall conjointly proceed to examine the testimony which shall be produced under the authority of the President of the United States, together with such other competent testimony as they may see cause to require or allow, going to prove the true value of slaves at the period of the exchange of the ratifications of the treaty of Ghent; and upon the evidence so obtained, they shall agree upon and fix the average value. But in case that a majority of the board of commissioners and arbitrators should not be able to agree respecting such average value, then and in that case, recourse shall be had to the arbitration of the minister or other agent of the mediating power, accredited to the government of the United States. A statement of the evidence produced, and of the proceedings of the board thereupon, shall be communicated to the said minister or agent, and his decision, founded upon such evidence and proceedings, shall be final and conclusive. And the said average value, when fixed and determined by either of the three before mentioned methods, shall in all cases serve as a rule for the compensation to be awarded for each and every slave, for whom it may afterwards be found that indemnification is due.

The two commissioners to constitute a board for the examination of claims.
His Britannic Majesty to cause evidence of the number of slaves carried away to be produced. The two commissioners to examine and determine claims, how.

ARTICLE III.
When the average value of slaves shall have been ascertained and fixed, the two commissioners shall constitute a board for the examination of the claims which are to be submitted to them, and they shall notify to the Secretary of State of the United States, that they are ready to receive a definite list of the slaves and other private property, for which the citizens of the United States claim indemnification; it being understood and hereby agreed that the commission shall not take cognizance of, nor receive, and that his Britannic majesty shall not be required to make, compensation for any claims for private property under the first article of the treaty of Ghent, not contained in the said list. And his Britannic majesty hereby engages to cause to be produced before the commission, as material towards ascertaining facts, all the evidence of which his majesty's government may be in possession, by returns from his majesty's officers or otherwise, of the number of slaves carried away. But the evidence so produced, or its defectiveness, shall not go in bar of any claim or claims which shall be otherwise satisfactorily authenticated.

Les vacances causees par la mort ou autrement, seront remplies de la merne maniere qu'au moment de la nomination primitive, & les nouveaux commissaires ou arbitres devront preter le meme serment ou affirmation, & s'acquitter des memes devoirs.
ARTICLE II. Si lors de la premiere reunion de ce conseil, le gouvernement des Etats Unis & celui de la Grande Bretagne ne sont point parvenus a determiner d'un commun accord la valeur moyenne qui devra etre assignee comme compensation pour chaque esclave, pour lequel il sera du une indemnite, dans ce cas les commissaires et les arbitres procederont conjointement a 1'examen de tous les temoignages qui leur seront presentes par ordre du President des Etats-Unis, ainsi que de tous les autres temoignages valables qu'ils croiront devoir requerir ou admettre dans la vue d'arreter la veritable valeur des esclaves a 1'epoque de 1'echange des ratifications du traite de Gand; & d'apres les preuves qu'ils auront ainsi obtenues, ils etabliront & fixeront la susdite valeur moyenne. Dans le cas ou la majorite du conseil des commissaires & arbitres ne pourroit pas s'accorder sur cette valeur proportionnelle, alors on aura recours a 1'arbitrage du ministre ou autre agent de la puissance mediatrice accredite aupres du gouvernement des Etats-Unis. Toutes les preuves produites & tous les actes des operations du conseil a ce sujet, lui seront communiques & la decision de ce ministre ou agent, basee, comme il vient d'etre dit, sur ces preuves & sur les actes de ces operations, sera regardee comme finale & definitive. C'est sur la valeur moyenne fixee par un des trois modes mentionnes ci-dessus, que devra etre reglee en tout etat de cause la compensation qui sera accordee pour chaque esclave pour lequel on reconnoitra par la suite, qu'une indemnite est due.
ARTICLE III. Lorsque le prorata aura ete ainsi arrete, les deux commissaires se constitueront, en conseil pour 1'examen des reclamations qui leur seront soumises, & ils notifieront au Secretaire d'Etat des Etats-Unis, qu'ils sont prets a recevoir la liste definitive des esclaves & autres proprietes privees pour lesquels les citoyens des Etats-Unis reclament une indemnite. Il est entendu que les commissaires ne sauroient examiner ni recevoir, & que Sa Majeste Britannique ne sauroit, en vertu des clauses de Particle lr du traite de Gand, bonifier aucune pretention, qui ne seroit pas portee sur la dite liste. Sa Majeste Britannique s'engage d'autre part a ordonner, que tous les temoignages que son gouvernement peut avoir acquis par les rapports des officiers de sa dite Majeste ou par tout autre canal sur le nombre des esclaves emmenes, soyent mis sous les yeux des commissaires, afin de contribuer a la verification des faits. Mais soit que ses temoignages viennent a etre produits, soit qu'ils manquent, cette circonstance ne pourra porter prejudice a une reclamation ou aux reclamations qui par une autre voie seront legitimees d'une maniere satisfaisante.
ARTICLE IV. Les deux Commissaires sont autorises et charges d'entrer dans 1'examen de toutes les reclamations qui leur seront soumises au moyen de la liste cidessus mentionnee, par les proprietaires d'esclaves ou les possesseurs d'autres proprietes, ou par les procureurs ou mandataires de ceux-

according to the merits of the several cases, under the rule of the Imperial decision herein above recited, and having reference, if need there be, to the explanatory documents hereunto annexed, marked A and B. And in considering such claims, the Commissioners are empowered and required to examine, on oath or affirmation, all such persons as shall come before them, touching the real number of the slaves, or value of other property, for which indemnification is claimed: and, also, to receive in evidence, according as they may think consistent with equity and justice, written depositions or papers, such depositions or papers being duly authenticated, either according to existing legal forms, or in such other manner as the said Commissioners shall see cause to require or allow.
ARTICLE V.
In the event of the two commissioners not agreeing in any particular case under examination, or of their disagreement upon any question which may result from the stipulations of this convention, then and in that case they shall draw by lot the name of one of the two arbitrators, who, after having given due consideration to the matter contested, shall consult with the commissioners; and a final decision shall be given, conformably to the opinion of the majority of the two commissioners, and of the arbitrator so drawn by lot. And the arbitrator, when so acting with the two commissioners, shall be bound in all respects by the rules of proceeding enjoined by the fourth article of this convention upon the commissioners, and shall be vested with the same powers, and be deemed, for that case, a commissioner.

The decision of the commissioners shall be final. His Britannic Majesty engages to pay the sums awarded in specie. Proviso.

ARTICLE VI. The decision of the two commissioners, or of the majority of the board, as constituted by the preceding article, shall in all cases be final and conclusive, whether as to number, the value or the ownership of the slaves, or other property, for which indemnification is to be made. And his Britannic Majesty engages to cause the sum awarded to each and every owner in lieu of his slave or slaves, or other property, to be paid in specie, without deduction, at such time or times, and at such place or places, as shall be awarded by the said commissioners, and on condition of such releases or assignments to be given, as they shall direct: provided that no such payment shall be fixed to take place sooner than twelve months from the day of the exchange of the ratifications of this convention.

The commissioners and arbitrators to be paid as shall be agreed upon, &c.

ARTICLE VII. It is farther agreed, that the commissioners and arbitrators shall be respectively paid in such manner as shall be settled between the governments of the United States and Great Britain, at the time of the exchange of the ratifications of this convention. And all other expenses attending the execution of the commission, shall be defrayed jointly by the United States and His Britannic Majesty, the same being previously ascertained and allowed by the majority of the board.

La decision finale sera prise conformement a 1'opinion de la majorite des deux commissaires & de 1'arbitre tire au sort.

A.
Count Nesselrode to Mr. Middleton.
The undersigned Secretary of State, directing the Imperial administration of Foreign Affairs, has the honor to communicate to Mr. Middleton, Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States of America, the opinion which the Emperor, his master, has thought it his duty to express upon the object of the differences which have arisen between the United States and Great Britain, relative to the interpretation of the first article of the Treaty of Ghent.
Mr. Middleton is requested to consider this opinion as the award required of the Emperor by the two powers.
He will doubtless recollect, that he, as well as the Plenipotentiary of His Britannic Majesty, in all his memorials, has principally insisted on the grammatical sense of the first article of the Treaty of Ghent, and that, even in his note of the 4th [16th] November, 1821, he has formally declared, that it was on the signification of the words in the text of the article as it now is, that the decision of His Imperial Majesty
should be founded. The same declaration being made in the note of the British Plenipo-
tentiary, dated Sth [20th] October, 1821, the Emperor had only to conform to the wishes expressed by the two parties, by devoting all his attention to the examination of the grammatical question.
The above mentioned opinion will show the manner in which His Imperial Majesty judges of this question: and in order that the cabinet of Washington may also know the motives upon which the Emperor's judgment is founded, the undersigned has hereto subjoined an extract of some observations upon the literal sense of the first article of the
Treaty of Ghent. In this respect, the Emperor has confined himself to following the
rules of the language employed in drawing up the act, by which the two powers have required his arbitration, and defined the object of their
difference. His Imperial Majesty has thought it his duty, exclusively, to obey the
authority of these rules, and his opinion could not but be the rigorous and necessary consequence thereof.
The undersigned eagerly embraces this occasion to renew to Mr. Middleton the assurances of his most distinguished consideration.
