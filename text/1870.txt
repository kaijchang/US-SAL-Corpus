Description of the Improvements. -- A. Main building on the northern Improvements.
front. -- The northern or avenue front will be appropriated to an edifice which consists, as per design, of projecting pavilions, with deep returns on Seventh and Ninth streets. These are five stories in height above the ground, exclusive of the prominent Mansard roofs ; further, it consists of connecting wings, four stories high above ground, and having also Mansard roofs. The main part of this building will be eighty feet in depth, exclusive of wide projections at center and at ends, towards the south, and
of light ornamental projections to the north. The first story of this building is occupied by stores, and the upper
stories will contain all the necessary and useful accommodations for offices, rooms, or other lawful purposes, the servants' department of which is located in a basement, which has also cellars for the stores, and the necessary cold-air ducts, hot-air flues, coils of steam-pipes, chambers and fixtures for heating all the rooms and corridors of the whole building with low-pressure steam generated in non-explosive boilers, walled in fireproof. Among the modern accommodations are prominent separate elevators, with best mechanical appliances for the conveyance of persons and baggage to the different stories; liberal allowances for lobbies, public and private parlors, reading rooms, large and well-ventilated modern public and private halls, suites of rooms and single rooms, with communicating bath-rooms and alcoves, good-sized plain rooms, spacious corridors, twelve feet in width, easy and wide stairways in sufficient number, which afford easy egress in case of alarms ; further, large dust shafts through the house ; also speaking-tubes in all directions, electric bells and clocks.
The whole avenue front, as well as the fronts of the pavilions, returned around their northern corners on Seventh and Ninth streets, will be faced with granite for entrance story, and with marble or cut sandstone of equal style and durability for uppei' stories up to the main cornice. The ornamental and molded or carved trimmings of the windows, and other details implying the art of the sculptor, will be constructed of metal. All the above cut-stone and ornamental work to be backed with and anchored to brick work of proportionate thickness, consisting of best hardburnt bricks, laid in cement mortar. The Mansard roofs will be covered with ornamental slate laid to chaste and tasty patterns ; the roof of the cupola will be covered in likewise with projecting ribs of galvanized metal running up along the hips, and the prominent parts of which are gilded. The flat part of the Mansard roofs will receive a metal covering, laid on English felt, the scroll-work forming the crest-railings along the upper edges of the French roofs ; and all similar parts, whether purely constructive or decorative, wherever they are exposed to the destructive agency of the elements, will be of cast or wrought iron, and bronzed. The shell of the building, respectively, the substance and finish of its exterior being thus clearly defined, we now proceed to specify the character and
substance of construction and interior finish. The foundations and cellar walls to be started upon two courses of blue-
stones, of extra size, well bedded on the natural ground, and flushed in solid with good cement mortar. All the foundations to go down to solid natural ground, and wherever this or its equivalent cannot be obtained,
recourse must be had to pile foundations. The basement and cellar walls will be built with best blue-stone ma-
sonry, laid in cement mortar; the floors of cellars and basement to consist of a layer of concrete, consisting of cement, brickbats, and broken stones in due proportions and of a proportionate thickness for the different purposes. The floors to be laid upon this substratum of cement will consist of bricks, pure cement, or wooden flooring, as the considerations of
safety, health, and comfort of the occupants will require. The ceiling of the cellar, or, rather, floor of the entrance story, will be
constructed fire-proof, of rolled iron beams with intermediate brick arches

wherever any remote danger may be apprehended, but those sections be-

tween the stores and their cellars will be laid with wooden joists, the

intervals between which will be counter-ceiled and filled in with a layer

of hair-mortar two inches thick. All the wooden floors of the building

which separate the upper stories will be constructed with these same pre-

cautions against the progress or communication of fire from one story to

another.

The floors of lobby and private entrances to the upper stories will be

laid with encaustic English tile, and the rest of the floors of this and the

upper stories of best narrow North Carolina pine.

All the principal partitions of entrance story to be constructed of brick-

work.

The fronts of the stores to consist mainly of French plate glass of first

quality, set in hard-wood finish.

The upper stories will be divided off by what externally shows as pa-

vilions, into fire-proof compartments formed by substantial brick partition

walls; but the minor subdivisions will be formed by studded partitions,

thoroughly bridged and trussed where necessary, all plastered in three-

coat work with hard finish, proportionate cornices, pilaster-caps and cen-

ter-pieces of ornamental stucco-work for the more prominent rooms.

The outside walls must be stripped and lathed, preparatory to plaster-

ing.

All the windows to have double box frames and one and three-quarter

inch thick sash.

Ornamental and heavy marble mantels for all the principal rooms. All

the hardware required will be of the best American manufacture, suffi-

ciently strong for the different purposes, and in elegance graduated for

the different stories and departments.

Particular attention must be paid to the successful and substantial exe-

cution of the plumber's work, with galvanized iron supply-pipes for Poto-

mac water, sufficiently large to feed fire-plugs for two-inch hose in each

and`every story. Globe valves or compression stopcocks must be intro-

duced in sufficient numbers to shut off each story, and again, each bath-

room, or section of the work, independently, so as to reduce the inconven-

iences to the particular locality where any repairs may be required

hereafter. These stopcocks must be connected by tubes with the waste-

pipes, so as to empty the pipes without the possibility of injury to the

building. All the plumber's fixtures, such as stationary wash-trays,

ranges, sinks, washstands, water-closets, urinaries, and bath-tubs, must be

of the best and most approved patterns and manufacture ; all of them

will have independent, large-sized stink-traps, with trap-screws to afford

best facilities for removing any obstructions. All this plumber's work in

upper stories must be set on lead-lined floors, which must be connected

by trapped tubes with the waste-pipes, so as not to expose the rooms to

any contingencies of overflows by leaks in the connections of fixtures

with pipes. All the wash-trays and sinks to be of soapstone or enameled

Sec . 42.

more than he had a right to claim as new, if the error has arisen by inadvertence, accident, or mistake, and without any fraudulent or deceptive intention, the commissioner shall, on the surrender of such patent and the payment of the duty required by law', cause a new patent for the same invention, and in accordance with the corrected specification, to be issued to the patentee, or, in the case of his death or assignment of the whole or any undivided part of the original patent, to his executors, administrators, or assigns, for the unexpired part of the term of the original patent, the surrender of which shall take effect upon the issue of the amended patent; and the commissioner may, in his discretion, cause several patents to be issued for distinct and separate parts of the thing patented, upon demand of the applicant, and upon payment of the required fee for a reissue for each of such reissued letters-patent. And the specifications and claim in every such case shall be subject to revision and restriction in the same manner as original applications are. And the patent so reissued, together with the corrected specification, shall have the effect and operation in law, on the trial of all actions for causes thereafter arising, as though the same had been originally filed in such corrected form; but no new matter shall be introduced into the specification, nor in case of a machine patent shall the model or drawings be amended, except each by the other; but when there is neither model nor drawing, amendments may be made upon proof satisfactory to the commissioner that such new matter or amendment was a part of the original invention, and was omitted from the specification by inad-
vertence, accident, or mistake, as aforesaid. Sec . 54. And be it further enacted, That whenever, through inadver-
tence, accident, or mistake, and without any fraudulent or deceptive intention, a patentee has claimed more than that of which he was the original or first inventor or discoverer, his patent shall be valid for all that part which is truly and justly his own, provided the same is a material or substantial part of the thing patented ; and any such patentee, his heirs or assigns, whether of the whole or any sectional interest therein, may, on payment of the duty required by law,' make disclaimer of such parts of the thing patented as he shall not choose to claim or to hold by virtue of the patent or assignment, stating therein the extent of his interest in such patent; said disclaimer shall be in writing, attested by one or more witnesses, and recorded in the patent office, and it shall thereafter be considered as part of the original specification to the extent of the interest possessed by the claimant and by those claiming under him after the record thereof. But no such disclaimer shall affect any action pending at the time of its being filed, except so far as may relate to the question of unreasonable neglect or delay in filing it.
Sec . 55. And be it further enacted, That all actions, suits, controversies, and cases arising under the patent laws of the United States shall be originally cognizable, as well in equity as at law, by the circuit courts of the United States, or any district court having the powers and jurisdiction of a circuit court, or by the supreme court of the District of Columbia, or of any Territory; and the court shall have power, upon bill in equity filed by any party aggrieved, to grant injunctions according to the course and principles of courts of equity, to prevent the violation of any right secured by patent, on such terms as the court may deem reasonable; and upon a decree being rendered in any such case for an infringement, the claimant [complainant] shall be entitled to recover, in addition to the profits to be accounted for by the defendant, the damages the complainant has sustained thereby, and the court shall assess the same or cause the same to be assessed under its direction, and the court shall have the same powers to increase the same in its discretion that are given by this act to increase the damages found by verdicts in actions upon the case; but all actions shall be brought during the term for which the letters-patent shall be granted
or extended, or within six years after the expiration thereof.

And I do further declare and proclaim that it has been officially communicated to the government of the United States by the Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of his Majesty the Emperor of the French, at Washington, that orders have been given that in the conduct of the war the commanders of the French forces on land and on the seas shall scrupulously observe towards neutral powers the rules of international law, and that they shall strictly adhere to the principles set forth in the declaration of the Congress of Paris of the 16th of April, 1856, that is to say : 1st. That privateering is and remains abolished. 2d. That the neutral flag covers enemy's goods with the exception of contraband of war. 3d. That neutral goods, with the exception of contraband of war, are not liable to capture under the enemy's flag. 4th. That blockades, in order to be binding, must be effective, that is to say, maintained by a force sufficient really to prevent access to the coast of the enemy ; and that, although the United States have not adhered to the declaration of 1856, the vessels of his Majesty will not seize enemy's property found on board of a vessel of the United States, provided that property is not contraband of war.
And I do further declare and proclaim that the statutes of the United States and the law of nations alike require that no person, within the territory and jurisdiction of the United States, shall take part, directly or indirectly, in the said war, but shall remain at peace with each of the said belligerents, and shall maintain a strict and impartial neutrality, and that whatever privileges shall be accorded to one belligerent within the ports of the United States, shall be, in like manner, accorded to the other.

And I do hereby give notice that all citizens of the United States and others who may claim the protection of this government, who may misconduct themselves in the premises, will do so at their peril, and that they can in no wise obtain any protection from the government of the United States against the consequences of their misconduct.
