Be it enacted J)y the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That section 16(b) (1) of the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act, as
amended, is amended to read as follows: "(1) the Secretary is authorized, within the amounts of such
appropriations as may be provided therefor, to enter into contracts of not to exceed ten years with owners and operators of land iu thc Great Plains area having such control as the Secretary determines to be needed of the farms, ranches, or other lands covered thereby; but such contracts shall be entered into with respect to lands, other than farms or ranches, only where erosion is so serious as to make such contracts necessary for the protection of farm or ranch lands. Such contracts shall be designed to assist farm, ranch, or other land owners or operators to make, in orderly progression over a period of years, changes in their cropping systems or land uses w^hich are needed to conserve, develop, protect, and utilize the soil and water resources of their farms, ranches, and other lands and to install the soil and water conservation measures and carry out the practices needed under such changed systems and uses. Such contracts may be entered into during the period ending not later than December 31, 1981, with respect to farms, ranches, and other lands in counties in the Great Plains area of the States of Colorado, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming, designated by the Secretary as susceptible to serious wind erosion by reason of their soil types, terrain, and climatic and other factors. The land owner or operator shall furnish to the Secretary a plan of farming operations or land use which incorporates such soil and water conservation practices and principles as may be determined by him to be practicable for maximum mitigation of climatic hazards of the area in which such land is located, and which outlines a schedule of proposed changes in cropping systems or land use and of the conservation measures which are to be carried out on the farm, ranch, or other land during the contract period to protect the farm, ranch, or other land from erosion and deterioration by natural causes. Such plan may also include practices and measures for (a) enhancing fish and wildlife and recreation resources, (b) promoting the economic use of land, and (c) reducing or controlling agricultural related pollution. Inclusion in the farm plan of these practices shall be the exclusive decision of the land owner or operator. Approved conservation plans of land owners and operators developed in cooperation with the soil and water conservation district in which their lands are situated shall form a basis for contracts. Under the contract the land owner or operator shall agree--
" (i) to effectuate the plan for his farm, ranch, or other land substantially in accordance with the schedule outlined therein unless any requirement thereof is waived or modified by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subsection;
"(ii) to forfeit all rights to further payments or grants under the contract and refund to the United States all payments or grants received thereunder upon his violation of the contract at any stage during the time he has control of the land if the Secretary, after considering the recommendations

83 STAT. ]

of the soil and water conservation district board, determines that such violation is of such a nature as to warrant termination of the contract, or to make refunds or accept such payment adjustments as the Secretary may deem appropriate if he determines that the violation by the owner or operator does not warrant termination of the contract;
"(iii) upon transfer of his right and interest in the farm, ranch, or other land during the contract period to forfeit all rights to further payments or grants under the contract and refund to the United States all payments or grants received thereunder unless the transferee of any such land agrees w^ith the Secretary to assume all obligations of the contract;
"(iv) not to adopt any practice specified by the Secretary in the contract as a practice which would tend to defeat the purposes of the contract;
"(v) to such additional provisions as the Secretary determines are desirable and includes in the contract to effectuate the purposes of the program or to facilitate the practical administration of the program. "In return for such agreement by the landowner or operator the Secretary shall agree to share the cost of carrying out those conservation practices and measures set forth in the contract for which he determines that cost sharing is appropriate and in the public interest. The portion of such cost (including labor) to be shared shall be that part which the Secretary determines is necessary and appropriate to effectuate the physical installation of the conservation practices and measures under the contract;" SEC. 2. Section 16 (b) (2) of said Act is amended to read:
"(2) the Secretary may terminate any contract with a land owner or operator by mutual agreement with the ow^ner or operator if the Secretary determines that such termination would be in the public interest, and may agree to such modification of contracts previously entered into as he may determine to be desirable to carry out the purposes of the program or facilitate the practical administration thereof or to accomplish equitable treatment with respect to other similar conservation, land use, or commodity programs administered by the Secretary;" SEC. 3. Section 16(b) (7) of said Act is amended, to read:
"(7) there is hereby authorized to be appropriated, without fiscal year limitations, such sums as may be necessary to carry out this subsection: Provided^ That the total cost of the program (excluding administrative costs) shall not exceed $300,000,000, and for any program year payments shall not exceed $25,000,000. The funds made available for the program under this subsection may be expended without regard to the maximum payment limitation and small payment increases required under section 8(e) of this Act, and may be distributed among States w^ithout regard to distribution of funds formulas of section 15 of this Act. The
program authorized under this subsection shall be in addition to, and not in substitution of, other programs in such area authorized by this or any other Act."

Whereas all countries issuing patents, and especially countries such as the United States having an examination system, deal with large and constantly growing numbers of patent applications of increasing complexity; and
Whereas in any one country a considerable number of patent applications duplicate or substantially duplicate applications relating to the same inventions in other countries, thereby increasing further the volume of applications to be processed; and
Whereas a resolution of the difficulties attendant upon duplications in filings and examination would result in more economical, quicker, and more effective protection for inventions throughout the world thus benefiting inventors, the general public, and government; and
Whereas a treaty for international patent cooperation providing a central filing, search and examination system should provide a practicable means of resolving the difficulties arising out of the duplications in the filing and examination of patent applications; and
Whereas governments concerned with international patent problems have spent a number of years in consultation and in the development of a draft treaty for international patent cooperation to alleviate these problems: Now, therefore, be it

Resolved hy the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled^ That the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with other concerned departments and agencies, are authorized to take all necessary steps to organize and hold a diplomatic conference to negotiate a Patent Cooperation Treaty in Washington, District of Columbia, in fiscal year 1970.

Samples. Publication in
Federal Register,

gj,^^ 202. (a) Each operator of a coal mine shall take accurate sam-
ples of the amount of respirable dust in the mine atmosphere to which eacli mlucr in the active workings of such mine is exposed. Such samples shall be taken by any device approved by the Secretary and the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare and in accordance with such methods, at such locations, at such intervals, and in such manner as the Secretaries shall prescribe in the Federal Register within sixty days from the date of enactment of this Act and from time to time thereafter. Such samples shall be transmitted to the Secretary in a manner established by him, and analyzed and recorded by him in a manner that will assure application of the provisions of section 104 (i) of this Act when the applicable limit on the concentration of respirable dust required to be maintained under this section is exceeded. The results of such samples shall also be made available to the operator. Each operator shall report and certify to the Secretary at such intervals as the Secretary may require as to the conditions in the active workings of the coal mine, including, but not limited to, the average number of working hours w^orked during each shift, the quantity and velocity of air regularly reaching the working faces, the method of mining, the amount and pressure of the water, if any, reaching the working faces, and the number, location, and type of sprays, if any, used.
(b) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection-- (1) Effective on the operative date of this title, each operator
shall continuously maintain the average concentration of respira-

ble dust in tlie mine atmosphere during each shift to which each miner in the active workings of such mine is exposed at or below 3.0 milligrams of respirable dust per cubic meter of air.
(2) Effective three years after the date of enactment of this Act, each operator shall continuously maintain the average concentration of respirable dust in the mine atmosphere during each shift to which each miner in the active workings of such mine is exposed at or below 2.0 milligrams of respirable dust per cubic meter of air.
(3) Any operator who determines that he will be unable, using available technology, to comply with the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection, or the provisions of paragraph (2) of this subsection, as appropriate, may file with the Panel, no later than sixty days prior to the effective date of the applicable respirable dust standard established by such paragraphs, an application for a permit for noncompliance. If, in the case of an application for a permit for noncompliance with the 3.0 milligram standard established by paragraph (1) of this subsection, the application satisfies the requirements of subsection (c) of this section, the Panel shall issue a permit for noncompliance to the operator. If, in the case of an application for a permit for noncompliance with tiie 2.0 milligram standard established by paragraph (2) of this subsection, the application satisfies the requirements of subsection (c) of this section and the Panel determines that the applicant will be unable to comply with such standard, the Panel shall issue to the operator a permit for noncompliance.
(4) I n any case in which an operator, who has been issued a permit (including a renewal permit) for noncompliance under
this section, determines, not more than ninety days prior to the expiration date of such permit, that he still is unable to comply with the standard established by paragraph (1) of this subsection or the standard established by paragraph (2) of this subsection, as appropriate, he may file with the Panel an application for renewal of the permit. Upon receipt of such application, the Panel, if it determines, after all interested persons have been notified and given an opportunity for a public hearing under section 5 of this Act, that the application is in compliance with the provisions of subsection (c) of this section, and that the applicant will be unable to comply with such standard, may renew the permit.
(5) Any such permit or renewal thereof so issued shall be in effect for a period not to exceed one year and shall entitle the permittee during such period to maintain continuously the average concentration of respirable dust in the mine atmosphere during each shift in the working places of such mine to which the
permit applies at a level specified by the Panel, which shall be at the lowest level which the application shows the conditions, technology applicable to such mine, and other available and effective control techniques and methods will permit, but in no event shall such level exceed 4.5 milligrams of dust per cubic nieter of air during the period when the 3.0 milligram standard is in effect, or 3.0 milligrams of dust per cubic meter of air during the period when the 2.0 milligram standard is in effect.

A copy of the plan shall be furnished the Secretary or his authorized representative and shall be available to the miners and their representatives.
(b) The niethod of mining followed in any coal mine shall not expose the miner to unusual dangers from roof falls caused by excessive widths of rooms and entries or faulty pillar recovery methods.
(c) The operator, in accordance with the approved plan, shall provide at or near each working face and at such other locations in the coal mine as the Secretary may prescribe an ample supply of suitable materials of proper size with which to secure the roof of all working places in a safe manner. Safety posts, jacks, or other approved devices shall be used to protect the workmen when roof material is being taken down, crossbars are being installed, roof boltholes are being drilled, roof bolts are being installed, and in such other circumstances as may be appropriate. Loose roof and overhanging or loose faces and ribs shall be taken down or supported. Except in the case of recovery work, supports knocked out shall be replaced promptly.
(d) When installation of roof bolts is permitted, such roof bolts shall be tested in accordance with the approved roof control plan.
(e) Roof bolts shall not be recovered where complete extractions of pillars are attempted, where adjacent to clay veins, or at the locations of other irregularities, whether natural or otherwise, that induce abnormal hazards. Where roof bolt recovery is permitted, it shall be conducted only in accordance with methods prescribed in the approved roof control plan, and shall be conducted by experienced miners and only where adequate temporary support is provided.
(f) Where miners are exposed to danger from falls of roof, face, and ribs the operator shall examine and test the roof, face, and ribs before any work or machine is started, and as frequently thereafter as may be necessary to insure safety. When dangerous conditions are fovmd, they shall be corrected immediately.

If 1.0 volume per centum or more of methane is detected, electrical equipment shall not be energized, taken into, or operated in, such working place until the air therein contains less than 1.0 volume per centum of metliane. Examinations for methane shall be made during the operation of such equipment at intervals of not more than twenty minutes during each shift, unless more frequent examinations are required by an authorized representative of the Secretary. In conducting such tests, such person shall use means approved by the Secretary for detecting methane.
(2) If at any time the air at any working place, when tested at a point not less than twelve inches from the roof, face, or rib, contains 1.0 volume per centum or more of methane, changes or adjustments shall be made at once in the ventilation in such mine so that such air shall contain less than 1.0 volume per centum of methane. While such changes or adjustments are underway and until they have been achieved, power to electric face equipment located in such place shall be cut off, no other work shall be permitted in such place, and due precautions shall be carried out under the direction of the operator or his agent so as not to endanger other areas of the mine. If at any time such air contains 1.5 volume per centum or more of methane, all persons, except those referred to in section 104(d) of this Act, shall be withdrawn from the area of the mine endangered thereby to a safe area, and all electric power shall be cut off from the endangered area of the mine, until the air in such working place shall contain less than 1.0 volume per centum of methane.

TITLE IV--BLACK LUNG BENEFITS
PART A--GENERAL
SEC. 401. Congress finds and declares that there are a significant number of coal miners living today who are totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis arising out of employment in one or more of the Nation's underground coal mines; that there are a number of survivors of coal miners whose deaths were due to this disease; and that few States provide benefits for death or disability due to this disease 10 coal miners or their surviving dependents. I t is, therefore, the purpose of this title to provide benefits, in cooperation with the States, to coal miners who are totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis and to the surviving dependents of miners whose death was due to such disease; and to ensure that in the future adequate benefits are provided to coal miners and their dependents in the event of their death or total disability due to pneumoconiosis.

FINDINGS

Administration

. Export Admin-
i s t r a t i o n A c t of
1969.

SEC. 2. The Congress makes the following findings: (1) The availability of certain materials at home and abroad varies so that the quantity and composition of United States exports and their distribution among importing countries may affect the welfare of the domestic economy and may have an important bearing upon fulfillment of the foreign policy of the United States.
(2) The unrestricted export of materials, information, and technology without regard to whether they make a significant contribution to the military potential of any other nation or nations may adversely affect the national security of the United States.
(3) The unwarranted restriction of exports from the United States has a serious adverse effect on our balance of payments.
(4) The uncertainty of policj^ toward certain categories of exports has curtailed the efforts of American business in those categories to the detriment of the overall attempt to improve the trade balance of the United States.

DECLARATION OF POLICY
SEC. 3. The Congress makes the following declarations: (1) I t is the policy of the United States both (A) to encourage trade with all countries with which we have diplomatic or trading relations, except those countries with which such trade has been determined by the President to be against the national interest, and (B) to Restrict the export of goods and technology which would make a significant contribution to the military potential of any other nation or nations which would prove detrimental to the national security of the United States.
(2) I t is the policy of the United States to use export controls (A) to the extent necessary to protect the domestic economy from the excessive drain of scarce materials and to reduce the serious inflationary impact of abnormal foreign demand, (B) to the extent necessary to further significantly the foreign policy of the United States and to fulfill its international responsibilities, and (C) to the extent necessary to exercise the necessary vigilance over exports from the standpoint of their significance to the national security of the United States.
(3) I t is the policy of the United States (A) to formulate, reformulate, and apply an^ necessary controls to the maximum extent possible in cooperation with all nations with which the United States has defense treaty commitments, and (B) to formulate a unified trade control policy to be observed by all such nations.

(4) It is the policy of the United States to use its economic resources and trade potential to further the sound growth and stability of its economy as well as to further its national security and foreign policy objectives.
(^) ^^ ^^ ^^ poHcy of the United States (A) to oppose restrictive trade practices or boycotts fostered or imposed by foreign countries against other countries friendly to the United States, and (B) to encourage and request domestic concerns engaged in the export of articles, materials, supplies, or information, to refuse to take any action, including the furnishing of information or the signing of agreements, which has the effect of furthering or supporting the restrictive trade practices or boycotts fostered or imposed by any foreign country against another country friendly to the United States.

AUTHORITY

SEC. 4. (a) (1) The Secretary of Commerce shall institute such organizational and procedural changes in any office or division of the Department of Commerce which has heretofore exercised functions relating to the control of exports and continues to exercise such controls under this Act as he determines are necessary to facilitate and effectuate the fullest implementation of the policy set forth in this Act with a view to promoting trade with all nations with which the United States is engaged in trade, including trade with (A) those countries or groups of countries with which other countries or groups of countries having defense treaty commitments with the United States have a significantly larger percentage of volume of trade than does the United States, and (B) other countries eligible for trade with the United States but not significantly engaged in trade with the United States. In addition, the Secretary shall review any list of articles, materials, or supplies, including technical data or other information, the exportation of which from the United States, its territories and possessions, was heretofore prohibited or curtailed with a view to making promptly such changes and revisions in such list as may be necessary or desirable in furtherance of the policy, purposes, and provisions of this Act. The Secretary shall include a detailed statement with respect to actions taken in compliance with the provisions of this paragraph in the second quarterly report (and in any subsequent report with respect to actions taken during the preceding quarter) made by him to the Congress after the date of enactment of this Act pursuant to section 10.
(2) The Secretary of Commerce shall use all practicable means available to him to keep the business sector of the Nation fully apprised of changes in export control policy and procedures instituted in conformity with this Act with a view to encouraging the widest possible trade.
(b) To effectuate the policies set forth in section 3 of this Act, the President may prohibit or curtail the exportation from the United States, its territories and possessions, of any articles, materials, or supplies, including technical data or any other information, except under such rules and regulations as he shall prescribe. To the extent necessary to achieve effective enforcement of this Act, these rules and regulations may apply to the financing, transporting, and other servicing of exports and the participation therein by any person. Rules and

83 STAT. ]

PUBLIC LAW 91-184-DEC. 30, 1969

regulations may provide for denial of any request or application for authority to export articles, materials, or supplies, including technical data, or any other information, from the United States, its territories and possessions, to any nation or combination of nations threatening the national security of the United States if the President determines that their export would prove detrimental to the national security of the United States, regardless of their availability from nations other than any nation or combination of nations threatening the national security of the United States, but whenever export licenses are required on the ground that considerations of national security override considerations of foreign availability, the reasons for so doing shall be reported to the Congress in the quarterly repoit following the decision to require such licenses on that ground to the extent considerations of national security and foreign policy permit. The rules and regulations shall implement the provisions of section 3(5) of this Act and shall require that all domestic concerns receiving requests for the furnishing of information or the signing of agreements as specified in that section must report this fact to the Secretary of Commerce for such action as he may deem appropriate to carry out the purposes of that section.
(c) Nothing in this Act, or in the rules and regulations authorized by it, shall in any way be construed to require authority and permission to export articles, materials, supplies, data, or information except where the national security, the foreign policy of the LTnited States, or the need to protect the domestic economy from the excessive drain of scarce materials makes such requirement necessary.
(d) The President may delegate the power, authority, and discretion conferred upon him by this Act to such departments, agencies, or officials of the Government as he may deem appropriate.
(e) The authority conferred by this section shall not be exercised with respect to any agricultural commodity, including fats and oils, during any period for which the supply of such commodity is determined by the Secretary of Agriculture to be in excess of the requirements of the domestic economy, except to the extent required to effectuate the policies set forth in clause (B) or (C) of paragraph (2) of section 3 of this Act.

CONSULTATION AND STANDARDS
SEC. 5. (a) In determining what shall be controlled hereunder, and in determining the extent to which exports shall be limited, any department, agency, or official making these determinations shall seek information and advice from the several executive departments and independent agencies concerned with aspects of our domestic and foreign policies and operations having an important bearing on exports. Consistent with considerations of national security, the President shall from time to time seek information and advice from various segments of private industry in connection with the making of these determinations.
(b) I n authorizing exports, full utilization of private competitive trade channels shall be encouraged insofar as practicable, giving consideration to the interests of small business, merchant exporters as well as producers, and established and new exporters, and provision shall be

Proclamation 3880
VETERANS DAY, 1968
By the President of tlie United States of America
A Proclamation
Fifty years ago this fall, on November 11, 1918, America and her allies won a great victory after hard and cruel combat. That Armistice Day half a century past ended history's first World War, and struck in the world's hearts the hope of endurmg peace.
After little more than a generation, that fragile hope was extinguished in the flames of World W a r I I . And hardly had its guns been stilled when another conflict--in Korea--revealed in anguish that aggression could threaten the community of men in 1950 no less than in 1917 or 1941.
Today, Pershing's young doughboys are living in the golden years of their retirement. The warriors of World W a r I I and Korea are slipping into middle age. A thousand battlefields, stretching in time and place from Chateau-Thierry to the slopes of Suribachi to the streets of Seoul are consecrated ground, where Americans fought--and many fell--to defy aggression, to preserve freedom, to protect the security of their people.
Now America's sons are waging that same bitter fight anew. They stand on alien land, as their fathers and their grandfathers stood before them, to deny aggression its hope of conquest, to keep freedom from dying under an invader's heel, to give us all the priceless right to live secure and safe. They are trained and equipped better than any American force before them. But their stand is no less harsh and lonely. Their courage and their spirit are the equal of any generation's. And their sacrifices, in our name and in the cause of all we cherish, are as hard as men have ever made on the battlefields of war.
We provide material benefits to the veterans of all our wars. We have continually extended and improved those benefits to meet more fully the debt we owe them.
But each year we also pause to pay them another kind of tribute. I n our prayers and thoughts and ceremonies, we honor the men to whom we owe our safety, our freedom, and the continued existence of

NOW, T H E E E F O E E , I , L Y N D O N B . J O H N S O N , President of the United States of America, urge the people of this nation to join in commemorating Monday, November 11, 1968, as Veterans Day with suitable observances.
I direct the appropriate officials of the Government to arrange for the display of the flag of the United States on all public buildings on that day; and I request the officials of Federal, State, and local governments, and civic and patriotic organizations, to give their enthusiastic leadership and support to appropriate public ceremonies throughout the nation.
I ask that all citizens of every age take part in these observances which honor those whose unqualified loyalty and patriotism have preserved our freedom.

A Proclamation

Americans, looking back on the tumultuous events of 1968, may be more inclined to ask God's mercy and guidance than to offer H i m thanks for his blessings.

There are many events in this year that deserve our remembrance, and give us cause for thanksgiving:

--the endurance and stability of our democracy, as we prepare once more for an orderly transition of authority;

--the renewed determination, on the part of millions of Americans, to bridge our divisions;

--the beginning of talks with our adversaries, that will, we pray, lead to peace in Vietnam;

--the increasing prosperity of our people, including those who were denied any share in America's blessings in the past;

--the achievement of new breakthroughs in medical science, and new victories over disease.

These events inspire not only the deepest gratitude, but confidence that our nation, the beneficiary of good fortune beyond that of any nation in history, will surmount its present trials and achieve a more just society for its people.

HUMAN RIGHTS WEEK

By fhe President of the United States of America

December 7, i968

A Proclamation
This year has marked the twentieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights--set forth in 1948 by the United Nations as a common standard for all mankind. I t has been a year for thoughtful men in every continent to rededicate themselves to strengthening and extending the rights of man.

The United States has been a world leader in the struggle for human rights. The ideals w4iich the Declaration of Human Rights embodies gave birth to our Nation almost two centuries ago. Our concern for individual freedom is deep, abiding and genuine. It is the very foundation of the American system.
The doctrine is guaranteed by our Constitution, by legislation enacted by the Congress, by decisions of the Supreme Court and by Executive action. But today more than ever, its promises must be matched by practice. Equal rights must be translated into equal opportunities.
Education about human rights must start in the home and continue from kindergarten through graduate school. Our schools and colleges must grasp the meaning of their responsibility to teach the history of the long struggle for human rights.
Human rights will take a firmer place in international law as all nations, including our own, ratify human rights conventions.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, LYNDON B. J O H N S O N , President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim December 10, 1968, as Human Rights Day, and December 15, 1968, as Bill of Rights Day, and call upon the people of the United States to observe the week of December 10-17 as Human Rights Week.
I n observance of Human Rights Week, I call upon the American people and upon all agencies of government--Federal, State, and local--to pay homage to our great heritage of liberty, to seek to understand the human rights that we now enjoy, and to respect the rights of others.

WRIGHT BROTHERS DAY, 1968

December 16,1968

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Sixty-five years ago, two bicycle makers--two amazingly inventive and persevering young brothers from Ohio--made four flights in one day with a machine that was heavier than air and propelled by motor.

Their first journey was shorter than the floor of the giant C-5 cargo ship that was test flown earlier this year. But those brief flights, in the sand hill area outside Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, on December 17, 1903, launched the air age. They changed mankind's way of life.

Orville and Wilbur Wright gave their names to history. Through their determination to master the secret of flight, they symbolized American ingenuity and courage. I t is fitting that we should commemorate their achievement, as w^e enjoy the tremendous advances in convenient travel that have evolved from it.

36 use 169.

To this end, the Congress by a joint resolution approved December 17, 1963 (77 Stat. 402), has designated the seventeenth day of December of each year as Wright Brothers Day, and has requested the President to issue annually a proclamation inviting the people of the United States to observe that day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.

NOW, T H E E E F O E E , I , L Y N D O N B. J O H N S O N , President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon the people of this Nation, and their local and national government officials, to observe Wright Brothers Day, December 17,1968, with appropriate ceremonies and activities, both to recall the accomplishments of the W r i g h t Brothers and to provide a stimulus to aviation in this country and throughout the world.

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Because of the deep debt of gratitude of the American people to Franklin Delano Roosevelt for his leadership in America's struggle for peace, well-being, and human dignity, the Congress established the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial Commission, by the Act of August 11, 1955, 69 Stat. 694, for the purpose of considering and formulating plans for the design, construction, and location of a permanent memorial to Franklin Delano Roosevelt in the City of Washington, District of Columbia, or in its immediate environs.
I n furtherance of the objectives of that Act, the Act of September 1, 1959, 73 Stat. 445, reserved, for the erection of a memorial to Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a site comprising that portion of West Potomac Park in the District of Columbia which lies between Independence Avenue and the inlet bridge, being twenty-seven acres, more or less, and also provided for a competition for the design of such memorial.
Although the Commission has not yet reported to the Congress its selection of an appropriate memorial, it is desirable that the site be maintained, pending the Commission's final determination, as a park dedicated to the memory of Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, L Y N D O N B. J O H N S O N , President of the United States of America, do proclaim that the following described land reserved by the Act of September 1, 1959, be designated as the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial Park area of the West Potomac Park:

Brilliant advances have been scored in cardiovascular research in recent years. But heart disease remains a formidable threat to our national well-being. I t clouds the future of thousands of children. I t cuts down men and women in their most productive years.
Nearly every 30 seconds, someone in the United States dies of some form of heart disease. Last year, it took the lives of approximately one million people--over half of all deaths in the Nation. I t incapaci-

tates or hampers millions of others, in varying degrees, from living a full and active life.
Heart disease is costly not only to the afflicted but also to the Nation. The cost of medical care for heart and circulatory disease victims exceeds $2.5 billion annually. Lost wages and productivity due to illness and disability are estimated at about $3.5 billion. The loss of future earnings of those who die from heart and blood vessel disease each year is estimated to be in excess of $19 billion.
Despite the magnitude of the heart disease problem, the progress that has been made is encouraging. Today, some heart disease can be prevented. Greatly improved methods of diagnosis and treatment are more readily available to those who are stricken. The death rate is declining in all but one of the main categories of cardiovascular disease.
This progress has resulted in large part from a collaborative undertaking, led by the National Heart Institute as the principal Federal partner and the American Heart Association as the major voluntary ally. Public, professional, and private interests have been mobilized in a truly national endeavor agamst heart disease. Through this effort, buttressed by a determination to employ every necessary resource, we can continue to move ahead. With the firm support of all our people, the conquest of heart disease can be achieved.
For such reasons, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved December 30, 1963 (77 Stat. 843), requested the President to issue annually a proclamation designating February as American Heart Month.
NOW, T H E E E F O R E , I , R I C H A R D N I X O N , President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the month of February 1969 as American Heart Month, and I invite the Governors of the States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and officials of other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to issue similar proclamations.
I urge the people of the United States to give heed to the nationwide problem of heart disease, and to support programs essential to bring about its solution.

g / the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

For more than a century, men and women of good will have recognized one symbol as being representative of human compassion.

That symbol, revered throughout the world, is a banner bearing a red cross on a field of white. Under it, citizens of all nations strive to bring aid and comfort to the stricken, to heal the sick, and to serve those in distress.

As a member of that world fraternity, our American Red Cross helps each of us to help our fellow man.

Through its concern and aid for members of our Armed Forces in 30 countries around the globe, the Red Cross last year gave help to great numbers of servicemen and their families.

Each year, the Red Cross brings emergency aid and long-range assistance to victims of major catastrophies, and help to sufferers of thousands of local disasters. For the past several years it has been intensifying its efforts to involve all segments of society in the great work of volunteering to help others.

Every day thousands of hospitals and physicians look to the Red Cross to provide life-saving blood and blood products for their patients. Nearly fifty percent of all the blood used in this country comes from this source.

Each year millions of Americans of all ages participate in Red Cross classes, learning the skills of first aid, home care of the sick and injured, swimming and lifesaving.

More than two million trained volunteers devote their time and abilities to working with patients in military and civilian hospitals, clinics, and homes for the aged, with youth, and in community programs seeking to meet the needs of disadvantaged people.

Proclamation 3895

SAVE YOUR VISION WEEK, 1969

By the President of the United States of America

February 22, i969

A Proclamation

Eyes are too precious to neglect, and every individual or family should take every precaution to protect the gift of sight.

If detected and treated early, most disorders that might reduce vision or cause blindness can be stopped before the eyes are seriously damaged.

Periodic examinations will reveal such disorders, and I urge every adult who has not had an eye examination in the past two years to arrange for such an examination promptly. A re-examination should be had at the first indication of visual defect or impairment.

Other preventive measures can be taken to protect sight. Proper illumination in the home and at work is essential. And, with a little forethought and caution, accidents to the eyes can be avoided--for example, by wearing protective glasses or safety goggles when engaged in hazardous sport or work, and by shielding the eyes from strong sunlight or harmful radiation in any form.

Where there are children, special precautions must be taken: making eye examinations a routine part of health care; immunizing against diseases, such as measles, which affect sight; teaching children to care for their eyes as they are taught to care for their teeth; and eliminating hazardous substances, tools, or toys which may cause eye injuries.

Effective preservation of vision requires not only individual and family responsibility but also an active interest by all citizens in the community's efforts to bring better eye care to all who need it--to the children in the schools, and to the men and women laboring on the farms and in the factories. We must encourage and support medical research to find the causes and cures of visual disorders; support those groups which help the visually handicapped to obtain medical care, education, and rehabilitation so that the^ may live independent and significant lives; and support such organizations as Eye Banks which encourage the pledging of one's eyes for the future good.

To make our people more fully aware of the importance of sightSaving, the Congress by a joint resolution approved December 30, 1963

Proclamation 3896
NATIONAL SAFE BOATING WEEK 1969
Ry fhe President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
I n a time of unprecedented opportunity for leisure-time activities, more and more Americans are discovering the benefits of boating. The ever-increasing traffic on the waterways has made it imperative that all boatmen observe the basic rules of boating safety.
Common sense and courtesy are the two foundations of boating safety. An overloaded boat, failure to heed weather warnings or the taking of other unnecessary risks can, and too often do, lead to boating tragedy. If each boatman takes simple precautions, understands the capabilities of his craft, and exercises ordinary good judgment, tragic losses can be avoided.
Recognizing the need for emphasis on boating safety, the Congress, |3y a joint resolution approved June 4,1958 (72 Stat. 179) has requested that the President proclaim annually the week which includes July 4 as National Safe Boating Week.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I , R I C H A R D N I X O N , President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning June 29, 1969, as National Safe Boating Week.
I urge the public to take advantage of educational courses in boating safety, and all those who use our waterways for boating to exercise courtesy and apply safe boating practices.
I also invite the Governors of the states and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and appropriate officials of all other areas under the United States flag to provide for the observance of this week.
IN W I T N E S S W H E R E O F , I have hereunto set my hand this third day of March, in the year of our Lord, nineteen hundred and sixty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-third.

NATIONAL FARM SAFETY WEEK, 1969

By the President of the United States of America

March 3, 1969

A Proclamation

American agriculture has advanced more in the past 50 years than in all our prior history. A third as many farmers are feeding twice as many Americans today as in 1920. I n addition, America is the world's largest exporter of agricultural products, and our abundance is a powerful force for world peace.

Fundamental to this unparalleled achievement in food and fiber production have been the strong hands and management skills of our farm people. While their accomplishments have dramatically increased production, our farm people have suffered a tragic toll of accidents.

Agriculture continues to rank third among our industries in accidental death rate. Thousands of farm residents are fatally injured every year and hundreds of thousands disabled. The dollar cost to the nation approaches $2 billion, but the cost in pain, grief, and suffering cannot be measured.

The first day of May has been set aside by the Congress of the United States as L A W DAY, U.S.A. I t is a special day to be observed by the American people in appreciation of their liberties and national independence. I t is an occasion for rededication to the ideals of equality and justice under law.
There was never a greater need for such rededication. Events of recent years--rising crime rates, urban rioting, and violent campus protests--have impeded rather than advanced social justice.

We must reverse the upward trend of lawlessness in our land. We must bring forward in America our faith in ourselves and in our country and its future. We must move forward to a new era of peace and progress in which our great resources can be utilized to end poverty and injustice and to achieve greater opportunities for all Americans.
Achievement of these goals does not depend upon the acts of government alone; it depends in substantial part upon the attitude and actions of each of us. We must recognize a clear duty to obey the laws, to respect the rights of others, to resolve controversies by lawful means, to become responsive and responsible citizens.
Unequal justice is no justice at all, unenforced laws are worse than no laws at all; that is why equal justice under law is the bedrock of the American system.
NOW, T H E R E F O E E , I, R I C H A R D N I X O N , President of the United States of America, do hereby urge the people of the United States to observe Thursday, May 1, 1969, as Law T>3ij in the United States of America with appropriate public ceremonies and by the reaffirmation of their dedication to our form of government and the supremacy of law in our lives. I especially urge the legal profession, the schools and educational institutions, civic and service organizations, all media of public information, and the courts to take the lead in sponsoring and participating in appropriate observances throughout the Nation.

Proclamation 3899
SENIOR CITIZENS MONTH, 1969
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
There are today 20 million Americans who are 65 years of age or older.
The older Americans in our midst have been pioneers and builders during a period of dramatic change and severe testing. They remind us of the moral values and personal qualities which have been the basis of our national achievements. Having learned to live with change and challenge, they offer us, now and for the future, a valuable resource of skill and of wisdom.
We are grateful for scientific advances which have given us the longest life expectancy in the history of the world. But we must also be concerned with the quality of that longer life span.
It is therefore fitting that each year we designate one month in honor of older Americans. This is a special time to express our appreciation to older citizens for their services to the Nation, to recognize their potential for further contribution, and to consider whether we

83 STAT. ] PROCLAMATION 3900_MAR. 17, 1969

are doing all we can to assure their full participation in the adventures of our time and in the affluence of our society.
The continuing theme for this special month is MEETING THE CHALLENGE OF THE LATER YEARS. This year, particular emphasis will be given to the concept of PARTNERSHIP in meeting that challenge: partnership among all levels of government, partnership with voluntary organizations, and partnership among Americans of all ages. In addition, the Federal Government's Administration on Aging, in cooperation with the National Safety Council, will conduct an action program on accident prevention and safety for the older generation.
The concerns we express during this special month should also guide us throughout the year. For there is still much pioneering work to be done, work in which all age groups must join as full partners.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, RICHARD NIXON, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the month of May 1969 as Senior Citizens Month.
I invite the Governors of all the States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the officers of the Federal, State, and local governments, the heads of voluntary and private groups, and all Americans everywhere to join in this observance. I ur^e them to find suitable means for expressing appreciation to older citizens, for encouraging their continued and expanded activity, and for meeting the special needs of the frail and the poor and the lonely among them.
I especially invite the older citizens of this Nation to use this month as a time for reexamining the social role which they are playing and the conditions under which they live. And I ask them to share their conclusions and recommendations with their countrymen.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-third.

America's transportation network is an example of democracy at work. Through the years the public and private sectors have joined hands and minds to plan, construct, maintain, and operate vast highway, air, water, rail, and pipeline transport systems.
Today, more than one hundred million private vehicles travel on public ways. And tomorrow--probably within the few years remaining in this century--the total system will need to double today's capacity if it is to carry the projected numbers of people and volume of goods.
Transportation makes all other industries possible. It takes grain to the mills, raw materials to the factories, finished products to the market; it must be designed to give our citizens the mobility they need. Our commerce and culture depend on a revitalized transportation

To give public recognition to this great industry--to focus attention upon its contributions and the challenges it faces--the Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 16, 1957 (71 Stat. 30), has requested the President to proclaim annually the third Friday of May of each year as National Defense Transportation Day, and by a joint resolution approved May 14,1962 (76 Stat. 69), has requested the President to proclaim annually the week of May in which that Friday falls as National Transportation Week, as a tribute to the men and women, who night and day, move our goods and our people throughout the land and around the world.

I urge our people to participate with representatives of the transportation industry, our armed services, and other governmental agencies in the observance of these occasions through appropriate ceremonies.

I also invite the Governors of the States to provide for the observance of National Defense Transportation Day and National Transportation Week in a way that will give the citizens of each community the opportunity to recognize and appreciate fully the vital role our great and modern transportation system plays in their lives and in the defense of the Nation.

WORLD TRADE WEEK, 1969

By the President of the United States of America *AJ40frAi^ I'A I j y A Proclamation

There is a clear interrelationship between America's economic health and that of the rest of the world. I t follows from this that the cause of stability and peace is served by the advancement of free-flowing world trade.
The United States works closely with other nations to promote the expansion of trade on an equitable basis in the world market. Our national trade policy supports the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and other international institutions that seek new ways to facilitate the fair exchange of goods between nations. By reducing barriers to trade the United States and its trading partners have contributed to the growth of the world economy.

As we work toward freer trade, we recognize that our greatest strength lies in the traditional competitive urge of American business and labor. As their international efforts increase their earnings, the nation benefits from a strengthened dollar position and an improved balance of payments.

Exports of United States merchandise rose to a record $34 billion in 1968, $3 billion more than in 1967. Imports of foreign products into the United States, attracted by vigorous domestic economic activity and rising consumer income, reached almost $33 billion, an increase of $6 billion.
Since imports advanced much faster than exports, our trade surplus dropped $3 billion to a total of less than $1 billion. One lesson in this decline is especially important: We must intensify our efforts to contain inflationary pressures at home, helping make our exports more competitive; as our exports expand, we will restore a healthy trade surplus.
Additional outlets are needed for the diversity and abundance of our industrial and agricultural production. We also must find ways to help less developed countries participate more fully in world trade.
Enlarged markets for our goods and services speed the pace of our economic progress and advance the well-being of all our people. New markets abroad create new jobs at home; new avenues of world trade run parallel to new roads to world peace.
Government in the past has helped American industry and agriculture to open up new markets abroad; today we are more willing and better prepared to help than ever before.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, R I C H A R D N I X O N , President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning May 18, 1969, as World Trade Week; and I request the appropriate Federal, State, and local officials to cooperate in the observance of that week.
I urge business, labor, agricultural, educational, professional, and civic groups, as well as the people of the United States generally, to observe World Trade Week with gatherings, discussions, exhibits, ceremonies, and other appropriate activities designed to promote continuing awareness of the importance of world trade to our economy and our relations with other nations.

g^ ^^^ President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Cancer is the second greatest cause of death in the United States. And the death rate from this terrible disease is still rising.
In the past 25 years we have made progress in early diagnosis of certain types of cancer. Greater drug treatment has increased a victim's chances of survival.
While these medical advances are encouraging, it is evident that only the full-hearted commitment by all Americans to support the splendid efforts of our scientists, physicians, health administrators and volunteers will arrest this disease.
In recognition of the urgency of the cancer problem, the Congress, by a joint resolution of March 28, 1938 (52 Stat. 148), requested the President to issue annually a proclamation setting aside the month of April as Cancer Control Month.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, R I C H A R D N I X O N , President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the month of April 1969 as Cancer Control Month, and I invite the Governors of the States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and appropriate officials of all other areas under the United States flag to issue similar proclamations.

LOYALTY DAY, 1969
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
At the founding of our Republic, the signers of the Declaration of Independence pledged their mutual trust and sacred honor to the common ideals of freedom and equality that have brought greatness to our Nation.
Loyalty to our country and its flag must rest on understanding of our great national values which they have represented--individual freedom under the law, equality of opportunity in all walks of life, justice and protection of the law for all. Each of us has an obligation to fulfill these ideals and to preserve them for our children and for succeeding generations.
I t is the function of government in a democracy to provide an orderly framework through which together we can all work constructively toward redeeming the enduring promise of our forefathers' faith. This can be achieved only with the unity and determination of our people. For freedom, justice, and equality are not ideals forever secure, once won. They require our unswerving devotion and our continued vigilance.
I n recognition of the heritage of American freedom, the Congress by a joint resolution of July 18, 1958, designated May 1 of each year as Loyalty Day and requested the President to issue a proclamation inviting the people of the United States to observe such day with appropriate ceremonies.
NOW, T H E R E F O E E , I , E I C H A R D N I X O N , President of the United States of America, do call upon the people of the United States, and upon all patriotic, civic, and educational organizations, to observe Thursday, May 1, 1969, as Loyalty Day, with appropriate ceremonies in which all of us may join m a reaffirmation of our loyalty to the United States of America.

Proclamation 3905
SMALL BUSINESS WEEK, 1969
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
From its beginnings this Nation has honored the common man and has given him unprecedented freedom. It has drawn its strength, in turn, from the determination of the common citizen to use that freedom in his own unique way--from his capacity to be uncommon.
I t was over three centuries ago that small bands of free men laid the foundations of our economic and political system. But the spirit which characterized their efforts is still the essence of the American character. The small businessmen of America best manifest this tradition of individual enterprise.
The American economy has grown affluent beyond the visions of our forefathers. Yet a very important part of it is still represented by the self-owned business: the little shop, the small factory, the family enterprise. They encompass all creeds and races; they exercise their imaginations and pursue their aspirations in a wide variety of enterprises. They provide goods and services of the highest quality; they offer employment opportunities to millions. Their prosperity is fundamental to our economic well-being.
We should recognize, however, that the continued vitality of small business is a matter of political and social concern; a society which encourages free competition cannot easily be subjected to arbitrary control from the top. And a society which opens constructive business opportunities to all of its citizens can liberate and uplift the isolated minorities at the bottom.
NOW, T H E R E F O E E , I, R I C H A R D N I X O N , President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning May 11, 1969, as Small Business Week. I encourage chambers of commerce, boards of trade, and other public and private organizations to observe this w^eek by recognizing the contributions which small business enterprises have made to our national development. I urge them to find appropriate means for paying tribute to the accomplishments of small business, and I trust they will encourage small busmessmen to achieve new successes in the future.

For twenty years, NATO has furthered the cause of Atlantic unity by achieving a spirit of solidarity on many common military, political, and economic problems. By promoting international security through collective defense arrangements and by fostering cooperation in the political realm, NATO has contributed to unprecedented peace and prosperity for all the peoples of the Treaty area.

As long as free men cherish their freedom, Dwight Eisenhower will stand with them, as he stood during war and peace; strong, confident, and courageous. Even in death he nas left us a great spirit that will never die.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, R I C H A R D M.

I also direct that for the same length of time the representatives of the United States in foreign countries shall make similar arrangements for the display of the flag at half-staff over their Embassies, Legations, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities and stations.
I hereby order that suitable honors be rendered by units of the Armed Forces under orders of the Secretary of Defense on the day of the funeral.
I also do appoint Monday, March 31,1969 to be a National Day of Mourning throughout the United States. I earnestly recommend that the people assemble on that day in their respective places of divine worship, there to bow down in submission to the will of the Almighty God, and to pay their homage of love and reverence to the memory of President Eisenhower.

These activities have strengthened government and have helped to sustain the public weal.

Proclamation 3910
MOTHER'S DAY, 1969
gy j^g president of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Fifty-live years ago President Woodrow Wilson called upon the American people to display the flag as "a public expression of our love and reverence for the mothers of the country." The United States of America and the world have changed greatly since then, but the desire and need for a public display of love and affection for our mothers has remained.
How has such a day of commemoration survived the changes of taste, of value, of belief that have marked these years ? I am convinced that the answer lies in the fact that the essential things never change at all. Mother's Day is set aside not only to publicly demonstrate what w^e all privately feel about our mothers, but for another purpose: it serves to remind us all that there is, at the heart of things, a sense of mystery and wonder, a dimly-understood but strongly felt feeling of continuity and interdependence which binds all men together and which is most clearly seen in the miracle of motherhood.
Nowhere in the complexity of the modern world are we more forcefully reminded of the power of love against hate, of creation over destruction, of life against death than in the gentle strength, the deep compassion of a mother.
On Mother's Day we demonstrate to our mothers not only love for who they are but reverence for what they represent: the sacredness of human life and the majesty of the ancient principles which enhance it and guide it toward public and private virtue.
A joint resolution of the Congress, approved on May 8, 1914, sets aside the second Sunday of May as the special day to pay tribute to our mothers.
NOW, T H E R E F O E E , I , R I C H A R D N I X O N , President of the United States of America, do hereby request that Sunday, May 11, 1969, be observed as Mother's D a y ; and I direct the appropriate officials of the Government to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on that day.
I call upon the people of the United States to honor the mothers of our country by displaying the flag at their homes or other suitable places and by expressions of love and respect.

The Constitution of the United States is often viewed as a revered document drawn in a far-off time by a group of exceedingly wise men we call the Founding Fathers. I t is much more than that. The Constitution is a living set of principles, created during a hot Philadelphia summer in 1787 by men who were often passionate in their convictions and always jealous of the basic rights which had been secured by the American Revolution. This Constitution is not a museum-piece, but something as strong and as proud and as passionately alive today as were the men who created it almost 200 years ago.
As the foundation of our national life, the Constitution demands more than reverence. I t demands the kind of active concern we show to anything we deeply care for. I t demands our attention, our understanding of its character and of its fundamental place in our lives. This view of the Constitution will not allow us to pay honor to the idea unless we pay attention to the reality. I t calls upon a citizen to not only be able to demand his rights, but also to know what they are.
United States citizenship, then, is also demanding. But the demands are more than matched by the benefits. Each citizen can help himself, his fellow citizens, and his nation if he takes some time out of his life to read and talk and think about the Constitution.
By a joint resolution of February 29,1952 (66 Stat. 9), the Congress set aside the seventeenth day of September of each year as Citizenship Day, in commemoration of the signing of the Constitution on September 17,1787, and in recognition of all who attained citizenship during the year. And by a joint resolution of August 2, 1956, (70 Stat. 932), the Congress requested the President to designate the period beginning September 17 and ending September 23 of each year as Constitution Week.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, R I C H A R D N I X O N , President of the United States of America, direct the appropriate Government officials to display the flag of the United States on all government buildings on Citizenship Day, September 17,1969. I urge Federal, State, and local officials, as well as all religious, civic, educational, and other interested organizations to make arrangements for impressive, meaningful pageants and observations on that day to inspire all our citizens to rededicate themselves to the service of their country and to the support and defense of the Constitution.
I also designate the period beginning September 17 and ending September 23, 1969, as Constitution Week; and I urge the people of the United States to observe that week with appropriate ceremonies and activities in their schools and churches, and in other suitable places, to the end that our citizens, whether naturalized or natural-born, may have a better understanding of the Constitution and of the rights and responsibilities of United States citizenship.

Proclamation 3912
PRAYER FOR PEACE, MEMORIAL DAY, 1969
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
On Memorial Day it is customary for Americans to honor the memory of their fellow countrymen who have died in the defense of freedom. Meditating on their sacrifices, we honor not only their memory but also the principles of justice and freedom for which they gave their lives.
Yet honor is not enough. Although we cannot change the pattern of the past, we must do all we can to create a pattern of justice and peace for the future.
The Congress, by a joint resolution of May 11,1950 (64 Stat. 158), has requested the President to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to observe each Memorial Day as a day of prayer for permanent peace and designating a period during such day when the people of the United States might unite in such supplication.
NOW, T H E R E F O K E , I , E I C H A R D N I X O N , President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Memorial Day, Friday, May 30,1969, as a day of prayer for permanent peace, and I designate the hour beginning in each locality at 11 o'clock in the morning of that day as a time to unite in such prayer.
I urge the press, radio, television, and all other information media to cooperate in this observance.
I urge also that on this consecrated day, all the people of America offer their prayers to the Almighty to make reason and good will prevail so that peace can once again bless our nation.
As a special mark of respect for those Americans who have given their lives in the tragic struggle in Vietnam, I direct that the flag of the United States be flown at half-staff all day on Memorial Day, instead of during the customary forenoon period, on all buildings, grounds, and naval vessels of the Federal Government throughout the United States and all areas under its jurisdiction and control.
I also request the Governors of the States and of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the appropriate officials of all local units of government to direct that the flag be flown at half-staff on all public buildings during that entire day, and request the people of the United States to display the flag at half-staff from their homes for the same period.

WHITE CANE SAFETY DAY, 1969

By the President of the United States of America

May 20, 1969

A Proclamation

That blindness is a tragedy is known to all men. That courage and determination can help the blind to transcend that tragedy is not nearly as well known.

A symbol of the blind person's determination to help himself and to live a normal life is the white cane. More than a travelmg aid for blind people, the familiar white cane has become--^to those who can see--a reminder of the tremendous strides which have been made by the blind in adjusting to the world of sight.

A blind man or woman using a white cane can travel with greater confidence and safety on the Nation's streets. This confidence is reflected in other activities, such as education and employment, where the blind can make needed and highly valued contributions. Thus, the white cane helps the blind person to help himself by increasing the range of his activities.

To make our citizens more fully aware of the significance of the white cane, and of the need for motorists to exercise caution and courtesy when approaching its bearer, the Congress, by a joint resolution, approved October 6, 1964 (78 Stat. 1003), has authorized the President to issue annually a proclamation designating October 15 as White Cane Safety Day.

36 u s e 169d.

NOW, T H E E E F O E E , I , R I C H A R D N I X O N , President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim October 15, 1969, as White Cane Safety Day.

I urge all Americans to observe this day by increasing their understanding of the problems of the blind, learning more about the accomplishments of the blind, and seeking ways in which the blind may add even more than they already have to their own personal fulfillment and to the progress of our Nation.

IN W I T N E S S W H E R E O F , I have hereunto set my hand this 20th day of May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-third.

PROCLAMATION 3915-MAY 31, 1969

the released genius of Helen Keller united to penetrate those barriers and produce a person who symbolized the vast potential resource of severely handicapped human beings. Miss Keller became an American ambassador-at-large to the world because she was unexcelled in interpreting the Nation's philosophy of respect for the unique inherent qualities of each individual.
Her recognition of this philosophy was never more eloquently expressed than when she said: "What I am, my country has made me. She has fostered the spirit which has made my education possible." At the same time, Helen Keller was deeply aware that she was miraculously fortunate to have been discovered by persons who were able to give her the priceless gift of language, which was what she needed to light up her extraordinary mind.
As the years passed. Miss Keller became increasingly concerned with those persons who were deprived of sight and hearing. Her later years were dedicated almost entirely to providing the deaf-blind with the kind of opportunities which had yielded such great benefit for her.
I t is, therefore, fitting that we designate, as a memorial to Helen Keller, one week during which w^e may give special thought to the needs of our countrymen who are handicapped by the loss of sight and hearing. The minds of these people are forever imprisoned unless we muster every available resource to reach and rehabilitate them. Attaining this goal requires not only the use of such special techniques as lip reading, manual alphabet, and braille materials but the concern and commitment of all of us to let these people know they are a vital part of our society.
NOW, T H E R E F O E E , I , R I C H A E D N I X O N , President of the United States of America, in consonance with Senate Joint Resolution 99^ ^Q hereby designate the week beginning June 1, 1969, as Helen Keller Memorial Week.
I invite appropriate officers of the Federal, State, and local governments, the heads of voluntary and private groups, and all Americans everywhere to join in this observance. I urge them to find suitable means for expressing determination to cultivate a public understanding and sentiment in behalf of deaf-blind people and to devise a dynamic pattern for continuing their education, welfare and rehabilitation.
IN W I T N E S S W H E R E O F , I have hereunto set my hand this 29th day of May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred sixty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-third.

Proclamation 3916
FLAG DAY AND NATIONAL FLAG WEEK, 1969
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
I t has become customary when referring to the flag of the United States of America to concentrate on what it represents. Every American has pledged allegiance to the flag "and to the Eepublic for which it stands." From time to time, liowever, it is necessary to remind ourselves not only of what the flag stands for but of what it is.
Our flag is a fragile but infinitely strong piece of cloth. What that piece of cloth stands for we all know. What we sometimes forget, however, is that it is precisely because those things which the flag represents are intangible that we need a flag at all. A flag is meant to be seen. Only when it is displayed does it stir us. Our ideals we can honor with our words and deeds; our flag must be honored by an essentially spiritual reaction to a visual stimulus.
On June 14, 1777, the Congress delineated the present form of the flag. These men gave it form; we give it life by displaying it, honoring it, and meditating on those qualities and attributes it so beautifully and proudly symbolizes.
I n commemoration of the adoption of our flag, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved August 3, 1949 (63 Stat. 492), designated June 14 of each year as Flag Day and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation calling for its observance; by a joint resolution approved June 9, 1966 (80 Stat. 194), the Congress has requested the President to issue annually a proclamation designating the week in w^hich June 14 occurs as National Flag Week and calling upon all citizens to display the flag of the United States on those days.
NOW, T H E E E F O E E , I, E I C H A E D N I X O N , President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning J u n e 8, 1969, as National Flag Week, and I direct the appropriate

PROFESSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHY WEEK IN AMERICA
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Photography is one of the most versatile tools in the service of mankind.
I n addition to photography's traditional role of memorializing the lives, the work, and the culture of our people, it plays an important part in education, industry, commerce, and the sciences.
More than 150,000 men and women are engaged in this profession, contributing over a billion dollars to our economy.
But photography is more than a pleasurable hobby or a commercial medium; it is a universal language which demonstrates that people throughout the world share many of the same problems and the same aspirations. As a means of communication, it makes a substantial contribution to world understanding and progress.
As a tribute to the importance of professional photography in American life, the Congress, by Senate Joint Kesolution 77, has requested the President to issue a proclamation designating the period beginning June 8, 1969, and ending June 14, 1969, as Professional Photography Week in America.
NOW, T H E K E F O K E , I, K I C H A R D N I X O N , President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week of June 8 through June 14,1969, as Professional Photography Week in America; and I call upon the people of the United States and interested groups and organizations to observe that week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.

NATIONAL DAY OF PARTICIPATION
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Apollo 11 is on its way to the moon. It carries three brave astronauts ; it also carries the hopes and prayers of hundreds of millions of people here on earth, for whom that first footfall on the moon will be a moment of transcendent drama. Never before has man embarked on so epic an adventure.
In the words of the plaque the Apollo astronauts expect to leave on the moon, they go "in peace for all mankind." The adventure is not theirs alone, but everyone's; the history they are making is not only scientific history, but human history. That moment when man first sets foot on a body other than earth will stand through the centuries as one supreme in human experience, and profound in its meaning for generations to come.
In past ages, exploration was a lonely enterprise. But today, the miracles of space travel are matched by miracles of space communication; even across the vast lunar distance, television brings the moment of discovery into our homes, and makes all of us participants.
As the astronauts go where man has never gone; as they attempt what man has never tried, we on earth will want, as one people, to be

All executive departments, independent establishments, and other governmental agencies, including their field services, shall be closed on the National Day of Participation, and all of their employees (except employees of the Department of State, the Department of Defense, or other agencies who in the judgment of their agency heads should be at their posts of duty for national security or other public reasons), shall be excused from duty on that day. And I direct that the flag of the United States be displayed on all public buildings on that day.
I urge the Governors of the States, the mayors of cities, the heads of school systems, and other public officials to take similar action. I also urge private employers to make appropriate arrangements so that as many of our citizens as possible will be able to share in the significant events of that day. And, finally, I call upon all of our people, on that historic day, to join in prayer for the successful conclusion of Apollo l l ' s mission and the safe return of its crew.

FIRE PREVENTION WEEK, 1969

By jhe President of Hie United States of America

A Proclamation

In an era when technological advancement has brought to our Nation an almost unbelievable array of conveniences and comforts, we still are plagued by the hazard of man's oldest implement for selfpreservation--fire. The potential dangers associated with fire still present a real threat to human life and property.

The present level of our annual fire losses--more than 12,000 lives and over $2 billion in property--is a measure of our failure to heed fire hazards and to correct them. I t is essential that every citizen recognize that such losses can be avoided, but only by personal involvement, determination, and a realization that fires need not occur.

Archery, which in centuries past was a major means of livelihood and warfare, today is one of the fastest growing forms of competitive ;port and recreational activity in the United States.
The skills of the bow and arrow are taught in thousands of school physical education programs; archery rapidly is becoming a major intercollegiate sport; and the manufacture of archery equipment is a significant industry.
In 1972 archery will become an official Olympic sport, which is further evidence of its growing popularity and increased stature.
To give recognition to the development of archery as a major sport and to the role of the United States as host to the world archery championships this year, the Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 85, has requested the President to proclaim the period from August 26, 1969, through September 1, 1969, as National Archery Week.

A Proclamation
Americans today own more than 80 million passenger cars and drive each of them an average of 9,600 miles a year--or three times the distance from Portland, Maine, to San Diego, California. This is a measure of the personal mobility we now enjoy through highway transportation, one of the major elements in our transportation system.
It is a mobility that opens new horizons in emj)loyment opportunity, in choice of residence, and in educational, religious, political, recreational, and other social activities.
Highway transportation has developed from a vast private investment in motor vehicles and a vast puolic investment in highway facilities. These facilities, in turn, are to a large extent, the product of a unique Federal-State partnership in road building.
In 1956 we called upon this partnership to build a new network of super-roads, the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways. Now two-thirds completed, the Interstate System already is providing the public with the benefits of safer, faster, and more economical highway transportation.
To assure the best use of the public investment in highways, all Americans must give special attention to improving the safety and efficiency of highway transportation.
NOW, THEKEFOKE, I, KICHAKD NIXON, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning September 21, 1969, as National Highway Week, and I urge Federal, State, and local officials, as well as highway industry and other organizations, to hold appropriate ceremonies during that week in recognition of what highway transportation means to our Nation.

Governments are rightfully concerned about the economic and social progress of people, but much can be done on a private and

voluntary basis to supplement government plans and actions. Public programs, embodied in just laws at the local, national, and international levels, can advance the improvement of social and economic conditions in every community and country. Voluntary cooperation of private individuals and groups can help to bring about research, new proposals, and citizen participation which will provide essential public support for enactment of just and needed laws.
The concern and participation of the legal, professional, academic, commercial, and other sectors of the private community in the attack on the root problems of discontent--such as poverty, ignorance, and disease--are vital to the national and international welfare. Fundamentally, it is the human misery and unrest under these conditions which most directly affect man's ability to develop a peaceful and orderly world community. It is essential, therefore, that the public and private sectors of every community join together in cooperative endeavors to develop plans and programs to resolve basic social and economic needs within a framework of law on a local, national, and international basis.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, RICHARD NIXON, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim September 8, 1969, as World Law Day in the United States. I call upon public officials and private leaders, members of the legal profession, public and private organizations, and all men of goodwill to arrange public ceremonies on World Law Day in courts, schools, universities, and other public plsices in order that we may rededicate ourselves to the observance of international law and to the goals of social and economic progress, so essential to the preservation of world peace.

The realization of this unity has been at the heart of the United Nations since its creation twenty-four years ago. The United Nations has long realized that the world abounds with problems which call for a cooperative international approach: problems of conflict and war and the keeping of peace in troubled areas; the settlements of disputes by peaceful methods; the control and reduction of nuclear and other weapons, and many other problems ranging from hunger to the sharing of the manifold benefits of science and technology.
Yet the history of the last twenty-four years tells us that the realization of mankind's unity is not enough; men must constantly strive to see to it that in international practice, as well as physical fact, mankind realizes its unity.

GENERAL PULASKI'S MEMORIAL DAY, 1969

By the President of the United States of America

Septembers. i969

A Proclamation

One hundred and ninety years ago, a young Polish patriot in exile gave his life in the cause of American freedom and independence.

Count Casimir Pulaski came to America and joined the Continental Army. He fought with great valor and was promoted by the Congress to the rank of brigadier general in recognition of his military leadership at the Battle of Brandy wine. H e raised and commanded a cavalry unit which won fame as the Pulaski Legion.

On October 11, 1779, General Pulaski died of wounds received two days earlier while leading a cavalry charge in the Battle of Savannah.

I t is fitting that on the anniversary of his death we pay grateful tribute to this gallant Pole, and to the millions of his countrymen in America who have contributed to this nation's growth and to the defense of its freedoms.

NOW, T H E E E F O R E , I, R I C H A R D N I X O N , President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Saturday, October 11, 1969, as General Pulaski's Memorial Day; and I direct the appropriate Government officials to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on that day.

I also invite the people of the United States to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies in honor of the memory of General Pulaski and his dedication to the defense of liberty.

A Proclamation

During the past three decades, this Nation has made great progress in helping handicapped Americans find work. Seven million men and women have overcome disabilities and found a place for themselves in industry, commerce, and the professions.

As favorable as are the statistics documenting this achievement, there are still many handicapped persons in need of rehabilitation. Programs are needed which will continue and expand the work which has already been done.

Yet even the best programs are not enough if they are not matched by a growth of understanding on the part of employers and the public at large. Misconceptions concerning disability must be supplanted by facts.
We must help the physically handicapped not only because it enables them to build better lives, but also because an American who is employed despite his handicap can help to build a better nation for all of us.
NOW, T H E E E F O K E , I , R I C H A E D N I X O N , President of the United States of America, in accordance with the joint resolution of Congress approved August 11,1945 (59 Stat. 530), designating the first full week of October of each year as National Employ the Physically Handicapped Week, do hereby call upon the people of our Nation to observe the week beginning October 5, 1969, for such purpose.

During that week I urge all the Governors of States, mayors of cities, and other public officials, as well as leaders of industry, educational and religious groups, labor, civic, veterans', agricultural, women's, scientific, professional, and fraternal organizations, and all other interested organizations and individuals, including the handicapped themselves, to participate in this observance.

On October 12 we again celebrate in honor of the great sea captain and explorer whose historic westward voyage across the Atlantic led to the permanent settlement of America.

Kespect for the achievement of Christopher Columbus is especially appropriate this year when we have witnessed an epic journey of discovery, the journey to the moon. Both the voyages of Columbus and those of our modern astronauts are expressions of man's great ambition to confront the unknown, and to master the challenges of distance and space.

We remember also that Columbus was a man of Italy, a noble example for the many other men of Italy who have come to our country and to so many other lands of the new world. Sailing in the service of the Spanish crown, which had the vision to support his courage and initiative, Christopher Columbus opened America for all the people of the world.
In tribute to the memory of Columbus, the Congress of the United States, by a joint resolution approved April 30, 1934 (48 Stat. 657), requested the President to proclaim October 12 of each year as Columbus Day for the observance of the anniversary of the discovery of America.

NATIONAL HISPANIC HERITAGE WEEK, 1969 gy j^ President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

One of America's great strengths is her diversity. A wide variety of peoples have made contributions to our nation; each has added its own strength and charm to American life, and each provides an ongoing link between our culture and those of other countries around the world.

The Hispanic culture is one to which this nation is particularly indebted. Men of Hispanic origin were among the first Europeans to explore this hemisphere. For four centuries men and women of Hispanic descent have provided distinguished leadership in our country and in other New World countries, both in government and in other walks of life.

Today the people of the United States are reminded of this rich heritage in many ways. Millions of our citizens speak Spanish, and Hispanic names and traditions grace many parts of our landscape, including both the town where I was born and the place where I am making my new home.

36 use \tti

This country's Hispanic heritage is particularly important because it reminds us of the great traditions we share with our neighbors in Latin America. I n fact, when the Congress, just a ;^ear a^o, requested the President to issue annually a proclamation setting aside one week ^ Hispanic Heritage Week, it designated the week which includes the dates of September 15th and 16th, when five Central American nations and the Republic of Mexico celebrate their Independence Days.

The Hispanic culture is one of depth, excitement, and beauty. I t has crossed borders and mountains and oceans, and has made its influence felt in all parts of the globe. I n honoring it, we give strength to that international understanding which is indispensable to world order.

NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I , R I C H A R D N I X O N , President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning September 14,1969, as National Hispanic Heritage Week.

STAY IN SCHOOL By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation
As the summer ends, many young Americans are deciding whether to continue their formal education. For economic and personal reasons some will be tempted to drop out.
Most of those who abandon their classrooms will be forced to contest for jobs with others who possess better educational credentials. Without an opportunity to acquire relevant experience, they may be continually unable to obtain positions offering prospects for advancement.
Experience has proven that citizens sufficiently concerned to provide potential dropouts with encouragement and counseling can play a decisive role in persuading them to continue their education. The course of thousands of lives can be constructively influenced by this kind of individual action.
Parents, teachers, religious advisors, and friends can all contribute to the national welfare by urging young people to stay in school. Private and public employers can help by providing part-time jobs to those for whom the need to have income is critical.
To secure wide public participation in an effort to limit the number of youths who drop out of school, I, K I C H A K D N I X O N , President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim a national Stayin-School campaign.

NATIONAL FARM-CITY WEEK, 1969

-

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

As our society becomes more complex, it also grows more interdependent. The behavior of each individual has a direct impact on the lives of others. What happens in one area of the country affects events in other areas. Occurrences in every walk of life and every section of society are inextricably intertwined.

One significant example of such interconnections can be found in the interdependence of urban and rural America. I t is important that the people of our country come to understand that interdependence more fully than we do at present.

It is not well known for instance that agriculture serves as a $50 billion customer to our economy. The marketing and processing of food and fiber provide almost 5 million non-farm jobs and a $25 billion annual payroll. At the same time, technological changes on the farm have so increased agricultural efficiency that record production has been achieved by fewer people. Many rural residents have therefore migrated to the cities. While some have become productive contributors to urban society, many others have been unable to find new economic roles.
The relationshii) between urban and rural America will never be constant--but it will always be important. It will always require close examination and careful rethinking. It is to that end that I, RICHARD NIXON, President of the United States of America do hereby designate the week of November 21 through November 27,

83 STAT. ] PROCLAMATION 3934-SEPT. 17, 1969

1969, as National Farm-City Week. I call upon all Americans to participate in this observance.
I particularly ur^e the Department of Agriculture, the land-grant colleges and universities, the Cooperative Extension Service, and other appropriate organizations to carry out programs to mark this occasion, including public meetings and exhibits, and presentations in newspapers and in magazines, on radio and on television.
I urge that such programs emphasize:
--the development of better understanding and more effective working relationships between those who live on the farm and those who live in non-farm areas;
--the enormous scientific and technological advances in agriculture and their significance for the lives of both rural and urban dwellers;
--the vital need to plan more effectively the way we will use our land, conserve our natural resources, and protect the quality of our environment;
--^the importance of maintaining and enhancing the social and economic health of farms and rural communities;
--^the urgency of providing opportunities for disadvantaged people in both rural and urban areas to participate more fully in the economic life of the nation.

When Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben joined Washington at Valley Forge, he was among the first of more than eight million Germans who came to our shores in search of liberty.

AMERICAN EDUCATION WEEK, 1969

September24,1969

gy the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

There are times in the lives of men and in the lives of institutions when basic questions must be asked. Such a time has come for the institution of which many Americans have been most proud: our system of education.

We have reached a point at which we must take a close, long, hard look at what is good and what is bad about our schools, at what should be strengthened and what should be eliminated.

Yet even as we make such an examination we must all agree on one basic principle: we must not allow our schools to be captured by violence or dominated by ideological dogmatists. Our schools are not perfect, but this lack of perfection is no excuse for lawbreaking or a lack of civility and decency on the part of any critic, no matter how deeply he feels or how little he thinks.

Those of us who have attended public, private and religiously affiliated schools and colleges realize that no single act can ever repay the institutions and the men and women who serve them for what they did for us. The overwhelming majority of students today feels the same way. A good education is a form of rebirth, a way toward economic and intellectual achievement, an affirmation that an individual human being's thoughts are important, that his emotions can find creative direction, that he is a man and not a thing.

This is what education can do at its best. This is what all Americans, young and old, black and white, must preserve, expand and protect.

Therefore, I, R I C H A R D N I X O N , President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the period of November 9 through November 15, 1969, as American Education Week.

I urge all Americans to join with me during this week in a thoughtful examination of our education system and in formulating ways in which education in America can be improved where needed, by the traditional American way of reason and open discussion.

IN W I T N E S S W H E R E O F , I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred sixty-nine and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-fourth.

VETERANS DAY, 1969 By the President of the United States of America

September 24. i969

A Proclamation
From Valley Forge to Vietnam, American servicemen have responded to their nation's call to duty.
That call has often led to loneliness, hardship, danger--and, for some, death. In response to that call, American servicemen have acted with unsurpassed valor and devotion and have demonstrated to enemies, of freedom all over the world that free men and women will defend the principles of a free society.
After each war or conflict, these dedicated Americans who performed so valiantly as servicemen have returned to build a stronger country. Today there are approximately 27 million American veterans. Their contribution to our nation, in war and peace, has been invaluable.
To acknowledge the respect and admiration we have for our veterans, the Congress has designated November 11 to be a legal holiday and to be known as Veterans Day, and has dedicated it to the cause of world peace (Act of May 13,1938, 52 Stat. 351, as amended (5 U.S.C. 6103)).
NOW, T H E R E F O K E , I, R I C H A R D N I X O N , President of the United States of America, urge the people of this nation to join in commemorating Tuesday, November 11, 1969, as Veterans Day with suitable observances.

farmers, merchants, politicians--their backgrounds were as different as their love of liberty was unanimous. What is perhaps even more significant than the differences in their backgrounds was the differences in their ages: three were under thirty, twenty were under forty, seven were sixty or older. The committee assigned to draft the Declaration included one of the youngest--Thomas Jefferson--and the oldest--Benjamin Franklin.
These brave men did not hold that only those in a certain age group were gifted enough to join their struggle. Each man was judged not on how old he was but on how strongly he was committed to liberty. These men debated and questioned each other as equals, because each shared the love of freedom that knows no boundary of age.
The spirit of the signers of the Declaration of Independence is needed in our nation more than ever before. Young and old, we are all Americans, and if we are to remain free we must talk to each other, listen to each other, young and old alike, in the interest of freedom.
To encourage and stimulate better communication between our citizens of different generations, the Congress by House Joint Resolution 614, has requested the President to proclaim the period from September 28, 1969, through October 4, 1969, as National Adult-Youth Communications Week.

In recognition of the necessity for protecting and developing the health of the Nation's children, the Congress, by a joint resolution of May 18,1928, as amended (36 U.S.C. 143), requested the President to issue annually a proclamation setting apart the first Monday in October of each year as Child Health Day.

NATIONAL SCHOOL LUNCH WEEK, 1969

By the President of the United States of America

October 3. i969

A Proclamation

Our land has been blessed by an abundance of food and by the genius and industry of our food-producers. Yet, despite the rich and varied diet available to us, there are still many Americans who are malnourished, whether due to poverty or to uninformed purchase and preparation of food.
It is one of the major tasks confronting the American people to eliminate malnutrition whether it be caused by the curse of poverty or the blight of ignorance.
A vital step toward this goal is the provision of ample food and proper nutrition for the American child. Safeguarding the health and well-being of school children has been a hallmark of the National School Lunch Program during its 23 years of operation. Last year it provided nutritious lunches to more than 20 million youngsters, including some three million from low-income families who were served at no cost or at a greatly reduced price.
It is unfortunate that many thousands of children seriously in need of better nutrition do not now have the benefit of either the school lunch or school breakfast service. All of us--professional and volunteer workers alike--at Federal, State and local levels must use our

abilities and resources in an effort to bring better nutrition to these children. There can be no more important or far-reaching use of the abundance of food produced by America's farmlands than to feed our children.
To recognize the value and achievements of the National School Lunch Program, the Congress, by a joint resolution of October 9,1962 ^7g Stat. 779), has designated the seven-day period beginning on the second Sunday of October in each year as National School Lunch Week, and has requested the President to issue a proclamation annually calling for the observance of that week.

NATIONAL DAY OF PRAYER, 1969
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
John Adams was the first President to live in the executive residence we call the White House. His first night there, he wrote a letter to his wife, Abigail, in which he said: "Before I end my letter, I pray Heaven to bestow the best of blessings on this house and all that shall hereafter inhabit it. May none but wise and honest men ever rule under this roof."
This is a brief, unadorned prayer. Yet its very simplicity speaks to us today, across the years that separate the time of Adams from our own. Prayer knows no boundary of time; we in America today, in the spirit of Adams, seek the blessing of God on our nation and its leaders.
At a time in our nation's history when the power of prayer is needed more than ever, it is fitting that we publicly demonstrate our faith in the power of prayer.
Sensible of our people's faith, the Congress, by joint resolution of April 17, 1952, provided that the President "shall set aside and proclaim a suitable day each year, other than a Sunday, as a National Day of Prayer, on which the people of the United States may turn to God in prayer and meditation at churches, in groups, and as individuals."
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I , R I C H A R D N I X O N , President of the United States of America, do hereby set aside Wednesday, October 22, as National Day of Prayer, 1969.

Proclamation 3941
NATIONAL FAMILY HEALTH WEEK
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
The American medical profession has made remarkable progress in the advancement of health. Constant expansion of medical knowledge, development of new, more and better hospitals and health facilities, growth of programs to assure access to health services to people who might otherwise lack them--all have combined to keep us moving toward the goal of higher standards for all our people.
Life expectancy has been increasing. Infant mortality rates have been declming slowly, as have maternal mortality rates. One after another, contagious diseases have been conquered.
But these overall gains cannot mask the critically serious problems that remain. Heart disease, cancer, and stroke account for two-thirds of all deaths in the United States. Too many mothers and young babies do not receive life-saving care. Thousands of Americans are not able to work because of chronic disabling diseases that might have been prevented. Many Americans are still without adequate health care. Efforts to improve health services must be and will be intensified.
Amid all of the large scale advances and the remaining problems, the family physician continues to perform a unique service to the nation in helping to guard health and prevent disease. His dedication and skill are the foundation of good medical care. His work embraces the broad spectrum of medical science--from personal health to family planning to emotional well-being.
To focus national attention on the accomplishments of the American health care system and the central role of the family physician in maintaining superior medical services and improving the health of Americans of all ages and in all walks of life, the Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 46, has requested the President to issue a proclamation designating the week of November 16 to 22, 1969, as National Family Health Week.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I , R I C H A R D N I X O N , President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning November 16,1969, as National Family Health Week. I call upon the people of the United States, the medical and health professions, and other interested organizations and groups to observe that week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN W I T N E S S W H E R E O F , I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-fourth.

Proclamation 3942
NATIONAL INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE WEEK
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
The protection and conservation of the health of our workers in all types of industry is of paramount importance in the highly industrialized society of the United States.
Through the concerted efforts of scientists, engineers, and research organizations, our industry has made great progress in solving many industrial health problems--in relation to air qualitjr, noise abatement, mental health and the whole field of industrial hygiene.
In recognition of the progress already made in preserving the health of our industrial workers, and in recognition of those individuals and organizations who are seeking new ways to protect and improve the health of the nation's work force through the coordinated scientific measures and the technological and engineering controls which characterize industrial hygiene, the Congress by Senate Joint Resolution 150 has requested the President to proclaim the period beginning October 12, 1969, and ending October 18, 1969, as "National Industrial Hygiene Week."
NOW, THEREFORE, I, RICHARD NIXON, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the period beginning October 12,1969, and ending October 18,1969, as National Industrie Hygiene Week.
I call upon the people of the United States, and interested groups and organizations, particularly those in industry, to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred siirty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-fourth.

Proclamation 3943
DAY OF BREAD AND HARVEST FESTIVAL
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Bread has come to symbolize food--and even life itself--for the American people. More than a food, it is an ancient and universal part of man's daily life. In a time of harvest, the symbol of bread reminds all Americans of the blessings and bounty of our land.
As a token of man's gratitude for the bounty of nature and the annual harvest of farm and field, and in recognition of bread as a symbol of all foods, the Congress by House Joint Resolution 851 has requested the President to proclaim Tuesdaj^, the 28th of October, 1969, as a "Day of Bread" as a part of international observances, and the last week of October within which it falls as a period of "Harvest Festival."

Proclamation 3944

THANKSGIVING DAY, 1969

By the President of the United States of America

November 12, 1969

A Proclamation

On October 3,1863, President Abraham Lincoln invited his fellow citizens to "set apart and observe the last Thursday of November next as a day of Thanksgiving. . . ." This was the year of the battle of Gettysburg and of other major battles between Americans on American soil. To many, this call for a national day of Thanksgiving must have seemed strange, coming as it did at a time of war and bitterness.

Yet Lincoln knew that the act of thanksgiving should not be limited to times of peace and serenity. H e knew that it is precisely at those times of hardship when men most need to recognize that the Source of all good constantly bestows His blessings on mankind.

Today, despite our material wealth and well-being, Americans face complex problems unknown before in our nation's history. In giving thanks today, we express gratitude for past bounty and we also confidently face the challenges confronting our own nation and the world because we know we can rely on a strength greater than ourselves.

This year, let us especially seek to rekindle in our respective hearts and minds the spirit of our first settlers who valued freedom above all else, and who found much for which to be thankful when material comforts were meager. We are, indeed, a most fortunate people.

NOW, T H E E E F O E E , I , E I C H A E D N I X O N , President of the United States of America, in consonance with Section 6103 of Title 5 of the United States Code d e s i ^ a t i n g the fourth Thursday of November in each year as Thanksgiving Day, do hereby proclaim Thursday, November 27, 1969, as a day of national thanksgiving.

W H E E E A S such section 5(a) (2) has been repealed by Public Law 91-124 of November 26,1969:

That a random selection sequence will be established by a drawing to be conducted in Washington, D.C., on December 1, 1969, and wiU be applied nationwide. The random selection method will use 366 days to represent the birthdays (month and day only) of all registrants who, prior to January 1,1970, shall have attained their nineteenth year of age but not their twenty-sixth. The drawing, commencing with the first day selected and continuing until all 366 days are drawn, shall be accomplished impartially.

On the day designated above, a supplemental drawing or drawings will be conducted to determine alphabetically the random selection sequence by name among registrants who have the same birthday.

The random selection sequence obtained as described above shall determine the order of selection of registrants who prior to January 1, 1970, shall have attained their nineteenth year of age but not their twenty-sixth and who are not volunteers and not delinquents. New random selection sequences shall be established, in a similar manner, for registrants who attain their nineteenth year of age on or after January 1,1970.

BILL OF RrGHTS DAY

HUMAN RIGHTS DAY

By the President of the United States of America

December 9, 1969

A Proclamation

One hundred seventy-eight years ago, the Bill of Rights was ratified and incorporated as part of the United States Constitution. The founders of our Republic had fought for individual liberty and for representative and responsible government. I n the first ten amendments to the Constitution they sought to ensure that the power of the government would not abridge the rights of citizens.

u s e prec. title 1.

More than twenty years ago, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The founders of the United Nations had endured a world war brought on by those who denied the rights of men to equality and justice and who abrogated the rights of nations to exist in peace.

The two documents--the Bill of Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights--are close in spirit although widely separated in time. The Bill of Rights is the law of the land. The Universal Declaration is a statement of principles, of common standards of achievement for all peoples and all nations. We in the United States are engaged in unremitting efforts to give real meaning to these standards for every American, to assure to every person the full enjoyment of his basic rights.

NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, R I C H A R D N I X O N , President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim December 10, 1969, as Human Rights Day and December 15,1969, as Bill of Rights Day, and call upon the people of the United States of America to observe the week of December 10-17, 1969, as Human Rights Week, to the end that we may rededicate ourselves as a united people to the task of assuring to every person--regardless of his race, sex, creed, color, or place of national origin--the full enjoyment of his basic human rights. Let us act so as to provide an example that wall point the way in the struggle to promote respect for human rights throughout the world.

I N W I T N E S S W H E R E O F , I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of December, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred sixty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-fourth.

WRIGHT BROTHERS DAY, 1969

By the President of the United States of America

December ii,i969

A Proclamation

Over the centuries, man dreamed a great dream--to break his bondage to the earth and fly through the sky. The Greeks told of Icarus who almost succeeded, but who paid for failure with his life. The dream took shape in the mind of the Renaissance Man, da Vinci, who

974

PROCLAMATION 3948-DEC. 12, 1969

[83 STAT.

drew designs for a flying machine, but who never flew. But the dream was always there, and always man worked to make the dream a reality.
On December 17,1903, Orville and Wilbur Wright made the dream a hard scientific fact. Orville stepped from a homemade contraption onto an ocean beach in the State of North Carolina, after completing the first successful airplane flight.
Almost sixty-six years later, another man stepped from another craft onto another plain. This plain was the waterless Sea of Tranquility on the Moon. Man had not only removed his bondage to the earth, but had expanded his horizons to outer space.
During these sixty-six years since the Wright brothers made man's first powered flight, aviation has revolutionized our way of life. Today, aviation is the servant of man, bringing the world closer together and making its parts more accessible. Tomorrow, aviation promises greater service, greater contributions, and new vistas for each of us.
The names of Orville Wright and Wilbur Wright symbolize America's pioneering leadership in aviation. With countless other men of all nations, they represent mankind's ceaseless effort to make dreams reality.
I t is fitting that we should commemorate the achievements of the Wright brothers. The Congress, by Public Law 88-209 (77 Stat. 402), has designated the seventeenth day of December of each year as Wright Brothers Day and has requested the President to issue annually a proclamation inviting the people of the United States to observe that day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
NOW, T H E E E F O K E , I, R I C H A E D N I X O N , President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon the people of this nation, and their local and national government officials, to observe Wright Brothers Day, December 17,1969, with appropriate ceremonies and activities, both to recall the accomplishments of the Wright brothers, and to provide a stimulus to aviation in this country and throughout the world.
I N W I T N E S S W H E E E O F , I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of December, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred sixty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-fourth.

EXPLANATION
General. The following tables are designed to serve as a guide to prior laws and other Federal instruments which are patently amended, repealed, referred to, or otherwise cited by the textual provisions of the public laws contained in this volume. These tables were initiated as a separate pamphlet to accompany Volume 70 of the United States Statutes at Large. Beginning with Volume 71, they are being published as an integral part of each volume.
From time to time the tables will be cumulated and made separately available as a convenience to users. Tables 1-9 of Volumes 70-79 covering the years 1956 through 1965 have been cumulated and published as a separate pamphlet. Coverage and arrangement of the tables are subject to change with a view to improved usefulness.
The arrangement of the tables is outlined above. There are two basic groups: (1) Tables 1-10 cover amendments, repeals, and other actions directly affecting prior laws and other Federal instruments; and (2) Tables 11-19 cover all citations and other references to prior laws and other Federal instruments.
Details of Arrangement. Tables 1-9 are limited to cases in which prior laws and other Federal instruments are expressly affected.

LAWS AFFECTED IN VOLUME 83

Table 10 is a catch-all table designed as a finding aid to relationships which are expressed in general terms. Listed in this table are all public laws in this volume which contain such provisions as "notwithstanding any other provision of law," and "all laws in conflict with this law are hereby repealed."
Tables 11-19 cover all other cases in which prior laws or other Federal instruments are mentioned in the text of the public laws in this volume, without regard to the purpose underlying such reference.
In each of the basic groups the first and largest table is entitled "General Legislation," and contains listings of all laws affected which have not been codified in the Revised Statutes, the Internal Revenue Codes, the Canal Zone Code, or in those titles of the United States Code or District of Columbia Code which have been enacted into law. Succeeding tables cover these codified provisions, as well as other instruments such as reorganization plans, veterans' regulations, Executive orders and proclamations, and treaties and international agreements. The numbering of the tables in the two groups is parallel. Thus Table 2 and Table 12 both relate to the Revised Statutes; Table 7 and Table 17 both relate to veterans' regulations.
Table 1 is arranged chronologically. In preparing this table the "basic act" principle has been followed. Under this principle the key listing of amendatory legislation will be found under the basic act affected, rather than under intervening amendments thereto. Furthermore, all laws included are treated as if tables covering prior volumes of the United States Statutes at Large were in existence. Thus, no attempt is made to give an historical picture of a law, and only the latest amendment in the chain will be reflected. Occasionally, to promote clarity, cross references have been supplied at key points.
Users of Table 1 should, therefore, look under the date, public law number, or statutes volume and page number of the basic act affected, in order to determine whether changes have been made by the public laws contained in this volume. Although a given section of any act may have been added at a later date, the section is carried under the date and statutes citation of the basic act. For this reason the page numbers in the column headed "Statutes volume and page" are the numbers of the page on which each act begins.
All tables are arranged chronologically, except where the existence of a system of codification makes possible a sequential arrangement from the lowest to the highest title or section number. In Tables 1-10 there is a "Comment" column, in which the nature of the affecting action is described. These are editorial comments, intended to reflect what is patent in the laws reviewed, and every effort has been made to avoid interpretations.
In Tables 11-19 the "Comment" column is unnecessary, since in each instance the comment would be "Cited" or "Referred to." In these tables, moreover, the number of columns has been held to a minimum in the interest of brevity. Thus Table 11 contains only three columns listing the date and number of the law referred to, and the page number in this volume at which the reference may be found.
Caveat.
All the tables are editorially compiled and presented as reference guides only. Hence they have no evidentiary status or legal effect. Indirect or implied relationships are not included. These may be found through use of the Subject Index or through research based on the text itself.
The Office of the Federal Register invites criticisms or suggestions with a view to improving the tables wherever possible.
