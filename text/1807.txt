A doubt concerning the construction of a law, may be a good ground for seizure, and authorize a certificate of probable cause. The United States v. Riddle, 5 Cranch, 311 ; 2 Cond. Rep. 266.
If a collector justify the detention of a vessel under the 11th section of the embargo law of April 25, 1808, he need not show that his opinion was correct, nor that he used reasonable care and diligence in ascertaining the facts upon which his opinion was founded. It is sufficient if he honestly entertained the opinion in which he acted. Otis v. Watkins, 9 Cranch, 339; 3 Cond. Rep. 424.
Where a seizure for a breach of the laws of the United States, is finally adjudged wrongful and without probable cause by the courts, the party may proceed, at his election, by a suit at common law, or in the instance court of the admiralty for the illegal act. But the common law remedy in such cases must be sought in the state courts, the courts of the United States having no jurisdiction to decide on the conduct of their officers in the execution of their laws, in suits at common law, until the case shall have passed through the state courts.

Punishment for falsely making, forging, or counterfeiting notes of the Bank of the U. States.

If a suit be brought against the seizing officer for a supposed trespass in making a seizure of a vessel for a supposed forfeiture, while the suit is depending, the fact of such pendency may be pleaded in abatement, or as a temporary bar to the action; if after a decree of condemnation, then that fact may be pleaded as a bar; if after an acquittal without a certificate of probable cause, then the officer is without any justification for the seizure, and it is definitively settled to be a tortious act. Gelston et al. v. Hoyt, 3 Wheat. 246 ; 4 Cond. Rep. 244.
To justify a seizure there must be probable cause of seizure; and if an officer of the customs seize without probable cause, no indictment lies for resisting him in the seizure, for he is not in the execution of his office. United States v. Gay, 2 Gallis. C. C. R. 359.
Seizures for breach of municipal laws, are made at the peril of the seizers. If made without probable cause, the seizers are liable for all the consequences ; for the act is construed a tortious act, and his diligence for the preservation of the property, is no defence against losses occasioned by the superior force, or inevitable casualty. Burke v. Trevitt, 1 Mason's C. C. R. 96.
(a) Indictment in the circuit court of North Carolina, for the forging of, and an attempt to pass a certain paper writing in imitation of, and purporting to be, a bill or note issued by the president and directors of the Bank of the United States, provided in the 18th section of the act of 1816, establishing the Bank of the United States. The note was signed with the name of " John Huske," who had not been at any time president of the Bank of the United States; but who at the date of the counterfeiting was president of the office of discount at Fayetteville; and was countersigned by the name of "John w" Sanford," who at no time was cashier of the mother Bank, but was at the said date cashier of the said office of discount and deposit. Held, that this was an offence within the provisions of the law. United States v. Turner, 7 Peters, 132.
Indictment on the 18th section of the act of Congress, entitled, "An act to incorporate the Bank of the United States," passed April 15, 1816. The indictment charged the defendant with uttering and forging "a counterfeit bill in imitation of a bill used by the president, &c., of the bank." The forged paper was in these words and figures: " Cashier of the Bank of the United States, pay C. W. Earnest or order, five dollars. Office of discount and deposit in Pittsburg, 10th day of December, 1829. A. Brackenridge, Prqs't, J. Correy, Cash'r." "Pay bearer, C. W. Earnest." Held, that a genuine instrument of which the forged and counterfeited instrument is an imitation, is not a bill issued by order of the president of the Bank of the United States, according to the true intent and meaning of the 18th section of the act incorporating the bank. The United States v. Brewster, 7 Peters, 164.
Counterfeiting an indorsement on a post note of the Bank of the United States, is not an offence under the 18th section of the act incorporating the bank. United States v. Stewart, 4 Wash. C. C. R. 226.
In a prosecution for forging the notes of the Bank of the United States, it is not necessary to prove that it was committed with intention to defraud some corporation or person, and that the notes stated in the indictment, and given in evidence as forged, and those alleged to be forged, are the same.

Chap . XXI.--An Act io extend the time for locating Virginia military [land] warrants, for returning surveys thereon to the office of the Secretary of the department of War, and appropriating lands for the use of schools, in the Virginia military reservation, in lieu of those heretofore appropriated, (a)
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the officers and soldiers

(a) Under the reserve contained in the cession act of Virginia, and under the acts of Congress of August 10, 1790, and of June 9, 1794, the whole country lying between the Sciota and Little Miami rivers, was subjected to military warrants, to satisfy which the reserve was made. Doddridge v. Thompson, 9
Wheat. 469; 5 Cond. Rep. 645. The territory lying between the two rivers, is the whole country from their sources to their mouths ;
and if no branch of either of them has acquired the name exclusively of another, the main branch to its source must be considered the true river. Ibid.
The act of June 26, 1812, to ascertain the western boundary of the tract reserved for military warrants, and which provisionally designates Ludlow's line, as the western boundary, did not invalidate the title to the land between that line and Roberts's line, acquired under a Virginia military warrant previous to the passage of that act. Ibid.
The land between Ludlow's and Roberts's line was not withdrawn from the territory liable to be surveyed for military warrants by any act of Congress passed before the act of June 12, 1812. Ibid.
The reservation made by the law of Virginia of 1783, ceding to Congress the territory northwest of the river Ohio, is not a reservation of the whole tract of country between the rivers Sciota and Little Miami. It is a reservation of only so much as may be necessary to make up any deficiency of good land in the country set apart for the officers and soldiers of the Virginia line on continental establishment, on the southeast side of the Ohio. The residue of the lands are ceded to the United States as a common fund for those states who come or might become members of the Union; to be disposed of for that purpose. Jackson v. Clarke et al., 1 Peters, 635.
Although the military lands constituted the primary claim upon the trust, that claim was according to the intention of the parties so to be satisfied, as still to keep in view the interests of the Union, which were also vital objects of the trust. This was only to be effected by prescribing the time in which the lands to be appropriated by those claimants should be separated from the general mass, so as to enable the government to apply the residue to the general purposes of the trust. Ibid.
If the right existed in Congress to prescribe the time in which military warrants should be located, the right to annex conditions to its extension, follows as a necessary consequence. Ibid.
If it be conceded that the proviso in the act of March 2, 1807, was not intended for the protection of surveys which were in themselves absolutely void, it must be admitted that it was intended to protect

Sec . 3. And be it further enacted, That the clerk of the said circuit court of the district of Columbia, for the county of Washington, shall be entitled to receive the same fees only, for his services, as by the laws of Maryland, in force on the said first Monday of December, in the year eighteen hundred, were allowed to the clerk of the general court of Maryland, for the like services; and for his services in chancery proceedings, the same fees only, as by the said laws, were allowed to the register of the court of chancery of Maryland, for the like services; and for such services as were not, by the said laws, to be performed by the said clerk of the said general court, or by the said register, he shall be allowed such fees and compensation only, as by the said laws, were allowed to a clerk of a county court in Maryland, for the like services: Provided, that nothing in this act shall prevent the said marshal and clerk from receiving their daily compensation for attending court as heretofore.
Sec . 4. And be it further enacted, That such of the said fees as by the laws aforesaid, are chargeable in tobacco, shall be paid in money, at the rate of one dollar and seventy-five cents for one hundred pounds of tobacco. And it shall be the duty of the said marshal, and the said clerk, of the said circuit court, respectively, to make a table of their respective fees, in dollars and cents, according to this act; and to keep a copy thereof, at all times, exposed to public view, in their respective offices; and all fees and costs shall be taxed, and fee bills for collection, stated in money only.
Sec . 5. And be it further enacted, That in suits at common law in the said circuit court, the taxable fee to an attorney, shall be five dollars only; and in suits in chancery, the taxable fee to a solicitor, shall be ten dollars only: Provided, that nothing in this act shall extend to the official services of the attorney of the United States, for the district of Columbia.
Sec . 6. And be it further enacted, That all temporary statutes of the states of Virginia and Maryland, which by the first section of the act concerning the district of Columbia, passed on the twenty-seventh of February, one thousand eight hundred and one, were adopted for the said district, shall not expire within the said district, by virtue of any limitation in said statutes contained; but shall remain in force as at the time of their adoption, unless other provision has been or shall be made by Congress, respecting the same.

of the Virginia line on continental establishment, their heirs or assigns, entitled to bounty lands within the tract reserved by Virginia, between the little Miami and Scioto rivers, for satisfying the legal bounties to her officers and soldiers upon continental establishment, shall be allowed a further time of three years, from the twenty-third of March next, to complete their locations, and a further time of five years from the said twenty-third of March next, to return their surveys and warrants, or certified copies of warrants, to the office of the Secretary of the War department, any thing in the act intituled "An act to ascertain the boundary of the lands reserved by the state of Virginia, northwest of the river Ohio, for the satisfaction of her officers and soldiers on continental establishment, and to limit the period for locating the said lands," to the contrary notwithstanding: Provided, that no locations, as aforesaid, within the above mentioned tract, shall, after the passing of this act, be made on tracts of land for which patents had previously been issued, or which had been previously surveyed, and any patent which may nevertheless be obtained for land located contrary to the provisions of this section, shall be considered as null and void.
Sec . 2. And be it further enacted, That the Secretary of the Treasury be, and he is hereby authorized to obtain copies of all the locations and surveys, which have been, or may be made within the above mentioned tract, and to cause to be run or surveyed, as many straight lines across the same, as he may deem necessary, not exceeding three: and
from these and such other documents as may be obtained, to cause to be made a general connected plat of all the lands located and surveyed within the same; a copy of which shall be deposited in the war department, and another copy shall be laid before Congress, together with an estimate of the surplus which may remain, after satisfying the bounties
above mentioned. And the expenses incurred in surveying the lines, and obtaining the copies aforesaid, and in preparing the general plat
above mentioned, shall be defrayed out of the monies appropriated for completing the surveys of the public lands northwest of the river Ohio.

Lands surveyed are as completely withdrawn from the common mass, as lands patented. It cannot be said that the prohibition that "no location shall be made on tracts of land for which patents have previously been issued, or which had been previously surveyed," was intended only for valid and regular surveys. They did not require legislative aid. The clause was introduced for the protection of defective entries and surveys, which might be made in quiet times. Ibid.
Under the peculiar system of the Virginia land law, as it has been settled in Kentucky and the military district in Ohio, by usages adapted to the circumstances of the country, many principles are established, which are unknown to the common law. A long course of adjudication has fixed these principles, and they are considered as the settled rules by which these military titles are to be governed. Galt v. Galloway, 4 Peters, 343.

Where a vessel had been driven by stress of weather into a port, in the West Indies, while proceeding to Portland in Maine, and there detained by the government of the place, this was such a casualty as came within the exception of " dangers of the seas," in the condition of an embargo bond, dated 29th December, 1807, taken in pursuance of the act of Congress of December 22, 1807. United States v. Hall and Worth, 6 Cranch, 176 ; 2 Cond. Rep. 340.
Subsequent to the execution of this bond, on the 9th of January, 1808, Congress passed a supplement to the embargo law, by which other and additional penalties were imposed, and the circumstances under which the obligor in any embargo bond given under the act of 22d December, 1807, could obtain relief, were changed. The court said they would never consider the latter act as applying to previous facts, unless such construction should be unavoidable. Ibid.
In an action of debt for the penalty of an embargo bond, it is a good plea under the act of Congress of 12th March, 1808, sec. 3, that the party was prevented relanding the goods in the United States by unavoidable accidents. Durousseau v. The United States, 6 Cranch, 307; 2 Cond. Rep. 380.
It was no offence under the embargo laws, to take goods out of one vessel and put them in another in the port of Baltimore ; unless it was with an intention to export them. 6 Cranch, 327.
The evidence of the necessity which will excuse a violation of the embargo laws, must be clear and certain. Brig James Wells v. The United States, 7 Cranch, 22 ; 2 Cond. Rep. 402.
The departure of a vessel from a wharf in a port, and proceeding a mile and an half therefrom, with the intention of proceeding to sea, is not a departure from the port within the meaning of the supplementary embargo act of January 9, 1808, if the vessel had not actually gone out of the port before seizure.

Foreign ves-

hereby is laid on all ships and vessels in the ports and places within the
limits or jurisdiction of the United States, cleared or not cleared, bound to any foreign port or place; and that no clearance be furnished to any ship or vessel bound to such foreign port or place, except vessels under the immediate direction of the President of the United States : and that the President be authorized to give such instructions to the officers of the revenue, and of the navy and revenue cutters of the United States, as shall appear best adapted for carrying the same into full effect: Provided, that nothing herein contained shall be construed to prevent the departure of any foreign ship or vessel, either in ballast, or with the goods, wares and merchandise on board of such foreign ship or vessel, when notified of this act.

liable to be seized on her return, although that act gives a penalty of double her value, in case she should not be seized. United States v. The brig Eliza, 7 Cranch, 113 ; 2 Cond. Rep. 437.
A merchant vessel captured as prize, condemned and sold, and afterwards purchased by her former master, a citizen of the United States, who obtained a Danish burgher's brief, and who cleared out of a port of the United States as a Dane, is a foreign ship within the fifth section of the act of January 9, 1808, supplementary to the embargo act, although the purchaser was yet a citizen of the United States. The schooner Good Catherine v. The United States, 7 Cranch, 349; 2 Cond. Rep. 525.
By the 11th section of the act of April 25, 1808, the collector had no right to detain a vessel and her cargo, after her arrival at her port of destination, under a suspicion that she intended to violate the embargo, and such suspicions could not be justified by instructions from the Secretary of the Treasury nor the confirmation of the President. Otis v. Bacon, 7 Cranch, 589 ; 2 Cond. Rep. 618.
Under the 11th section of the embargo act of April 25, 1808, the collector was justified in detaining a vessel by his honest opinion that there was an intention to violate or evade the provisions of the embargo laws. It was not necessary for him to show that his suspicions were reasonable. Crowell et al. v. M'Faddon, 8 Cranch, 94; 3 Cond. Rep. 48.
A bond taken under the first section of the embargo act of January 9,1808, is not void, although taken by consent of the parties, after the vessel had sailed. Speake et al. v. The United States, 9 Cranch, 28 ; 3 Cond. Rep. 244.
The obligors are estopped to deny that the penalty of the bond is double the true value of the cargo. I&zd.
Under the third section of the embargo act of April 25, 1808, a vessel is not subject to forfeiture, for departing without a clearance, unless she has departed out of port. The Active v. The United States, 7 Cranch, 100 ; 2 Cond. Rep. 431.
It seems to be a good defence to an action on an embargo bond, that the same was given for more than twice the value of the cargo, and that the obligors were constrained to execute it by the refusal of a clearance. United States v. Gordon et al., 7 Cranch, 287 ; 2 Cond. Rep. 494.
If the collector justify a detention under the embargo law of April 25, 1808, sec. 11, be need not show that his opinion was correct, nor that he used reasonable diligence in ascertaining the facts on which his opinion was founded. Otis v. Watkins, 9 Cranch, 339; 3 Cond. Rep. 424. See Slocum v. Mayberry, 2 Wheat. 1 ; 4 Cond. Rep. 1; Otis v. Walter, 2 Wheat. 18; 4 Cond. Rep. 10.
Under the embargo act of December 22, 1807, the words, " an embargo shall be laid," not only imposed upon the public officers the duty of preventing the departure of registered or sea-lettered vessels on a foreign voyage, but consequently rendered them liable to forfeiture under the supplementary act of January 9, 1808. In such a case, if the vessel be actually and bona fide carried by force to a foreign port, she is not liable. The William King, 2 Wheat. 148 ; 4 Cond. Rep. 71.
Under the embargo act of April 25, 1808, a vessel not arriving at her port of original destination, excites an honest suspicion in the collector, that a demand of a permit to land a cargo, was merely colourable; this is not a termination of the voyage, so as to preclude the right of detention. Otis v. Walter, 11 Wheat. 192 ; 6 Cond. Rep. 270.
Under the 5th section of the embargo act of January 9, 1808, " a foreign vessel," means a vessel navigating under the flag of a foreign power; and not a vessel owned in whole or in part by foreigners, domicilled in the United States. The Sally, 1 Gallis. C. C. R. 58.
A departure from any place within the jurisdictional limits of the United States, although such place be not within any port, is within the embargo act of December 22, 1807. The Ann, 1 Gallis. C. C. R.
62. A vessel, which during the existence of the embargo laws, departed from one port of the United States
to another, but was obliged from irresistible necessity, to put into a foreign port, and sell her cargo, was not guilty of a violation of the embargo laws. The Brig William Gray, Paine's C. C. R. 16.
The embargo law was passed December 22, 1807. A vessel cleared for St. Mary's, Georgia, on the 15th of January; the collector received information of the passage of the law, and gave notice of it. It did not appear that this was known to the master or owners previous to the sailing. Being seized for a violation of the law, the court ordered her restitution. The Cotton Planter, 1 Paine's C. C. R. 23.
To excuse a vessel which has sailed under an embargo bond, from re-landing her cargo in the United States, under this clause, "the perils of the sea only excepted," the accident must happen without any fault or negligence of the master, and must occur at sea; or if at land, it must be the immediate consequence of the peril happening at sea. United States v. Hall et al., 2 Wash. C. C. R. 366. See the United States v. The Nancy, 3 Wash. C. C. R. 281. The United States v. Morgan et al., 3 Wash. C. C. R. 10. The United States v. Mitchell et al., 3 Wash. C. C. R. 95.
The third section of the embargo act of December 22, 1807, was not repealed by the act of 1809. The Argo, 2 Gallis. C. C. R. 314.
A libel against a vessel for violating the embargo laws, must contain a substantial statement of the offence, with reasonable precision. 1 Brockenb. C. C. R. 347.

ELUCIDATION

Of a convention ivith the Cherokee Nation.

Sept. 11, 1807.

Whe re as , by the first article of a convention between the United States and the Cherokee nation, entered into at the city of Washington, on the seventh day of January, one thousand eight hundred and six, it was intended on the part of the Cherokee nation, and so understood by the Secretary of War, the commissioner on the part of the United States, to cede to the United States all the right, title and interest which the said Cherokee nation ever had to a tract of country contained between the Tennessee river and the Tennessee ridge (so called); which tract of country had since th'e year one thousand seven hundred and ninety four, been claimed by the Cherokees and the Chickasaws: the eastern boundary whereof is limited by a line so to be run from the upper part of the Chickasaw Old Fields, as to include all the waters of Elk river, any thing expressed in said convention to the contrary notwithstanding. It is therefore now declared by James Robertson and Return J. Meigs, acting under the authority of the executive of the
United States, and by a delegation of Cherokee chiefs, of whom Euno-

lee or Black Fox, the king or head chief of said Cherokee nation, acting on the part of, and in behalf of said nation, is one, that the eastern limits of said ceded tract shall be bounded by a line so to be run from the upper end of the Chickasaw Old Fields, a little above the upper point of an island, called Chickasaw Island, as will most directly intersect the first waters of Elk river, thence carried to the Great Cumberland mountain, in which the waters of Elk river have their source, then along the margin of said mountain untill it shall intersect lands heretofore ceded to the United States, at the said Tennessee ridge. And in consideration of the readiness shown by the Cherokees to explain, and to place the limits of the land <?eded by the said convention out of all doubt; and in consideration of their expenses in attending council, the executive of the United States will direct that the Cherokee nation shall receive the sum of two thousand dollars, to be paid to them by their agent, at such time as the said executive shall direct, and that the Cherokee hunters, as hath been the custom in such cases, may hunt on said ceded tract, untill by the fullness of settlers it shall become improper. And it is hereby declared by the parties, that this explanation ought to be considered as a just elucidation of the cession made by tfi,e first article of said convention.

ARTICLES OF A TREATY

Made and concluded at Fort Clark, on the right bank of the Missouri, about five miles above the Fire Prairie, in the territory of Louisiana, the tenth day of November, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and eight, between Peter Chouteau, esquire, agent for the Osage, and specially commissioned and instructed to enter into the same by his excellency Meriwether Lewis, governor and superintendent of Indian affairs for the territory aforesaid, in behalf of the United States of America, of the one part, and the chiefs and warriors of the Great and Little Osage, for themselves and their nations respectively, on the other part.

Nov. 10, 1808. Ratified, April 28, 1810.

Art . 1. The United States being anxious to promote peace, friendship and intercourse with the Osage tribes, to afford them every assistance in their power, and to protect them from the insults and injuries of other tribes of Indians, situated near the settlements of the white people, have thought proper to build a fort on the right bank of the Missouri, a few miles above the Fire Prairie, and do agree to garrison the same with as many regular troops as the President of the United States may, from time to time, deem necessary for the protection of all orderly, friendly and well disposed Indians of the Great and Little

No. 11. Requiring Removal of British Armed Vessels from United States Ports and Waters.

BY THOMAS JEFFERSON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES July 2, 1807. OF AMERICA.

A PROCLAMATION.

Du rin g the wars which, for some time, have unhappily prevailed among the powers of Europe, the United States of America, firm in their principles of peace, have endeavored by justice, by a regular discharge of all their national and social duties, and by every friendly office their situation has admitted, to maintain with all the belligerents their accustomed relations of friendship, hospitality, and commercial intercourse; taking no part in the questions which animate these powers against each other, nor permitting themselves to entertain a wish but for the restoration of general peace, they have observed with good faith the neutrality they assumed, and they believe that no instance of a departure from its duties can be justly imputed to them by any nation.

Penalties of the law threatened.

of their harbors and waters, the means of refitting and of refresnment, of succor to their sick and suffering, have, at all times, and on equal principles, been extended to all, and this too, amidst a constant recurrence of acts of insubordination to the laws, of violence to the persons, and of trespasses on the property of our citizens, committed by officers of one of the belligerent parties received among us. In truth, these abuses of the laws of hospitality have, with few exceptions, become habitual to the commanders of the British armed vessels hovering on our coasts, and frequenting our harbors. They have been the subject of repeated representations to their government. Assurances have been given that proper orders should restrain them within the limit of the rights and of the respect due to a friendly nation ; but those orders and assurances have been without effect; no instance of punishment for past wrongs has taken place; at length a deed, transcending all we have hitherto seen or suffered, brings the public sensibility to a serious crisis, and our forbearance to a necessary pause. A frigate of the United States, trusting to a state of peace, and leaving her harbor on a distant service, has been surprised and attacked by a British vessel of superior force, one of a squadron then lying in our waters and covering the transaction, and has been disabled from service, with the loss of a number of men killed and wounded. This enormity was not only without provocation or justifiable cause, but was committed with the avowed purpose of taking by force, from a ship of war of the United States, a part of her crew ; and that no circumstance might be wanting to mark its character, it had been previously ascertained that the seamen demanded were native citizens of the United States. Having effected her purpose, she returned to anchor with her squadron within our jurisdiction. Hospitality, under such circumstances, ceases to be a duty; and a continuance of it, with such uncontrolled abuses, would tend only, by multiplying injuries and irritations, to bring on a rupture between the two nations. This extreme resort is equally opposed to the interests of both, as it is to assurances of the most friendly dispositions on the part of the British government, in the midst of which this outrage has been committed. In this light, the subject cannot but present itself to that government, and strengthen the motives to an honorable reparation of the wrong which has been done, and to that effectual control of its naval commanders, which alone can justify the government of the United States in the exercise of those hospitalities it is now constrained to discontinue.
In consideration of these circumstances, and of the right of every nation to regulate its own police, to provide for its peace and for the safety of its citizens, and consequently to refuse the admission of armed vessels into its harbors or waters, either in such numbers, or of such descriptions, as are inconsistent with these, or with the maintenance of the authority of the laws, I have thought proper, in pursuance of the authorities specially given by law, to issue this my Proclamation, hereby requiring all armed vessels bearing commissions under the government of Great Britain, now within the harbors or waters of the United States, immediately, and without any delay, to depart from the same, and interdicting the entrance of all the said harbors and waters to the said armed vessels, and to all others bearing commissions under the authority of the British government.
And if the said vessels, or any of them, shall fail to depart as aforesaid, or if they or any others, so interdicted, shall hereafter enter the harbors or waters aforesaid, I do in that case forbid all intercourse with them, or any of them, their officers or crews, and do prohibit all supplies and aid from being furnished to them or any of them.
And I do declare and make known, that if any person from, or within the jurisdictional limits of the United States, shall afford any aid to any such vessel, contrary to the prohibition contained in this proclamation, either in repairing any such vessel, or in furnishing her, her officers or crew, with supplies of any kind, or in any manner whatsoever ; or if any pilot shall assist in navigating any of the said armed vessels, unless it be for the purpose of carrying them, in the first instance, beyond the limits and jurisdiction of the United States, or unless it be in the case of a vessel forced by distress, or charged with public despatches as hereinafter provided for, such person or persons shall, on conviction, suffer all the pains and penalties by the laws provided for such offences.
And I do hereby enjoin and require all persons bearing office, civil or military, within or under the authority of the United States, and all others, citizens or inhabitants thereof, or being within the same, with vigilance and promptitude, to exert their respective authorities, and to be aiding and assisting to the carrying this proclamation, and every part thereof, into full effect.

Provided, nevertheless, that if any such vessel shall be forced into the harbors or waters of the United States, by distress, by the dangers of the sea, or by the pursuit of an enemy, or shall enter them charged with despatches or business from their government, or shall be a pdblic packet for the conveyance of letters and despatches, the commanding officer, immediately reporting his vessel to the collector of the district, stating the object or causes of entering the said harbors or waters, and conforming himself to the regulations in that case prescribed under the authority of the laws, shall be allowed the benefit of such regulations respecting repairs, supplies, stay, intercourse, and departure, as shall be permitted under the same authority.

No. 12. Respecting taking Possession of Part of Louisiana.

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Oct. 27, 1810.

A PROCLAMATION.

Wher eas the territory south of the Mississippi Territory and eastward of the River Mississippi and extending to the River Perdido, of which possession was not delivered to the United States in pursuance of the treaty concluded at Paris, on the 30th April, 1803, has at all times, as is well known, been considered and claimed by them, as being within the colony of Louisiana conveyed by the said treaty, in the same extent that it had in the hands of Spain, and that it had when France originally possessed it.
And whereas, the acquiescence of the United States in the temporary continuance of the said territory under the Spanish authority was not the result of any distrust of their title, as has been particularly evinced by the general

Preamble as to title of the Uni-
ted States to the territory south of Mississippi Territory, eastward of Mississippi River and extending to the River Perdido.

tenor of their laws, and by the distinction made in the application of those laws

between that territory and foreign countries, but was occasioned by their con-

ciliatory views, and by a confidence in the justice of their cause ; and in the suc-

cess of candid discussion and amicable negotiation with a just and friendly

power.

And whereas a satisfactory adjustment, too long delayed, without the fault of

the United States, has for some time been entirely suspended by events over

which they had no control, and whereas a crisis has at length arrived subversive

of the order of things under the Spanish authorities, whereby a failure of the

United States to take the said territory into its possession may lead to events

ultimately contravening the views of both parties, whilst in the mean time the

tranquillity and security of our adjoining territories are endangered, and new

facilities given to violations of our revenue and commercial laws, and of those

prohibiting the introduction of slaves.

Considering, moreover, that under these peculiar and imperative circumstances,

a forbearance on the part of the United States to occupy the territory in ques-

tion, and thereby guard against the confusions and contingencies which threaten

it, might be construed into a dereliction of their title, or an insensibility to the

importance of the state: considering that in the hands of the United States it

will not cease to be a subject of fair and friendly negotiation and adjustment:

considering finally that the acts of Congress tho' contemplating a present pos-

session by a foreign authority, have contemplated also an eventual possession of

the said territory by the United States, and are accordingly so framed, as in

that case to extend in their operation, to the same:

Now be it known that I, JAMES MADISON, President of the United States Possession to of America, in pursuance of these weighty and urgent considerations, have be taken of said deemed it right and requisite, that possession should be taken of the said ter- territory.
