(a) Decisions of the Supreme Court as to the practice and principles regulating the proceedings of the courts of law, which prevail in the Federal courts of Louisiana.
As, by the laws of Louisiana, questions of fact in civil cases are tried by the court, unless either of the parties demand a jury, in an action ofdebt on a judgment, the interest on the original judgment may be computed, and make part of the judgment in Louisiana, without a writ of inquiry, and the intervention of a jury. Mayhew v. Thatcher, 6 Wheat. 129 ; 5 Cond. Rep. 34.
By the provisions of the acts of Congress, Louisiana, when she came into the Union, had organized therein a district court of the United States, having the same jurisdiction, except as to appeals and writs of error, as the circuit courts of the United States in other states ; and the modes of proceeding in that court were required to be according to the principles, rules and usages which belong to courts of equity, as contradistinguished from courts of common law. And whether there were or not, in the several states, courts of equity proceeding according to such principles and usages, made no difference, according to the construction uniformly given by the Supreme Court. Livingston v. Story , 9 Peters , 632.
The provisions of the act of Congress of 1824, relative to the practice of the courts of the United States in Louisiana , contain the descriptive term " civil actions," which embrace cases at law and in equity; and may be fairly construed as used in contradistinction to criminal causes. They apply equally to cases in equity; and if there are any laws in Louisiana directing the mode of proceeding in equity

ing in civil causes in the courts of the United States, that now are, or hereafter may be, established in the state of Louisiana, shall be conform-
able to the laws directing the mode of practice in the district courts of the said state : Provided, That the judge of any such court of the Uni-

civil causes, to be conformable to the laws directing the mode of prac-

causes, they are adopted by that act, and will govern the practice in the courts of the United States. Ibid.
If there are no equitable claims or rights cognisable in the courts of the state of Louisiana, nor any courts of equity, and no state laws regulating the practice in equity causes, the law of May 26, 1824, ch. 181 , does not apply to a case of chancery jurisdiction ; and the district court of Louisiana, was bound to adopt the antecedent modes, authorized under former modes of practice. Ibid.
Under the law of Louisiana, there are two kinds of pledges, the pawn and the antichresis. A thing is said to be pawned, when a movable is given as a security ; the antichresis consists of immovables. Livingston v. Story, 11 Peters, 351 .
L. conveyed in 1822 , in fee simple, to F. and S. , certain real estate in New Orleans, by deed , for a sum of money paid to him, and took from them a counter-letter, signed by them ; by which it was agreed, that on the payment of a sum stated in it, on a day stated, the property should be reconveyed by them to L.; and if not so paid , the property should be sold by an auctioneer ; and, after repaying, out of the proceeds, the sum mentioned in the counter-letter, the balance should be paid to L. The money was not paid on the day appointed , and a further time was given for its payment, with additional interest and charges ; and if not paid at the expiration of the time, it should be sold by an auctioneer. An agreement was at the same time made by L., that the counter-letter should be deliv-
ered up to F. and S. , and cancelled. The money not being paid, it was again agreed between the parties, that if on a subsequent day fixed upon, it should not, with an additional amount for interest, &c., be paid, the property should belong absolutely to F. and S. The money was not paid, and F. and S. afterwards held the property as their own. The Supreme Court held this transaction to be an antichresis, according to the Civil Code of Louisiana ; and on a bill filed in the district court of the United ' States for the eastern district of Louisiana, in 1832 , decreed that the rents and profits of the estate should be accounted for by S. , who had become the sole owner of the property by purchase of F.'s moiety; and that the property should be sold by an auctioneer, unless the balance due S. , after charging the sum due at the time last agreed upon for the payment of the money, and legal interest, with all the expenses of the estate , deducting the rents and profits, should be paid to S.; and on payment of the balance due S. , the residue should be paid to the legal representative of L. Ibid.
The antichresis must be reduced to writing . The creditor acquires by this contract, the right of reap-
ing the fruits, or other rewards of the immovables given to him in pledge, on condition of deducting, annually, their proceeds from the interest, if any be due to him, and afterwards from the principal of his debt. The creditor is bound, unless the contrary is agreed on, to pay the taxes, as well as the
annual charges of the property given to him in pledge. He is likewise bound, under the penalty of damages, to provide for the keeping and necessary repairs of the pledged estate ; and may lay out, from the revenues of the estate , sufficient for such expenses. Ibid.
The creditor does not become proprietor of the pledged immovables, by the failure of payment at the stated time ; any clause to the contrary, is null : and in that case , it is only lawful for him to sue his debtor before the court, in order to obtain a sentence against him, and to cause the objects which have been put into his hands, to be seized and sold. Ibid.
The debtor cannot, before the full payment of his debt, claim the enjoyment of the immovables which he has given in pledge ; but the creditor who wishes to free himself from the obligations under the antichresis, may always, unless he has renounced this right, compel the debtor to retake the enjoyment of his immovables. Ibid.
The doctrine of prescription, under the civil law, does not apply to this case, which is one of pledge ; and if it does, the time before the institution of this suit had not elapsed , in which, by the law of Louisiana, a person may sue for immovable property. Ibid.
By the contract of antichresis, the possession of the property is transferred to the person advancing the money. In case of failure to pay, the property is to be sold by judicial process : and the sum which it may bring, over the amount for which it was pledged, is to be paid to the person making the pledge . Ibid.
If any rule has been made by the district court of Louisiana, abolishing chancery practice in that
court, it is a violation of those rules which the Supreme Court of the United States has passed to regulate the courts of equity of the United States. Those rules are as obligatory on the courts of the United States in Louisiana , as they are upon all other courts of the United States ; and the only modifications or additions which can be made by the circuit or district courts, are such as shall not be inconsistent with the rules prescribed. When the rules prescribed by the Supreme Court do not apply, the practice of the circuit and district courts shall be regulated by the practice of the high court of chancery in England. Story v. Livingston , 13 Peters , 359 .
The Supreme Court has said, upon more than one occasion , after mature deliberation upon able arguments of distinguished counsel against it, that the courts of the United States in Louisiana possess equity powers under the constitution and laws of the United States. That if there are any laws in
Louisiana, directing the mode of procedure in equity causes, they are adopted by the act of 26th May, 1824, ch. 181 , and will govern the practice in the courts of the United States. But if there are no laws regulating the practice in any equity causes, the rules of chancery practice in Louisiana , mean the rules prescribed by the Supreme Court, for the government of the courts of the United States, under the act of Congress of May 8, 1792, ch. 36, sec. 2. Ibid.
No court ought, unless the terms of the act of Congress render it unavoidable , to give a construction to an act, which should, however unintentionally, involve a violation of the Constitution. The terms of the act of 1824 may well be satisfied by limiting its operation to modes of practice and proceedings in the courts below, without changing the effect or conclusiveness of the verdict of a jury upon the facts litigated on the trial, The party may bring the facts into review before the appellate court, so far as they bear

upon the question of law, by a bill of exceptions. Ifthere be any mistake of the facts, the court below is competent to redress it, by giving a new trial . Parsons v. Bedford et al ., 3 Peters, 433.
In the district court of Louisiana, the defendant pleaded the plea of reconvention , which is authorized by the Code of Practice in Louisiana. The district court, on motion of the plaintiffs, ordered the plea to be stricken off. The Code of Practice in Louisiana was adopted in Louisiana, by a statute of that state, passed after the act of Congress of May 26 , 1824, regulating the practice of the district court of the United States for the eastern district of Louisiana, and the practice according to that code has not been adopted as a part of the rules of practice of the district court, when the plea was stricken off. Held, that the plea was properly stricken off. Wilcox et al. v . Hunt, 13 Peters , 378.
In the case of Livingston v. Story, which was before the court in 1835, ( 9 Peters, 655, ) the court took occasion to examine the various laws of the United States establishing and organizing the district court
of the eastern district of Louisiana, and to decide whether that court had equity powers ; and if so, what should be the mode of proceeding in the exercise of those powers. The various cases which had been before the court, involving substantially the same question, in relation to states where there were no equity state courts, or laws regulating the practice in equity causes, were referred to , and the
uniform decisions of the court have been, that there being no equity state courts did not prevent the exercise of equity jurisdiction in the courts of the United States ; and it was accordingly decided that
the district court of Louisiana was bound to proceed in equity causes, according to the principles, rules and usages, which belong to courts of equity as contradistinguished from courts of law. Gaines et al.
v. Relf et al., 15 Peters , 9. When a party seeks relief, which is mainly appropriate to a court of chancery jurisdiction, in the
circuit court of the United States for Louisiana, chancery practice must be followed. McCollum v .
Eager, 2 Howard, 61 . It is impossible to lay down any general rule as to what constitutes multifariousness in a bill in equity.
Every case must be governed by its own circumstances, and the court must exercise a sound discretion .
Gaines et ux. v. Chew et al. , 2 Howard, 619. The exercise of chancery jurisdiction , in the courts of Louisiana, does not introduce any new or
foreign principle. It is only a change in the mode of redressing wrongs and protecting rights. Ibid.

(a) The decisions of the Supreme Court in construction of this act have been : A lot of ground was granted by the Spanish government of Florida, in 1802, to Forbes and Company in the city of Mobile, which was afterwards confirmed by the commissioners ofthe United States. The lot granted was eighty feet in front, and three hundred and four feet in depth, bounded on the east by Water street. This, while the Spanish government had possession of the territory, was known as " a waterlot." Infront of the lot was a lot, which, at the time of the grant of the lot to Forbes and Company, was covered by the water of the bay and river of Mobile, the high tide flowing over it ; and it was separated from Forbes and Company's lot, by Water street. It was afterwards in part reclaimed by Lewis, who had no title to it, and who was afterwards driven off by one of the firm of Forbes and

of the United States to the lots known as the hospital and bake-house United States to
lots, containing about three-fourths of an acre of land, in the city of tahsetlhoetshoksnpiotwanl Mobile, in the state of Alabama ; and also all the right and claim of the and bake-house United States to all the lots not sold or confirmed to individuals, either by lots in the city
Company. A blacksmith's shop was then put on the lot byhim, and Lewis, again by proceedings at law, obtained possession of the blacksmith's shop, it not being his improvement. The improvement was first made in 1823. The Spanish governor in 1809, after the Louisiana treaty of 1803, and before the territory west of the Perdido was out of the possession of Spain, granted the lot in front of the lot owned by Forbes and Company, to William Pollard ; but the commissioners ofthe United States, appointed after the territory was in the full possession of the United States, refused to confirm the same " because of the want of improvement and occupation." In 1824, Congress passed an act, the second section of which gives to those who have improved them, the lots in Mobile, known under the Spanish government as " water lots," except where the lot so improved had been alienated, and except lots of which the Spanish government had made " new grants" or orders of survey during the time the Spanish government had " power" to grant the same, in which case the lot is to belong to the alienee or the grantee. In 1836 , Congress passed an act for the relief of William Pollard's heirs, by which the lot granted by the Spanish government of 1809, was given to the heirs, saving the right of third persons ; and a patent for this lot was issued to the heirs of William Pollard , by the United States, on the 2d July, 1836. Held , that the lot lying east of the lot granted in 1802, by the Spanish government, to Forbes and Company, did not pass by that grant to Forbes and Company; that the act of Congress of 1824, did not vest the title in the lot east ofthe lot granted in 1802, in Forbes and Company ; and that the heirs of Pollard , under the second section of the act of 1824, which excepted from the grant to the city of Mobile , & c. , lots held under " new grants" from the Spanish government, and under the act of Congress of 1836, were entitled to the lot granted in 1809 by the Spanish government to William Pollard.

The act of Congress under which title was claimed , being a private act, and for the benefit of the city of Mobile, and certain individuals ; it is fair to presume it was passed with particular reference to the claims of individuals, and the situation of the land embraced in the law at the time it was passed.
The term " new grant" in its ordinary acceptation, which applied to the same subject or object, is the opposite to " old." But such could not be its meaning in the act of Congress of 1824. The term was doubtless used in relation to the existing condition of the territory in which such grants were made. The territory had been ceded to the United States by the Louisiana treaty, but in consequence of a dispute with Spain about the boundary line, had remained in the possession of Spain . During this time Spain continued to issue evidences of titles to lands, within the territory in dispute. The term " new" was appropriately used as applicable to grants and orders of survey of this description as contradistinguished from those issued before the cession. Ibid.
The time when the Spanish government hadthe " power" to grant lands in the territory , by every reasonable intendment of the act of Congress of 1824, must have been so designated with reference to the existing state of the territory, as between the United States and Spain ; the right to the territory being in the United States and the possession in Spain. The language " during the time at which Spain had the power to grant the same," was under such circumstances very appropriately applied to the case. It could with no propriety have been applied to the case, if Spain had full dominion over the territory, by the union of the right and the possession ; and , in this view, it is no forced interpretation of the word " power" to consider it here used as imparting an imperfect right, and distinguished from complete `lawful authority. Ibid.
The acts of Congress of March 25, 1812, appointing commissioners to ascertain the titles and claims to lands on the east side of the Mississippi, and west side of the Perdido , and falling within the cession of France, embraced all claims to this description. It extended to all claims, by virtue of any grant, order of survey, or other evidence of claim, whatsoever, derived from the French, British or Spanish governments ; and the reports of the commissioners show, that evidence of claims, of various descriptions, issued by Spanish authority, down to 1810, come under their examination. And the legislation of Congress shows many laws passed, confirming incomplete titles, originating after date of the treaty between France and Spain, at St. Ildefonso. Such claims are certainly not beyond the reach of Congress to confirm ; although it may require a special act of Congress for that purpose. Such is the act of Congress of July 2d, 1836, which confirms the title of William Pollard's heirs, to the lot which is the subject of this suit. Ibid.
A lot of ground, part of the ground on which fort Charlotte had been erected, in the city of Mobile, before the territory was acquired from Spain, by the United States, had been sold under an act of Congress of 1818. The lot had been laid out according to a plan by which a street, called Water street, was run along the margin of Mobile river ; and the street was extended over part of the site of fort Charlotte. The lot was situated west of Water street, but when sold by the United States, its eastern line was between high-water mark of the river. The purchaser of this lot improved the lot lying in front of it, east of Water street, having filled it up, at a heavy expense , thus reclaiming it from the river, which at high-water had covered it. When the lot east of Water street was purchased, the
purchaser could not pass along the street, except with the aid of logs , and other timber. Water street, was, in 1823, filled up, at the cost of the city of Mobile. Taxes and assessments for making side-walks, along Water street, were paid to the city of Mobile, by the owner of the lot. The city of Mobile had brought suit for taxes, and had advertised the lot for sale, as the property of a tenant under the purchaser of the lot. On the 26th of May, 1824, Congress passed an act, which declared in the first section, that all the right and claim of the United States to the lots known as the hospital and bake-house lots, containing about three-fourths of an acre of land in the state of Alabama ; and all the right and claim of the United States to all the lots not sold or confirmed to individuals, either by this or any former act, and to which no equitable title exists, in favour of any individual under this or any other act, between high-water mark and the channels of the river, and between Church street and North Boundary street, in front of Mobile, should be vested in the corporation of the city of Mobile for the use of the city forever. The second section provides, " that all the right and claim of the United States to so many

Right and claim of the United States to other lots in

this or any former act, and to which no equitable title exists, in favour of any individual, under this or any other act, between high-water mark and the channel of the river, and between Church street and North Boundary street, in front of the said city, be, and the same are hereby, vested in the mayor and aldermen of the said city of Mobile, for the time being, and their successors in office, for the sole use and benefit of the said city forever.
SEC. 2. And be it further enacted, That all the right and claim of the United States to so many of the lots of ground, east of Water street, and between Church street and North Boundary street, now

of the lots east of Water street, and between Church street and North Boundary street, now known as water lots, as are situated between the channel of the river and the front of the lots , known under the
Spanish government as water lots, in the said city of Mobile wherever improvements have been made , be, and the same are hereby, vested in the several proprietors and occupants of each of the lots heretofore fronting on the river Mobile, &c. " The city of Mobile claimed from the defendant in error the lot held by him, under the purchase from the United States, and the improvements before described ; asserting that the same was vested in the city by the first section of the act of 1824. Held , that under the provisions of the second section of the act, the defendant in error claiming under the purchase made under the act of 1818, and under the act of 1824, was entitled to the lot. The city of Mobile v. Eslava , 16 Peters, 261.
The right relinquished by the United States was to the water lots " lying east of Water street, and between Church street and North Boundary street, now known as water lots, as are situated between
the channel of the river and the front of the lots, known under the Spanish government as water lots, in the said city of Mobile, wherever improvements have been made." The improvements refer to the water and not to the front lots. A reasonable construction of the act requires, the improvements to
have been made or owned by the proprietor of the front lot, at the time of the passage of the act. Being proprietor of the front lot, and having improved the water lot opposite and east of Water street, constitute the conditions on which the right under the statute vests. Ibid.
A grant by the Spanish government confirmed by the United States, was made of a lot of ground in the city of Mobile , running from a certain boundary eastwardly to the river Mobile. The land adjacent to this lot, and extending from high-water mark to the channel of the river, in front of the lot, was held bythe grantee as appurtenant to the last and above high-water mark. The city of Mobile instituted an action to recover the same, asserting a title to it under the act of Congress of May 26, 1824 , granting certain lots of ground to the corporation of the city of Mobile, and to certain individuals in the said city. Held , that this lot was within the exceptions of the act of 1824 ; and no right to the same was vested in the city of Mobile by the act. The city of Mobile v. Hallett, 16 Peters , 261 .
Ejectment to recover possession of a lot in the city of Mobile, Alabama. The defendants, in the circuit court, claimed title to the land under Lucy Landry, who was the devisee of one Geronio ; who having been in possession of the lot at the corner of St. Francis and Royal streets, occupied it until his death. On the arrival of Lucy Landry at age , she occupied the lot as her own property ;
and in 1818 , she sold and conveyed it by deed to certain persons ; stating the eastern boundary in the deed to be the Mobile river. These persons, on the same day, conveyed the premises to Oliver Holman, who entered on it and improved it, by erecting houses and a wharf upon it ; and continued to occupy it as a merchant in co-partnership with one Charles Brown, who lived in Boston, until December, 1822, when he died ; leaving, as his heirs, the lessors of the plaintiff. The possession of Lucy Landry, of the lot, commenced in 1800, and extended on Royal street, and on the east followed the highwater mark on the river. The land was not subject to inundation , though in many places the water ran across it. Until the improvements made by Holman, the lot was not susceptible of occupancy. There was a ridge of high land formed of shells and artificial deposits, to the east of which, to the river, the lot was situated ; and the ridge was protected by the Spanish authorities, no person being permitted by them to improve on the ground or to remove the earth. It was called " The King's Highway," or landing place. Questions as to the title of the proprietors of the adjacent lots above Water street to the lots extending to the river, prevailed until 1824 ; when on the 26th May, 1824 , a law was passed , which granted the lots, known as the water lots under the Spanish government, to the owners of the adjacent grounds. The improvements were made by Holman in 1819 or 1820. The defendants below gave in evidence, to maintain their title, the title to them from Lucy Landry, through her grantees to Oliver Holman : a title bond from Holman to Brown, for half of the lot in controversy, by which a deed was
to be executed two years after the date of the bond ; and an act of the legislature of Alabama, passed in December, 1823, after the decease of Holman, authorizing the administratrix of Holman, then residing in Boston, where administration of the estate of the deceased had been granted to her, to sell the real estate of which he died seised, in the city of Mobile, for the payment of his debts, the estate being insolvent : a deed made in pursuance of a sale of the premises, under the act of assembly and in conformity to the provisions thereof ; and also the record of certain proceedings in the supreme court of Massachusetts, wherein a license was given to the administratrix to make a deed, in pursuance of the title bond to Brown , and the deed , made under this authority. The questions which arose in the case, and on which the court decided, were : First, whether the act of the legislature of Alabama, authorizing the sale of the estate of Holman , was constitutional and valid . Second, whether the proceedings in the supreme court of Massachusetts were operative , and authorized the administratrix to convey the title. Third, whether a volume of state papers, published under the authority of Congress, was evidence. Fourth, whether the lessors of the plaintiff below had established a legal title. Fifth, whether the defendants in the circuit court had not established a title in themselves, independent of and adverse to the title they had derived under Oliver Holman . The act of Congress of May 26 , 1824, relinquished the rights of the United States, whatever they were, in the lot in question, to the proprietor of the front lot. Watkins v.

(a) The 25th section of the post-office law of 1825, which prescribes a penalty for the detention of a letter, refers to a letter or packet detained before it reaches its destination . The United States v. Pearce, 2 M'Lean's C. C. R. 14.
(b) The defendant was indicted upon the 24th section of the act of Congress of March 3, 1825, entitled " An act to reduce into one, the several acts establishing and regulating the post-office department," for advising, procuring and assisting one Joseph Straughan , a mail carrier, to rob the mail; and was found guilty. Upon this finding, the judges of the circuit court of North Carolina were divided in opinion on the question, whether an indictment founded on the statute for advising, &c. , a mail carrier to rob the mail , ought to set forth or aver that the said carrier did , in fact, commit the offence of robbing the mail ? By the Supreme Court-The answer to this, as an abstract proposition, must be in the affirmative. But if the question intended to be put, is, whether there must be a distinct substantive averment of that fact, it is not necessary. The indictment in this case sufficiently sets out that
the offence had been committed by the mail carrier. United States v. Mills, 7 Peters , 138. The offence charged in this indictment is a misdemeanor, where all are principals ; and the doc-
trine applicable to the principal and accessary in cases of felony does not apply. The offence, however charged against the defendant, is secondary in its character ; and there can be no doubt that it must sufficiently appear upon the indictment, that the offence alleged against the chief actor had been committed. Ibid.
Upon an indictment for robbing the mail , and putting the life ofthe person having the custody of it in jeopardy, under the 19th section of the act of April 30th , 1810, ch. 262, a sword , &c. in the hand of the robber, by terror of which the robbery is effected , is a dangerous weapon within the act, putting the life in jeopardy ; though it be not drawn or pointed at the carrier. So a pistol in his hands, by means of which the robbery is effected, is a dangerous weapon ; and it is not necessary to prove that it was charged ; it is presumed to be so until the contrary is proved. The United States v. Wood , 3 Wash. C. C. R. 440.
It is not necessary to a conviction, under the 22d section , that the carrier of the mail should have
taken the oath prescribed by the 2d section of the act of 1825, or that the whole mail be taken. The United States v. Wilson et al. 1 Baldwin's C. C. R. 102 .
All persons present at the commission of a crime, consenting thereto, aiding, or assisting and abetting therein, or in doing any act which is a constituent of the offence, are principals. Ibid.
The word " rob," in the act of Congress of 1825, sec . 22, is used in the common law sense. Ibid. 93.
66 Jeopardy," as used in the section , means a well-grounded apprehension of danger to life, in case of refusal to yield to threats, or resistance . Ibid.

feloniously stealing a quantity of merchandise , belonging to the ship Bristol, the ship being in distress and cast away on a shoal of the sea on the coast of New York. The indictment was founded on the 9th section of the act, entitled " An act more effectually to provide for the punishment of certain crimes againstthe United States, and forother purposes," approved March 3, 1825. The goods were taken above high-water mark, upon the beach, in the county of Queens, in the state of New York. Held, that the offence committed was within the jurisdiction of the circuit court. The United States v . Coombs , 12 Peters, 72.
In cases purely dependent on the locality of the act done , the admiralty jurisdiction is limited to the sea, and to the tide water, as far as the tide flows. Mixed cases may arise, and often do arise , where
the act and services done are of a mixed nature, as when salvage services are performed , partlyon tidewater and partly on shore, for the preservation of the property ; in which case the admiralty jurisdiction has been constantly exercised , to the extent of decreeing salvage. Ibid.
The offence of larceny is not punishable under the act 1790 , ch. 9, unless committed in a place under the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the United States ; and to bring the case within the statute, there must be an averment of such sole and exclusive jurisdiction in the indictment. The United States v. Edmund Davis , 5 Mason's C. C. R. 356.
" Personal goods" in that statute does not include choses in action , the latter not being the subject of larceny at common law. Ibid.

Where larceny is committed in a place not under the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the United States, it may be yet punishable under the third section of the act of 1825, ch . 65. Ibid.
Offences are punishable under that section according to the state laws, where they are committed under circumstances, or in places, in which, before that act, no court of the United States had authority to punish them. Ibid.
It seems, that a reservation in a cession of " concurrent jurisdiction" to serve state process, civil and criminal in the ceded place , does not exclude the exclusive legislation , or exclusive jurisdiction of the United States , over the ceded place . It merely operates as a condition of the grant. Ibid.
See United States v. Kessler, Baldwin's C. C. R. 15.

(a) The crimes act of 1825, ch. 65, sec. 10, enumerates three distinct offences : (1 ) maliciously and
wilfully, and without justifiable cause, forcing an officer or mariner on shore, in a foreign port, or
(2) maliciously, or without justifiable cause, leaving any officer or mariner behind in a foreign port, or (3) maliciously, or without justifiable cause, refusing to bring home again all the officers or mariners of
the ship, in a condition to return and willing to return. It is not necessary to complete the first or second of the enumerated offences, that the officer or mariner should be in a condition to return or
willing to return . These latter words apply only to the trial of the enumerated offences. The United States v. Netcher, 1 Story's C. C. R. 307.
Where a mariner applied for a discharge , which was refused by the master, and he thereupon used
abusive language to the master, for which he was imprisoned by the master, so that he was unable to
return , and the ship sailed without him, it was held , that the leaving him behind was an offence under the crimes act of 1825, ch . 65 , sec. 10. Ibid.
Indictment for maliciously, and without justifiable cause, forcing a seaman on shore, in a foreign port, against the crimes act of 1825, ch. 65, sec. 10. " Maliciously," in the statute , means wilfully, against a knowledge of duty ; " justifiable cause" does not mean such a cause as the known policy of the American laws on the subject contemplates as a cause of moral necessity, for the safety of the ship and crew, or the due performance of the voyage. The United States v. Thaddeus Coffin, 1 Sumner's C. C. R. 394.
Under the 10th section of the act of 1825 , ch. 65 , the forcing a mariner on shore must be done , not only without justifiable cause , but also maliciously, tojustify a conviction . Ifdone under a mistaken sense of duty, it is not a case for conviction . The United States v. Spencer Ruggles, 5 Mason's C. C. R. 192.
" Maliciously," in the statute, means with a wilful disregard of right and duty, or doing the act, against a man's own conviction of duty. Ibid.
A master of a ship has authority to confine his seamen in a common jail in a foreign port, for offences and misconduct in extreme cases ; and when the proper correction and punishment cannot be effected on ship-board. Ibid.

(a) Where the United States instituted an action for the recovery of a sum of money on a bond given with sureties by a purser in the navy, and the defendants, in substance , pleaded that the bond, with the condition thereon , was variant from that prescribed by law, and was, under colour of office , extorted from the obligor and his sureties, contrary to the statute, by the then Secretary of the Navy, as the condition of the purser remaining in the office, and receiving the emoluments, and the United States demurred to the plea ; it was held, that the plea constituted a good bar to the action. The United States v. Tingey , 5 Peters , 114 .
No officer of the government has a right, by colour of his office, to require from any subordinate officer, as a condition for his holding his office, that he should execute a bond with a condition different from that prescribed by law. That would be, not to execute , but to supersede the requisites of
the law. It would be very different, when such bond was, by mistake or otherwise, voluntarily, substi tuted by the parties for the statute bond , without any coercion , or extortion by colour of office. Ibid.

(a) Forgeries under the laws of the United States must be tried in the district where the crime is committed. The United States v. Britton, 2 Mason's C. C. R. 464.
In an indictment for forgery, itis in general necessary to set forth the tenor of the instrument, and it must be proved as set forth. Ibid.
(b) Passing a paper is putting it off on payment or exchange. Uttering it , is a declaration that it is
good , with an intent to pass, or an offer to pass it. United States v. Mitchell et al. , Baldwin's C. C. R. 366. The party accused of passing or uttering counterfeit paper, must be present when the act is done,
privy to it, or aiding, consenting , or procuring it to be done. If done by consent, all are equally guilty. Ibid.
Passing a counterfeit note in the name of a fictitious person, an assumed name , or on a bank which never existed , is within the law. It is not necessary that the note, if genuine should be valid, if on its face it purports to be good. The want of validity must appear on its face. Ibid.
The possession of other counterfeit papers, by the defendant, or a confederate, at the time of passing counterfeit notes, is evidence of the scienter. Ibid.
The law presumes the intention of passing counterfeit paper, to be to defraud any person who may suffer a loss by receiving it as genuine. The United States v. Shellmire, Baldwin's C. C. R. 370 .
Intoxication is no defence to a charge of passing counterfeit bank notes, if the defendant was possessed of his reason , and was capable of knowing whether the note so passed was good or bad. Ibid.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United Whenever a
States of America in Congress assembled, That, whenever a commis- commission shall be issued,
sion shall be issued, by any court of the United States, for taking the

(a) The decisions of the courts ofthe United States upon the laws relating to commissioners to take testimony have been :

Depositions taken under a commission issued at the instance of the defendant, may be read in evidence by the plaintiff, although the plaintiff had no notice ofthe time and place of taking them. Yeaton v. Fry, 5 Cranch, 335 ; 2 Cond . Rep. 273.
The court will not award a commission to take the testimony of absent witnesses until the commissioners are named . Van Stephorst v. The state of Maryland , 2 Dall . 401 ; 1 Cond. Rep . 2.
Under particular circumstances the court allowed a special commission, to take the depositions of witnesses, with instructions : 1. That the interrogatories should be filed in the court here by both parties previous to the issuing of the commission. 2. That the commissioners should be directed not to

admit any additional interrogatories. 3. That neither parties nor counsel should be allowed to appear before the commissioners. Cunningham v. Otis , 1 Gallis. C. C. R. 166.
Commissioners to take depositions of witnesses, act under a special authority derived from the court, which must be strictly pursued ; and, therefore, where a commission had issued to four commissioners

jointly to take depositions, and it was executed and returned by three only, although both of the commissioners nominated by the defendant, had acted ; yet he may object to the reading of the depositions, and the objections will be sustained . Armstrong v. Brown , 1 Wash. C. C. R. 34.
A commission to take testimony, which had issued in a case in which the United States was a

party, was set aside, because it had been opened by an officer ofthe government before it came into the hands ofthe clerk, and a new commission was ordered , to which the original papers, which had been
annexed to the first commission, were attached. The United States v. Price's Adm'rs , 2 Wash. C. C. R. 356.

A commission to take evidence in an enemy's country, in a prize cause, is contrary to the established practice in a prize court. The Diana, 2 Gallis. C. C. R. 93.

Each interrogatory , annexed to the commission, should be substantially answered, at least ; and the
omission, so to answer, is fatal to the whole testimony of the witness : although, in his answer to the general interrogatory, the witness has said he knows nothing material to either party. Ketland v. Bissett, 1 Wash. C. C. R. 144.

Where a commission to take evidence was executed in a foreign country, the government of which refused to let the commissioners act, considering it an assumption ofthe sovereign power, but the commission was executed by a judge ofthe court in the presence of the commissioners ; the depositions were permitted to be read, as otherwise the course of justice might be impeded . In such a case the evidence must be fairly taken ; all the evidence on each side must be put and answered. If, however, the interrogatories have been substantially put and answered, it is sufficient. Winthrop v. The Union Ins. Co. , 2 Wash. C. C. R. 7.

It is no objection to the reading of a deposition , taken under a commission to a foreign country, that the same witness had been previously examined and cross-examined in the United States. Ibid.

A joint commission to take the depositions of witnesses, must be executed by all the commissioners,

R2

197

198

NINETEENTH CONGRESS . SESS. II. CH. 4. 1827.

by any court of the United States, for taking the testimony of a

testimony of a witness or witnesses, at any place within the United States, or the territories thereof, it shall be lawful for the clerk of any
court of the United States, for the district or territory within which such place may be, and he is hereby enjoined and required, upon

to make the depositions evidence, although the commissioners named by the party making the objection, after proceeding some length in the examination of the witnesses, withdrew. Muns v. Dupont, 2 Wash. C. C. R. 563.
The provision of the judiciary act of 1789, ch. 20, sec. 30, as to taking depositions, de bene esse, does not apply to cases pending in the Supreme Court of the United States, but only to cases in the district and circuit courts. Testimony, by depositions, can only be regularly taken for the Supreme Court, under a commission issuing according to the rules of the court. The Argo, 2 Wheat. 287 ; Cond. Rep. 119.
Depositions taken according to the proviso in the 13th section of the judiciary act of 1789, ch. 20, under a " dedimus potestatem," " according to common usage, where it may be necessary to prevent a failure or delay of justice," are, under no circumstances, to be considered as taken de bene esse, whether the witness reside beyond the process of the court, or within it : the provision ofthe act relative to depositions, de bene esse , being confined to those taken under the enacting part of the section. Sergeant's Lessee v. Biddle et al . 4 Wheat. 508 ; 4 Cond . Rep. 522.
A commission was issued in the name of Richard M. Meade , the name of the party being Richard W. Meade. This is a clerical error in making out the commission , and does not affect the execution of the commission . Keene v. Meade , 3 Peters, 1.
It is not known that there is any practice in the execution or return of a commission , requiring a certificate, in whose handwriting the depositions returned with the commission were set down. All that the commission requires , is, that the commissioners, having reduced the depositions taken bythem to writing, should send them with the commission , under their hands and seals, to the judges of the court out of which the commission issued . But it is immaterial in whose handwriting the depositions are ; and it cannot be required that they should certify any immaterial fact. Ibid. 8.
A certificate by the commissioners, that A. B. , whom they were going to employ as a clerk, had been sworn, admits of no other reasonable interpretation than that A. B. was the person appointed by them as clerk. Ibid. 9.
It is not necessary to return with the commission the form of the oath administered by the commissioners to the witnesses. When the commissioners certify the witnesses were sworn , and the interro-
gatories annexed to the commission were all put to them, it is presumed that they were sworn and examined as to all their knowledge of the facts. Ibid. 10.
The plaintiffs issued a commission to take testimony abroad, and the defendant joined in the same, by filing cross-interrogatories, but the plaintiffs afterwards found a witness to prove the facts they desired to establish by the commission ; and they abandoned it. The court said a trial under those circumstances, would be a surprise on the defendant. Le Roy v. The Delaware Ins. Co., 2 Wash. C. C. R. 223.
If the cross-interrogatories are not put to a witness examined under a commission to take testimony, the examination of the witness cannot be read on the trial. Gilpins v . Consequa , Peters' C. C. R. 86.
It is no objection to a deposition taken under a commission to Holland, that it is in the English language, the commissioners before whom it was taken being Dutchmen, and not stating that they had the assistance of an interpreter. Ibid.
It is not an objection to the evidence taken under a commission , that the cross-interrogatories were not put to each witness, immediately after he had answered the chief interrogatories, but were put to him after all the chief interrogatories had been answered by all the witnesses. Ibid.
A commission is not defectively executed , because the commissioners and their clerk were not sworn. Ibid.
Those who execute a commission are appointed by the court, and although they may be nominated by the parties, they are not their agents. Ibid.
If all the interrogatories, which accompany a commission , are substantially, although not severally answered, it is sufficient ; and this principle applies as well to the answers given to the interrogatories annexed to letters rogatory, as to answers under a commission. Nelson v. The United States, Peters' C. C. R. 235.
The circuit court of the United States will issue letters rogatory, for the purpose of obtaining the testimony of witnesses, when the government of the place where the evidence is to be obtained will not permit a commission to be executed. Ibid.
The testimony of a witness , taken under a commission , directed to five persons, or any one of them, cannot be read in evidence if another person than the commissioner, and who was not named in the commission, assisted in taking the examinations of the witnesses. Willings v. Consequa, Peters' C. C. R. 301.
A commission directed to A. to be executed in one county , cannot be executed by him in another. The commissioner ought to state when and where the commission was executed. He acts under a
special authority. The depositions were rejected, being obnoxious to this principle. Bourdereau et al. v. Montgomery et al. , 4 Wash. C. C. R. 186.
If the general interrogatory, under a commission , is not answered , it is a fatal objection to the whole deposition ; all the interrogatories must be substantially answered . Dodge v. Israel , 4 Wash . C. C. R. 323.
Query, If it is not an objection to a deposition , that it was committed to writing by the witness before he was sworn ; and whether exhibits, referred to in a deposition , ought not to be annexed by the commissioners to the deposition, or so designated by them as to leave noreasonable doubt of their identity. Ibid.
If reasonable notice of formal objections to the depositions taken under a commission, be not given, the court may be induced to set aside a verdict or nonsuit rendered in consequence of this objection, without costs. Ibid.
Depositions taken, under a commission , to another state, cannot be read, unless proof be given

in the said subpoena to be stated, and also to bring or carry with him or her, and produce to such commissioner or commissioners, any paper, writing,

possession or power of such witness, such judge being satisfied, by the

affidavit of the person applying, or otherwise, that there is reason to be-

lieve that such paper, writing, written instrument, book, or other document, is in the possession or power of the witness, and that the same, if

produced, would be competent and material evidence for the party applying therefor, may order the clerk of the court, of which he is a judge, to

issue such subpoena duces tecum, accordingly, and if such witness, after being duly served with such subpoena duces tecum, shall fail to produce

any such paper, writing, written instrument, book, or other document, being in the possession or power of such witness, and described in such

that a copy of the interrogatories, and a written notice of the rule for a commission, and the names of the commissioners, were served on the opposite party or his attorney, according to one of the rules of the circuit court of Pennsylvania. Lessce of Rhoads and Snyder v. Selin, 4 Wash. C. C. R. 715.
It is no objection to a deposition , that a material part of the evidence comes out under the general interrogatory. Ibid.
A commission was issued under a rule to take depositions at Selinsgrove, and was endorsed " commission to Selinsgrove ." It should appear, by the certificate of the commissioners, or otherwise, that the depositions were taken at the place indicated, or they cannot be read. Ibid.
Affidavits to be used as further proof, in causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction in the Supreme Court, must be taken by commission. The London Packet, 2 Wheat. 371 ; 4 Cond. Rep. 162.
A deposition taken under a commission is fatally defective, if the general interrogatory, " Do you know any thing further," &c ., is not answered . Richardson v. Golden, 3 Wash. C. C. R. 109.
If a commission issue to A. & B. , or either of them, to take the depositions of witnesses, the depositions of A. may be taken before B. Lonsdale v. Brown, 3 Wash. C. C. R. 404.
Evidence to establish heirship and pedigree, had been obtained under a commission issued for that purpose to France , in an action of ejectment, in which the plaintiffs had recovered the lots of ground for which the suit was instituted. In the course of that trial, a bill of exceptions was tendered by the

It is the settled doctrine of the judicial department of the government, that the treaty of 1819, with Spain, ceded to the United States no territory west of the Perdido. It had already been acquired bythe Louisiana treaty. Pollard et al. v. Files, 2 Howard, 591 .
In the interval between the Louisiana treaty and the time when the United States took possession of the country west of the Perdido , the Spanish government had the right to grant permits to settle and improve by cultivation or to authorize the erection of establishments for mercantile purposes.

These incipient concessions are not disregarded by Congress, but are recognised in the acts of 1804, 1812 , 1819, and as claims are within the act of 1824. Ibid.
The act of 1824 gives a title to the owners of old water lots in Mobile, only where an improvement was made east of Water street, and made by the proprietor of the lot on the west side of that street, such person could not claim as riparian proprietor, or where his lot had a definite limit on the east.

It may issue against his goods and chattels, and against his credits and effects, in the hands of third persons. Manro v. Almeida, 10 Wheat. 473 ; 6 Cond. Rep. 190 .
It seems that an attachment cannot issue without an express order of the judge , but it may be issued simultaneously with the monition ; and where the attachment issued in this manner, and in pursuance of the prayer of the libel , the Supreme Court will presume that it was regularly issued . Ibid.
The act for regulating processes in the courts of the United States, provides that the forms and modes of proceeding in courts of equity, and in those of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, shall be according to the principles, rules and usages which belong to courts of equity, and to courts of admiralty, respectively, as contradistinguished from courts of common law, subject, however, to alterations by the courts, &c. This act has been generally understood to adopt the principles, rules and usages of the court of chancery of England. Hinde v. Vattier. 5 Peters, 398.
Process of foreign attachment cannot be properly issued by the circuit courts of the United States, in cases where the defendant is domiciled abroad, or not found within the district in which the process issues, so that it cannot be served upon him . Toland v. Sprague , 12 Peters , 300.
By the general provisions of the laws of the United States : 1. The circuit courts can issue no process beyond the limits of their districts. 2. Independently of positive legislation , the process can only be served upon persons within the same districts. 3. The acts of Congress adopting the state process ,
adopt the form and modes of service only, so far as the persons are rightfully within the reach of such process ; and did not intend to enlarge the sphere of the jurisdiction of the circuit courts. 4. The
right to attach property to compel the appearance of persons, can properly be used only in cases in which such persons are amenable to the process of the circuit court, in personam ; that is , where they are inhabitants, or found within the United States ; and not where they are aliens, or citizens resident abroad, at the commencement of the suit , and have no inhabitancy here . Ibid.
In the case of a person being amenable to process, in personam, an attachment against his property cannot be issued against him, except as a part of, or together with process to be served upon his person . Ibid.
The circuit and district courts of the United States cannot, either in suits at common law or equity, send their process into another district, except where specially authorized so to do, by some act of Congress . Ex parte Graham, 3 Wash. C. C. R. 456.
The marshal may have an attachment to enforce the payment of his fees of office, against suitors in the court. Anonymous, 2 Gallis. C. C. R. 101 .
The court will not dictate to the marshal, what return he shall make to process in his hands . He must make his return at his peril, and any person injured by it, may have his legal remedy for such return. Wortman v. Conyngham , Peters' C. C. R. 241 .
Congress has, by the constitution, exclusive authority to regulate proceedings in the courts of the United States ; and the states have no authority to control those proceedings ; except so far as the state process acts are adopted by Congress, or by the courts of the United States, under the authority of Congress. Wayman v. Southard , 10 Wheat. 1 ; 6 Cond. Rep. 1 .
The 14th section of the judiciary act of 1789, ch . 20 , authorizes the courts of the United States to issue writs of execution , as well as other writs. Ibid.
The 34th section of the judiciary act of 1789, ch. 20, does not apply to the process and practice ofthe courts. It merely furnishes a rule of decision, and is not intended to regulate the remedy. Ibid.
The process act of 1792 , ch. 137, is the law which regulates executions issuing from the courts of the United States : and it adopts the practice of the supreme courts of the states, in 1789, as the rule for governing proceedings on such executions, subject to such alterations as the courts of the United States may make, but not subject to the alterations which have since taken place in the state laws and practice. Ibid.
The statutes of Kentucky concerning executions, which require the plaintiff to endorse on the execution, that bank notes of the Bank of Kentucky, or notes ofthe Bank ofthe Commonwealth of Kentucky, will be received in payment, and on his refusal , authorize the defendant to give a replevin bond for the debt, payable in two years, are not applicable to executions issued on judgments rendered by the courts of the United States.

The laws of the United States authorize the courts of the Union so to alter the form of the process of execution used in the supreme courts of the states in 1789 , as to subject to execution , issuing out of the federal courts , lands and other property not thus subject by the state laws in force at that time. Bank of the United States v. Halstead , 10 Wheat. 51 ; 6 Cond . Rep. 22.
A subpoena duces tecum may issue to the President of the United States. 1 Burr's Trial , 183.
A party cannot be arrested in Pennsylvania, on an attachment from the circuit court in Rhode Island, for contempt, in not appearing in that court after a monition served upon him in Pennsylvania, to answer in a prize cause depending in the court in Rhode Island. Ex parte Graham, 3 Wash. C. C. R. 456.
A writ of error does not lie to an order of the court below to stay the proceedings finally, upon suggestion of the attorney of the United States, in a case to which the United States are not parties ; but the court will award a mandamus nisi , in the nature of a procedendo. Livingston v. Dorgenois, 7 Cranch, 577 ; 2 Cond. Rep. 618.
The marshal of the District of Columbia is bound to serve a subpoena in chancery, as soon as he reasonably can ; and he will, in case of neglect, be answerable to the plaintiff, who has, in consequence of such neglect, sustained any loss. Kennedy v. Brent, 6 Cranch, 187 ; 2 Cond. Rep. 345.
On a capias, in assumpsit against three, and one arrested, who gives bail, and non est inventus as to the others, if the party files his declaration and proceeds against the one arrested, he cannot afterwards bring in the others by alias capias, and make them parties to the suit. United States v. Parker, 2 Dall. 373.
An alias capias must be tested , as of the term to which the original writ was returned . Ibid. A term cannot intervene between the teste and return of a writ of error. Hamilton v. Moore, 3 Dall. 371 ; 1 Cond. Rep. 168. If the defendant below intermarries after the judgment, and before the service of the writ of error, the service of the citation upon the husband will be sufficient. Fairfax's Ex'rs v. Fairfax, 5 Cranch, 19 ; 2 Cond . Rep. 178. There is no act of Congress which authorizes a circuit court to issue a compulsory process to the district court for the removal of a cause from that jurisdiction before a final judgment or decree is pronounced. If a certiorari should issue in such a case, the district court may and ought to refuse obedience to the writ : and after the cause is thus removed, either party may move for a procedendo , or pursue the cause in the district court, in like manner as if the record had not been removed. But, if instead of taking advantage of this irregularity, the defendant enter his appearance in the circuit court, take defence and plead to issue, it is too late after verdict to object to the irregularity. The cause will be considered as an original one in the circuit court, made so by consent of parties, even though no declaration de novo should be filed in the circuit court. Patterson v. The United States, 2 Wheat. 221 ;
4 Cond. Rep. 98. Whenever, by the state laws in force in 1789 , a capias might issue from a state court, the acts of 1789
and 1792, extending, in terms, to that species of writ, must be understood to have adopted its use per. manently in the federal courts. United States v. January, 10 Wheat. 66. In a note .
At an early period after the organization of the federal courts, the rules of practice in force in the state courts, which were similar to the English practice, were adopted by the judges of the circuit court. A subsequent change in the practice of the state courts, will not authorize a departure from the rules adopted in the circuit court. Anonymous, Peters' C. C. R. 1 .
Whenever, by the laws of the United States, a defendant is to be arrested, the process of arrest employed in the state, shall be pursued. 2 Burr's Trial , 481 .
Upon executing a writ of inquiry, in Virginia, in an action of assumpsit upon a promissory note , it is necessary to produce a note, corresponding with that stated in the declaration ; but it is not necessary to prove the note. Sheehy v. Mandeville, 7 Cranch, 208 ; 2 Cond. Rep . 476.
A party charged with a crime , even before indictment found , may have compulsory process for his witnesses. But his omitting to avail himself of this right is not such negligence as will deprive him of
the benefit of having his cause postponed, if his witnesses be absent ; but it will justify the court in imposing terms on him. United States v. Moore , Wallace's C. C. R. 23.
The process act of Congress, of 1828, was passed shortly after the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, in the case of Wayman v. Southard, and the Bank of the United States v. Halsted, and was intended as a legislative sanction of the opinions of the court in those cases. The power given to the courts of the United States, by this act, to make rules and regulations on final process, so as to conform the same to the laws of the states on the same subject, extends to future legislation ; and as well to the modes of proceedings on executions, as to the forms of writs. Ross & King v. Duval et al., 13 Peters , 45.
All proceedings for attachments are on the civil side of the courts, and are to be entitled with the names of the parties, until an attachment issues ; after which they are on the criminal side . United States v. Wayne, Wallace's C. C. R. 134.
The courts of chancery of the United States will, under circumstances, order a commission of rebellion, to be returnable forthwith. Ibid.
The judiciary act of 1789, ch. 20, does not contemplate compulsive process against any person in any district, unless he be an inhabitant of, or found within, the same district at the time of serving the writ. Picquet v. Swan, 5 Mason's C. C. R. 35.
The act of Massachusetts of 1797 , ch. 50, prescribing the modes ofserving process,does not apply to a case where the defendant has been an inhabitant, but at the time ofthe suit brought has his actual domicil in another state or country. Ibid.
Under the statute of Massachusetts of 1823 , ch. 142, giving relief against fraud to secure attaching creditors, it is not necessary that the second attachment should be returnable to the same term of the

Where there is a scire facias to revive a judgment, the defendant cannot avail himself of matters of
defence which occurred previous to the original judgment. United States v. Thompson, Gilpin's D. C. R. 622.

Laws which relate to practice, process, or modes of proceeding before or after judgment, are exceptions to the 34th section of the judiciary act of 1789, as Congress have legislated on the subject. The Supreme Court of the United States have established the distinction to be this : State laws, which furnish the court a rule for forming a judgment, are binding on the federal courts, not laws for carrying

that judgment into execution ; that is governed by the acts of Congress, and the rules of practice adopted in pursuance thereto. Thompson v. Phillips, Baldwin's C. C. R. 274.

The act of the legislature of Ohio, of February, 1820, relative to proceedings against parties to promissory notes, by which all the parties to a note might be proceeded against in one suit, was a very wise and benevolent law, and its salutary effects produced its immediate adoption into the practice of the courts of the United States, and the suits have, in many instances, been prosecuted under it. Fullerton v. The Bank of the United States, 1 Peters , 604.

Although the act of the legislature of Ohio, regulating the mode of proceeding in actions on promissory notes, was passed after the making of the note upon which this action was brought, yet the circuit court of the United States for the district of Ohio, having incorporated the action under that statute, with all its incidents, into its course of practice , and having full power by law to adopt it, there does

not appear any legal objection to its doing so, in the prosecution of the system under which it has always acted. Yeaton v. Lenox, 8 Peters , 123.

The process act of 1828 expressly adopts the mesne process, and modes of proceeding in suits at common law, then existing in the highest state court, under the state laws ; which of course included all the

regulations of the state laws as to bail, and exemptions of the party from arrest and imprisonment. In regard, also, to writs of execution , and other final process, and " the proceedings thereupon ;" it adopts an equally comprehensive language , and declares they shall be the same as were then used in the courts of the state. Beers v. Haughton , 9 Peters, 329.

The circuit court of each district, sit within and for that district, and are bounded by its local limits. Whatever may be the extent of the jurisdiction of the circuit court over the subject matter of suits, in respect to persons and property, it can only be exercised within the limits ofthe district. Congress might have authorized civil process from any circuit court to have run into any state of the Union. It has not done so. It has not, in terms, authorized any civil process to run into any other district ; with

the single exception of subpoenas to witnesses within a limited distance. In regard to final process, there are two cases, and only two, in which writs of execution can now by law be served in any other district than that in which the judgment was rendered ; one in favour of private persons in another dis-

trict of the same state ; and the other in favour of the United States, in any part of the United States.

(a) Act relating to the courts of Florida, vol . iii. 752. The following case, which originated in the courts established by the act of May 23, 1826 , contains decisions upon principles of admiralty law, of great general interest. The schooner North Carolina, bound from Appalachicola to Charleston , with a cargo ofcotton , part on account of the consignees, and part the property of the shipper, struck on a reef about ninety-five miles from Key West ; and the next morning one hundred and ten bales of cotton were taken from her by the wrecking schooner Hyder Ally, when she floated , and she sailed with the Hyder Ally to Indian Key, and arrived there the same evening. The Hyder Ally was one of those wrecking schooners in the profits of which Houseman was a participator. He became the consignee of the North Carolina ; and salvage being claimed by the master of the Hyder Ally, a reference was made by the master of the North Carolina, and the master of the wrecker, and by an award thirty-five per cent. was allowed as salvage ; and one hundred and two bales of cotton were put into the storesof Houseman, in part payment of the salvage ; and one hundred dollars was paid in cash, and a draft for six hundred dollars was given by the captain of the North Carolina , in further satisfaction of the salvage , and the commissions of Houseman, with the vessel's expenses. Afterwards, the consignees of the cotton sent an agent to Key West, who proceeded , by a libel in his name , as agent in the superior court of the United States of Monroe county in Florida , alleging the facts, and by process issued by the court, seventy-two bales of the cotton of the North Carolina were attached in the hands of Houseman . The court decreed that
the libellant should recover the seventy -two bales of cotton, and Houseman appealed to the court of appeals. In that court, a supplemental libel was filed by the appellee, claiming damages for the taking and the detention of fifty other bales of cotton , making the whole number of one hundred and twentytwo bales, which had gone into the possession of Houseman. The court of appeals gave a deeree in favour of the appellee for the value of one hundred and twenty-two bales. The Supreme Court affirmed the decree as to the seventy-two bales, and set aside that part of the decree which allowed the value of the fifty bales ; leaving the consignees or owners of the fifty bales to proceed in the superior court of East Florida by a new libel for the recovery of the same or the value thereof. Houseman v. The Schooner North Carolina , 15 Peters , 40 .
There are many cases in which the contract of the captain , in relation to the amount of salvage to be paid to the salvors, or his agreement to refer the question to arbitrators, would bind the owners. In times
ofdisaster, it is always his duty to exercise his best judgment, and to use his best exertions for the benefit
of both the vessel and cargo : and when, from his situation , he is unable to consult them or their agent, without an inconvenient and injurious delay, it is in his power to compromise a question of salvage, and he is not bound in all cases to wait for the decision of a court of admiralty. Ibid.
So, too , when the salvage service has not been important, and the compensation demanded is a sinall one, it may often be the interest of the owners, that the amount should be settled at once by the captain, and the vessel proceed on her voyage, without waiting even a day for the purpose of consulting them . But in all such cases, unless the acts of the captain are ratified by the owners, his conduct will be carefully watched and scrutinized by the court ; and his contracts will not be regarded as binding on the
parties concerned , unless they appear to have been bona fide, and such as a discreet owner, placed in the same circumstances, would probably have made. If he settles the amount by agreement, those who claim under it must show that the salvage allowed was reasonable and just. If he refers it to arbitrators, those who claim the benefit of the award, must show that the proceedings were fair, and the referees worthy of the trust. Ibid.
The case is within the jurisdiction of a court of admiralty. It is a question of salvage of a vessel which had been stranded on a reef in the ocean. The points in controversy are whether salvage is due, and if due, how much. The admiralty is the only court in which such a question can be tried. Ibid.
It is well settled in admiralty proceedings, that the agent of absent owners may libel either in his own name, as agent, or in the name of his principals, as he thinks best. That a power of attorney given subsequent to the libel is a sufficient ratification of what he had before done in their behalf, and that the consignees of a cargo have a sufficient interest in the cargo that they may proceed in the admiralty for the recovery not only of their own property, but for that part of it which may be consigned to them.

shall leave particular places , and arrive at others, and to determine whether it shall leave the same place only once a day, or more frequently. Ibid.
It is not, therefore, the mere frequency of the departure of the carriages, carrying the mail, that constitutes an abuse of the privilege of the United States, but the unnecessary division of the mail-bags among a number of carriages, to evade the payment of tolls. Ibid.

Be it enacted bythe Senate and House ofRepresentatives ofthe United States ofAmerica, in Congress assembled, That the following appropriations be, and the same are hereby, made, and directed to be paid out of any money in the treasury not otherwise appropriated, to enable the Secretary of the Treasury to provide, by contract, for building lighthouses, lightboats, beacons, and monuments, and placing buoys, to wit :

One who was not a Quaker, who refused to be sworn as a witness, on the ground of conscientious scruples, arising from a declaration formerly made, was committed , by the circuit court of Massachusetts for a contempt of the court ; the liberty to affirm being strictly confined to Quakers, by the law and practice of Massachusetts. The United States v. Coolidge, 2 Gallis. C. C. R. 364.
That a counsellor, practising in the highest court of the state of New York, in which he resides, had been struck off from the roll of counsellors of the district court of the United States for the northern
district of New York, by the order of the judge of that court for a contempt , does not authorize the Supreme Court to refuse his admission as a counsellor of the Supreme Court. Ex parte Tillinghast, 4 Peters , 108.
The Supreme Court does not consider the circumstances upon which the order of the district judge was given within its cognisance ; or, that it is authorized to punish for a contempt, which may have been committed in the district court of the northern district of New York. Ibid.
If, from any collateral evidence , it should appear that there is reason to believe the respondent has perjured himself, the circuit court will recognise him to answer at the next term of the court, to such matters as may be found against him. United States v. Dodge , 2 Gallis. C. C. R. 313.
Unfair practices towards a witness who is to give testimony in court, or oppression under colour of its process, although those practices and that oppression were acted out of the district in which the court is sitting, may be punished by attachment, provided the person who has thus demeaned himself comes within the jurisdiction of the court. But, it is also believed that this mode of punishment ought not to be adopted , unless the deviation from law could be clearly attached to the person against, whom the motion was made ; and unless the deviation were intentional ; or unless the course of judicial proceeding were or might be so affected by it as to make a punishment in this mode obviously conducive to a fair administration of justice. 1 Burr's Trial, 355.
Any publication, pending a suit, reflecting upon the court, the jury, the parties, the officers of the court, the counsel, &c . , in reference to the suit, or tending to influence the decision of the controversy, is a contempt of the court, and punishable by attachment. Hollingsworth v. Duane, Wallace's C. C. R. 77.
For contempts to inferior jurisdictions, not of record, nor having a general power to fine and imprison, unless committed in presence of the officer, and punished instanter, there is no other mode of punishment than by indictment. Ibid.
It is not a contempt to serve a party, while attending at the court as a party in the cause, or as a witness, with a summons. The privilege extends to exemption from arrest, but no further. Blight's Ex'rs v. Fisher et al . , Peters ' C. C. R. 41.
It is a contempt of court to serve process, either of summons or capias, in the actual or constructive presence ofthe court. Ibid.

(a) Under the provisions of the act ofCongress, passed 26th May, 1824, ch. 173, proceedings were instituted in the superior court of the territory of Arkansas, by which a confirmation was claimed of a grant of land alleged to have been made to the petitioner, Sampeyreac, by the Spanish government prior to their cession of Louisiana to the United States , by the treaty of April 3, 1803. This claim was opposed by the district attorney of the United States, and the court, after hearing the evidence , decreed that the petitioner recover the land from the United States. Afterwards the district attorney of the United States, proceeding on the authority ofthe act of Congress, May 8, 1830 , filed a bill of review, founded on the allegation that the original decree was obtained by fraud and surprise; that the documents produced in support of the claim of Sampeyreac were forged , and that the witnesses who had been examined to sustain the same were perjured. At a subsequent term Stewart was allowed to become a defendant tothe bill of review, and filed an answer, in which the fraud and perjury are denied , and in which he asserts that if the same were committed he is ignorant thereof; and asserts that he is a bona fide purchaser ofthe land, for a valuable consideration , from John J. Bowie , who conveyed to him the claim of Sampeyreac, by deed, dated the 22d October, 1828. On a final hearing the superior court ofthe territory of Arkansas, being satisfied of the forgery, perjury, and fraud , reversed the original decree.

The treaty by which Louisiana was ceded to the United States, recognised complete grants, issued anterior to the cession, and a decision of a state court against the validity of a title set up under such
a grant, would be subject to revisal by the Supreme Court, under the twenty-fifth section of the Judiciary act. M'Donough v. Millaudon, 3 Howard, 693.
But, if the state court only applies the local laws ofthe state to the construction of the grant, it is not a decision against its validity, and the Supreme Court has no jurisdiction . Ibid.
Congress, in acting upon complete grants, recognised them as they stood ; and the act of 11th of May, 1820, confirming such as were recommended for confirmation by the register and receiver, had no reference to any particular surveys. lbid.
A decision of a state court, therefore, which may be in opposition to one of these surveys, is not against the validity of a title existing under an act of Congress ; and this court has no jurisdiction in such a case. Ibid.

Leaving this certificate out of the case, the instruments executed by the Baron de Carondelet, in 1795 and 1797, have not the aid of any authentic survey to ascertain and fix the limits of the land, and to determine its location. Ibid.
The Supreme Court has repeatedly decided, and in cases, too , where the instrument contained clear words of grant, that if the descriptions were vague and indefinite, and there was no official survey to give it a certain location, it could create no right of private property, in any particular parcel of land,
which could be maintained in a court of justice. Ibid. An equitable title is no defence in a suit brought by the United States. An imperfect title derived
from Spain, before the cession, cannot be supported against a party claiming under a grant from the United States. Ibid.
The act of Congress of the 29th April , 1816, confirming the grant to the extent of a league square, restricted it to that quantity, and cannot be construed as confirming the residue . Ibid.

Both were regulated by the law of nations, according to which the rights of property are protected , even in the case of a conquered country ; and held sacred and inviolable when it is ceded by treaty, with or without any stipulation to such effect : and the laws, whether in writing, or evidenced by the usage and customs of the conquered or ceded country, continue in force, until altered by the new sovereign. Strother v. Lucas, 12 Peters, 410.
No principle can be better established by the authority of the Supreme Court, than " that the acts of an officer, to whom a public duty is assigned by his king, within the sphere of that duty, are prima facie taken to be within his power." The principles on which it rests, are believed to be too deeply , founded in law and reason, ever to be successfully assailed. He who would controvert a grant executed by the lawful authority, with all the solemnities required by law, takes on himself the burden of showing that the officer has transcended the powers conferred upon him ; or that the transaction is tainted with fraud. Ibid.
Where the act of an officer to pass the title to land according to the Spanish law, is done contrary to the written order of the king, produced at the trial , without any explanation ; it shall be presumed that the power has not been exceeded ; that the act was done on the motive set out therein ; and according to some order known to the king and his officers, though not to his subjects ; and courts ought to require very full proof, that he had transcended his powers, before they so determine it. Ibid.
In favour of long possession and ancient appropriation , every thing which was done shall be presumed to have been rightfully done ; and though it does not appear to have been done, the law will presume that whatever was necessary has been done. Ibid.
The stipulations of the treaty ceding Louisiana to the United States affording that protection or security to claims under the French or Spanish government to which the act of Congress refers, are in the first, second, and third articles. They extended to all property until Louisiana became a member of the Union ; into which the inhabitants were to be incorporated as soon as possible , " and admitted to all the rights, advantages and immunities of citizens ofthe United States." The perfect inviolability and security of property is among these rights. Delassus v. The United States, 9 Peters , 117.
The right of property is protected and secured by the treaty, and no principle is better settled in this country, than that an inchoate title to lands is property. This right would have been sacred , independent of the treaty. The sovereign who acquires an inhabited country, acquires full dominion over it ; but this dominion is never supposed to divest the vested rights of individuals to property. The language of the treaty ceding Louisiana , excludes any idea of interfering with private property. Ibid.
On the 18th of April , 1802 , the lieutenant-governor of Upper Louisiana granted sixteen hundred arpents of land near certain rivers named in the grant, with directions to survey the same in a vacant place of the royal domain ; but no survey was made before the cession of Louisiana to the United States. By the court-As the grant contained no description ofthe land granted , and was not located within the time prescribed by the act of Congress of the 10th of March, 1804 , it comes directly within the point decided by the Supreme Court in the case of John Smith, T. , and cannot be confirmed. Wherry v. The United States, 10 Peters, 338.
In repeated decisions the Supreme Court have affirmed the authority of local governors, under the crown of Spain , to grant land in Louisiana, before the same was ceded by Spain to France and the court have also affirmed the validity of descriptive grants, though not surveyed before the 11th of March, 1804, in Missouri, and the 24th of January, 1818, in Florida. Mackey v. The United States, 10 Peters, 340.
A grant or concession made by an officer who is by law authorized to make it, carries with it prima facie evidence that it is within his powers. No excess of them , or departure from them, is to be presumed. He violates his duty by such excess, and is responsible for it. He who alleges that an officer intrusted with an important duty has violated his instructions , must show it. Delassus v. The United States, 9 Peters , 117.
The instructions of governor O'Reilly, relative to granting lands in Louisiana , were considered by the court in 8 Peters, 455. These regulations were intended for the general government of subordinate
officers, and not to control and limit the power of the person from whose will they emanated . The Baron De Carondelet must be supposed to have had all the powers which had been vested in Don O'Reilly, and a concession ordered by him is as valid as a similar concession directed by governor O'Reilly would have been. Ibid.
A concession of land was made by the lieutenant-governor of Upper Louisiana , at the time when the power of granting lands was vested in the governors of provinces. This power was, in 1799, after the concession, transferred to the intendant-general : and after this transfer, in January , 1800 , the order of survey of the land was made by the lieutenant-governor. The validity of the order of survey depends on the authority of the lieutenant-governor to make it. The lieutenant-governor was also a sub-delegate, and as such was empowered to make inchoate grants. The grant was confirmed . Chouteau's heirs v. the United States , 9 Peters , 137.
The transfer of the power to make concessions of lands belonging to the royal domain of Spain, from the governor-general to the intendant-general , did not affect the power of the sub-delegate , who made this concession . The order in this case is the foundation of title, and is, according to the act of

Claims to be classed, & c.

to be appointed by the President of the United States, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to examine all the unconfirmed claims to land in that state, heretofore filed in the office of the said recorder, according to law, founded upon any incomplete grant, concession, warrant, or order of survey, issued by the authority of France or Spain, prior to the tenth day of March, one thousand eight hundred and four ; and to class the same so as to show, first, what claims, in their opinion, would in fact have been confirmed, according to the laws, usages, and

customs of the Spanish government, and the practice of the Spanish

authorities under them, at New Orleans, if the government under which

claims, in their opinion, are destitute of merit, in law or equity, under

such laws, usages, customs, and practice of the Spanish authorities afore-

said ; and shall also assign their reasons for the opinions so to be given.

And in examining and classing such claims, the recorder and commis-

sioners shall take into consideration, as well the testimony heretofore

taken by the boards of commissioners and recorder of land titles upon

those claims, as such other testimony as may be admissible under the

rules heretofore existing for taking such testimony before said boards

SEC. 2. And be it further enacted, That the office of the recorder shall be open for the purposes of such examination for the term of two years from the date of the organization of the board of commissioners and no longer ; and the recorder and commissioners shall proceed in the examination in a summary manner, with or without any new application of

Congress on the subject of confirming titles to lands in Missouri , &c. , and the general understanding and usage of Louisiana and Missouri, capable of being perfected into a complete title. It is property, capable of being alienated , of being subjected to debts : and is, as such, to be held as sacred and inviolate as other property. Ibid.
A concession of one league square of land , in Upper Louisiana, was made by Don Zenon Trudeau, the lieutenant-governor of that province, to Auguste Chouteau, and a decree made by him directing the surveyor-general of the province to put him in possession of the land , and to survey the same, in order to enable Chouteau to solicit a complete title thereto from the governor-general , who by the said decree was informed that the circumstances of Chouteau were such as entitled him to a grant of the land . The land was surveyed , and the grantee put in full possession of it on the 20th of December, 1803. He re-
tained possession of it until his death . The objection to the validity of the concession was, that the petitioner had not as many tame cattle as the eighth regulation of governor O'Reilly, governor-general of Louisiana, required. That regulation required that the applicant for a grant of a league square of land should make it appear that he is possessed of one hundred head of tame cattle, some horses and sheep, and two slaves to look after them, a proportion which shall always be observed for the grants, &c. By the Court-In the spirit of the decisions which have been heretofore made by the Supreme Court, and of the acts of confirmation passed by Congress , the fact that the applicant possessed the requisite amount of property to entitle him to the land he solicited , was submitted to the officer who decided on the application ; and he is not bound to prove it to the court, which passes on the validity of the grant. These incomplete titles were transferable , and the assignee might not possess the means of proving the exact number of cattle in possession of the petitioner when the concession was made. The grant was confirmed. Ibid. 147.
Ifthe court can trust the information received on this subject, neither the governor nor the intendantgeneral has ever refused to perfect an incomplete title granted by a deputy-governor or a sub-delegate. Ibid.
The regulation made by Don O'Reilly, as to the quantity of land to be granted to an individual , is not that no individual shall receive grants for more than one league square , but that no grant shall exceed a league square. The words of the regulation do not forbid different grants to the same person, and, so far as the court are informed , it has never been so construed. Ibid.
Under the act of February 17, 1815, ch. 45 , a New Madrid certificate could be located upon lands before they were offered for sale under a proclamation of the President, or even surveyed by the public surveyor. Barry v. Gamble, 3 Howard, 32.
The act of April 26 , 1822, ch. 40, recognised locations of this kind , although they disregarded the sectional lines by which the surveys were afterwards made. Ibid.
Under the acts of 1805, 1806, and 1807, it was necessary to file the evidence of an incomplete claim under French and Spanish authority, which bore date anterior to 1800 , as well as those which were dated subsequent to that day ; and in case of neglect, the bar provided applied to both of these classes. Ibid.
A title, resting on a permit and warrant of survey, dated before the 1st of October, 1800, without any settlement or survey having been made, was an incomplete title , and within those acts. Ibid.
And although the acts of 1824 and 1828 remove the bar as it respected the United States, yet having excepted such lands as have been sold , or otherwise disposed of by the United States, and saved the right or title of adverse claimants, these acts protected a New Madrid claim, which had been located while this bar continued.

(a) Under the act of Congress passed July 14, 1832 , ch . 227, entitled " An act to alter and amend the several acts imposing duties on imports," worsted shawls with cotton borders, and worsted suspenders with cotton straps or ends, are not subjected to a duty of fifty per cent. ad valorem. Elliott v. Swartwout, 10 Peters , 137.

Laws imposing duties on goods are intended for practical use and application by men engaged in commerce, and hence it has become a settled rule in the interpretation of statutes of this description to construe the language adopted by the legislature, and particularly in the denomination of articles, according to the commercial understanding of the terms used. Ibid.

Construction of statutes : The principles applied in the courts of the United States, in relation to the construction of statutes of the United States, and of statutes in general . The suspension of a statute for a limited time , is not a repeal of it. Brown, plaintiff in error, v. Barry, 3 Dall . 365 ; 1 Cond . Rep. 165 . The intention of the legislature , when discovered , must prevail ; any rule of construction, declared by previous acts, to the contrary notwithstanding. Ibid. The presumption must always be in favour ofthe validity of a law if the contrary is not clearly demonstrated. Cooper v. Telfair, 4 Dall . 14 ; 1 Cond . Rep . 211. A legislative act founded on a mistaken opinion of what was law, does not change the actual state of the law, as to pre-existing cases. Talbot v. Seeman , 1 Cranch 1 ; 1 Cond. Rep. 229. It is true, that in mere private cases between individuals, a court will and ought to struggle hard against a construction, which will, by a retrospective operation , affect the rights of parties ; but in great national concerns, where individual rights acquired by war are sacrificed for national purposes, the contract making the sacrifice ought always to receive a construction conforming to its manifest import ; and if the nation has given up the vested rights of its citizens, it is not for the court, but for the government, to consider whether it be a case proper for compensation . United States v. The Schooner Peggy. 1 Cranch, 103 ; 1 Cond . Rep. 256. If courts are to regard the constitution , and the constitution is superior to any ordinary act of the legislature ; the constitution, and not such ordinary act, must govern the case to which they both apply. Marbury v. Madison , 1 Cranch, 137 ; 1 Cond . Rep . 267. In the construction of a statute, positive and explicit provisions, comprehending in terms a whole class of cases, are not to be restrained by applying to those cases an implication drawn from subsequent words ; unless that implication be very clear, necessary, and irresistible. Faw v. Marsteller, 2 Cranch, 10 ; 1 Cond. Rep. 337. Where a case is shown to be out of the mischief intended to be guarded against, or out of the spirit of the law ; the letter of the statute will not be deemed so unequivocal as absolutely to exclude another construction. Ibid.

It is said the case ought to be an extraordinary one, that the circumstances ought to be uncommon,
which would warrant a departure from the general principles established for the government of contracts. This is true , and the Supreme Court would certainly not feel itself at liberty to exercise , on a
common occasion, a discretionary power, limited only by the opinion entertained of the naked justice of the case. Ibid.

That a law is the best expositor of itself; that every part of an act is to be taken into view for the purpose of discovering the mind of the legislature ; and that the details of one part may contain regulations restricting the extent of general expressions used in another part of the same act ; are among those plain rules laid down by common sense for the exposition of statutes, which have been uniformiy acknowledged . Pennington v. Coxe, 2 Cranch, 33 ; 1 Cond . Rep. 346.
It is undoubtedly a well-established principle in the exposition of statutes, that every part is to be considered, and the intention of the legislature to be extracted from the whole. It is also true that

Third. On all manufactures of cotton, or of which cotton shall be a component part, twenty-five per centum ad valorem, excepting cotton
twist, yarn, and thread, which shall remain at the rate of duty fixed by the act to amend the several acts imposing duties on imports, of twenty-

Manufactures opafrctoctottotno, no.r of 1824, ch. 136.

where great inconvenience will result from a particular construction , that construction is to be avoided ; unless the meaning of the legislature be plain ; in which case it must be obeyed . United States v. Fisher et al. , Assignees of Blight, 2 Cranch, 358 ; 1 Cond. Rep. 421.
That the consequences are to be considered in expounding laws, where the intent is doubtful, is a principle notto be contradicted ; but it is also true, that it is a principle which must be applied with caution; and which has a degree of influence dependent on the nature of the case to which it is applied , when rights are infringed. lbid.
Where fundamental principles are overthrown , where the general system ofthe laws is departed from, the legislative intention must be expressed with irresistible clearness, to induce a court of justice to suppose a design to effect such objects . But when only a political regulation is made which is inconvenient ; if the intention of the legislature be expressed in terms which are sufficiently intelligible to leave no doubt in the mind , when the words are taken in their ordinary sense ; it would be going a great way to say that a constrained interpretation must be put upon them, to avoid an inconvenience which ought to have been contemplated in the legislature , when the act was passed ; and which, in their opinion, was probably overbalanced by the particular advantages it was calculated to produce. Ibid.
In cases depending on the statutes of a state, the settled construction of these statutes, by the state courts, is to be regarded. Polk's Lessee v. Wendal , 9 Cranch , 87 ; 3 Cond. Rep. 286.
In the construction of the statutes or local laws of a state, it is frequently necessary to recur to the history and situation of the country, in order to ascertain the reason as well as the meaning of many of them, to enable a court to apply with propriety the different rules for construing statutes. Preston v. Browder, 1 Wheat. 115 ; 3 Cond . Rep . 508.
The best judges in England have been of opinion , that relaxing the construction of the statute of frauds ought not to be extended further than it has already been carried ; and the Supreme Court entirely concurs in that opinion . Grant v. Naylor, 4 Cranch, 224 ; 2 Cond. Rep. 95.
An act of Congress ought never to be construed to violate the law of nations, if any other possible construction remains ; and consequently can never be construed to violate neutral rights , or to affect neutral commerce, further than is warranted by the law of nations, as understood in this country. Murray v. The Charming Betsey, 2 Cranch , 64 ; 1 Cond. Rep. 358.
When an act of Congress is revived by a subsequent act, it is revived precisely in that form , and with that effect, which it had at the moment when it expired. The cargo of the Brig Aurora v. The United States, 7 Cranch , 382 ; 2 Cond. Rep. 540.
It is a general rule , in the construction of public statutes, that the word " may" is to be construed " must," in all cases where the legislature mean to impose a positive and absolute duty, and not merely to give a discretionary power. And in all cases , the construction should be such as carries into effect the true intent and meaning of the legislature in the enactment. Minor et al. v. The Mechanics' Bank of Alexandria, 1 Peters , 46.
Where English statutes, such for instance as the statute of frauds , and the statute of limitations, have been adopted into our own legislation ; the known and settled construction of those statutes by English courts of law has been considered as silently incorporated into the acts ; or has been received with all the weight of authority. Pennock v. Dialogue et al . , 2 Peters, 1 .
Where the question upon the construction ofthe statute of a state relative to real property has been settled by any judicial decision in the state where the land lies ; the Supreme Court, upon the uniform principles adopted by it, would recognise that decision as a part of the local law. Gardner v. Collins, 2 Peters, 58.
A legislative act is to be interpreted according to the intention of the legislature , apparent upon its face. Every technical rule as to the construction or force of particular terms, must yield to the clear expression of the paramount will of the legislature. Wilkinson v. Leland et al. , 2 Peters, 627.
In cases not absolutely closed by authority, the Supreme Court has always expressed a strong inclination not to extend the operation of the statute offrauds so as to embrace original and distinct promises, made by different persons at the same time, upon the same general consideration. Townsley v. Sumrall , 2 Peters , 182.
The Supreme Court has been often called upon to consider the sixteenth section of the judiciary act of 1789, and as often , either expressly or by the course of its decisions, has held that it is merely declaratory ; making no alteration whatever in the rules of equity on the subject of legal remedy. Boyce's Executors v. Grundy, 3 Peters , 210.
The rule which has uniformly been observed by the Supreme Court in construing statutes, is to adopt the construction made by courts ofthe country, by whose legislature the statute was enacted . This rule may be susceptible of some modification, when applied to British statutes which are adopted in any of the states. By adopting them they become our own, as entirely as if they had been enacted by the legislature of the state. Cathcart et al. v. Robinson , 5 Peters , 264.
The construction which British statutes had received in England at the time of their adoption in this country, indeed to the time ofthe separation of this country from the British empire , may very properly be considered as accompanying the statutes themselves, and forming an integral part of them. But how-
ever subsequent decisions may be respected , and certainly they are entitled to great respect, their absolute authority is not admitted. If the English courts varytheir construction of a statute which is common to both countries, we do not hold ourselves bound to fluctuate with them . Ibid.
Generally statutes are to be construed to operate in futuro, unless a retrospective effect be clearly intended. Prince v. The United States , 2 Gallis. C. C. R. 204.
The word 6 or has sometimes been construed to mean and. Such construction has been clearly necessary to give effect to a clause in a will, or to some legislative provision , but never to change a contract at pleasure . Douglass v. Eyre , Gilpin's D, C, R. 148.

nent part, not dyed, colored, printed, or stained, not exceeding in value . thirty cents the square yard, shall be valued at thirty cents per square

Where a British statute is re-enacted in this country, it is reasonable to suppose that the legislature designed to adopt, as well the settled construction which had been given to the act by the British courts, as the act itself. Kirkpatrick et al . v. Gibson's Executors, 2 Brockenb. C. C. R. 388.
In doubtful cases, a court should compare all the parts of a statute , and different statutes in pari materia, to ascertain the intention of the legislature . The Sloop Elizabeth , Paines's C. C. R. 11 .
Semble : That in questions of commercial law the courts of the United States are not concluded by the local construction proceeding from state courts. Donnell v. The Columbian Ins. Co., 2 Sumner's C. C. R. 366.
In the construction of statutes, one part must be construed by another. In order to attest the legislative intention, the whole statute must be inspected. Strode v. Stafford Justices, 1 Brockenb. C. C. R. 162.
It is a rule of law that a statute applicable in its terms to particular actions, cannot be applied by
construction to other actions standing on the same reasons. Jacob v. The United States, 1 Brockenb. C. C. R. 520.
Penal laws must be construed strictly to bring the case within the definition of the law, but not so as to exclude a case within their ordinary acceptation . The United States v. Wilson and Porter, 1 Baldwin's C. C. R. 78.
Laws are construed strictly to save a right, or avoid a penalty ; and liberally to give a remedy, or effect an object declared in the law. Whitney et al. v. Emmett et al. , 1 Baldwin's C. C. R. 316.
The provisions of a law which are merely directory, are not to be construed into conditions precedent. Ibid.
The mercantile terms are to be taken in the sense intended , which is to be ascertained by the laws in pari materia. The United States v . Twenty-four Coils of Cordage, 1 Baldwin's C. C. R. 505.
The words of a law imposing a forfeiture or penalty, should not be construed to embrace a case not within the parts of the law which prohibits the act done , or direct the performance of an act, by the omission of which the penalty or forfeiture is incurred. Ibid. 508.
If a section of an act of Congress admits of two interpretations , one of which brings it within , and the other pushes it beyond the constitutional authority of Congress ; it is the duty of the Supreme Court to adopt the former construction ; because a presumption never ought to be indulged , that Congress meant to exercise or usurp any unconstitutional authority ; unless that construction is forced on the court by language altogether incongruous. The United States v. Coombs, 12 Peters , 72.
Upon the general principles of interpreting statutes, when the words are general , the court are not at liberty to insert limitations not called for by the sense, or the objects, or the mischiefs of the enactment. Ibid.
The office of a proviso , generally, is either to except something from the enacting clause, or to qualify or restrain its generality, or to exclude some possible ground of misinterpretation of its extending to cases not intended by the legislature to be brought within its purview. Ibid.
The court in construing an act will not consider the motives, or reasons, or opinions , expressed by individual members of Congress in debate, but will look, if necessary, to the public history of the times in which it was passed. Aldridge et al. v. Williams, 3 Howard , 1 .
An act of Congress imposing a duty upon imports, must be construed to describe the article upon which the duty is imposed according to the commercial understanding of the terms used in the law, in our own markets, at the time when the law was passed. Curtis v. Martin, 3 Howard, 106.
Revenue laws for the prevention of fraud, for the suppression of a public wrong, or to effect a public good, are not in a strict sense penal statutes , although they impose a penalty. But they ought to be so construed as most effectually to accomplish the intention of the legislature, in passing them, instead of being construed with great strictness in favour of the defendant. Taylor et al. v. The United States, 3 Howard, 197.
A clause of forfeiture in a law is to be construed differently from a similar clause in an engagement between individuals. A legislature may impose it as a punishment, but individuals can only make it a matter of contract. The State of Maryland v . The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company , 3 Howard, 534.
Statutes in pari materia , should be taken into consideration in construing a law. If a thing contained in a subsequent statute be within the reason of a former statute, it shall be taken to be within the meaning of that statute. The United States v. Freeman , 3 Howard , 556.
If it can be gathered from a subsequent statute in pari materia, what meaning the legislature attached to the words of a former statute, this will amountto a legislative declaration of its meaning, and will govern the construction of the first statute. Ibid.
The meaning of the legislature may be extended beyond the precise words used in the law, from the reason or motive on which the legislature proceeded , from the end in view, or the purpose which was designed ; the limitation of the rule being that to extend the meaning in any case not included within the words, the case must be shown to come within the same reason upon whichthe law-maker proceeded , and not a like reason. Ibid.
In affirmative statutes, such part of a prior as may be incorporated into the subsequent statute , as consistent with it, must be considered in force. Davies v. Fairbairn , 3 Howard , 636.
If a subsequent statute be not repugnant in all its provisions to a prior one , yet if the latter statute clearly intended to prescribe the only rules which should govern, it repeals the prior one. Ibid.
In the construction of penal statutes, the proper course is to search out and follow the true intent of the legislature and to adopt that sense which harmonizes best with the context, and promotes , in the fullest manner, the apparent policy and objects of the legislature . The United States v. Winn, 3 Sumner's C. C. R. 209.
In construing an act of Congress , if there be a mistake apparent on the face of the act, which may

(c) A seizure was made in the port of New Orleans, under the sixty-seventh section of the act of March 2, 1799, ch. 22, regulating the collection of duties, which authorizes the collector, when he shall suspect a false and fraudulent entry to have been made of any goods, wares, and merchandise, to cause an examination to be made ; and if found to differ from the entry, the merchandise is to be forfeited, unless it shall be made to appear to the collector, or to the court in which a prosecution for the forfeiture shall be had, that such difference proceeded from accident or mistake, and not from an intention to defraud the revenue. The United States, by the collector of Mississippi, seized, as falsely entered at the custom-house in New Orleans, certain casks of sugar, which had been entered as " syrup," alleging that they were sugar, in a partial solution in water. The libel charged the entry to have been made with a fraudulent intention of evading the
duty on sugar. The claimant gave evidence tending to show that the article seized was, in the prevailing mercantile understanding of the term, deemed syrup, and not sugar.

Decisions of the courts of the United States on the remission and distribution of theproceeds ofpenalties andforfeitures :
Action of indebitatus assumpsit, was brought by the officers of the revenue cutter of the district of Delaware , for one half of the forfeiture incurred for a violation of the non-intercourse law, by a vessel seized by the collector of Delaware, on the information of the plaintiffs , and sent by him to the district of Pennsylvania for trial, where she was condemned , and the amount ofthe forfeiture was received by the defendant, the collector of the port of Philadelphia. Held, 1st. The information to induce a seizure need not be as full as the evidence in the case would authorize to condemn . It is sufficient if it induced
the prosecution. 2d. It is not necessary that the officers of the revenue cutter should , where they gave the information, make a claim for a part of the forfeiture ; or that they should take any part in the prosecution of the case, to entitle them to a portion ofthe proceeds. 3d. The consent of the plaintiffs that the vessel should be sent from the district of Delaware, to the district of Pennsylvania ; or a disavowal by them, of having instituted this suit, does not constitute a waiver of their right to their share of the

Abond was given to T. S. , the collector of the district of Petersburg , under the second section of the embargo act of the 22d of December, 1807 , and a suit was afterwards brought by him on the same bond in the district court ; and pending the proceedings, to wit, on the 30th of October, 1811 , J. S., the collector, died ; and judgment was recovered in favour of the United States, on the 30th of November, 1811. On the 26th of the same November, J. J. was appointed collector of the same district, and entered on the duties of his office on the 14th of December, 1811 ; until which time T. S. , who was deputy collector under J. S. , at his decease, continued as such to discharge the duties of the office . The judgment of the district court was subsequently affirmed by the circuit court. When the bond was
taken, A. T. was surveyor of the district, and continued in that office until his death, which was after the commencement of the suit on the bond, and before judgment thereon, and was succeeded by J. H. P., who was appointed on the 30th of March, 1811 , and entered on the duties of his office on the 16th of the same month. It was held , that the personal representatives of the deceased collector and surveyor, and not their successors in office , were entitled to that portion of the penalty which is, by law, to be distributed among the revenue officers of the district where it was incurred . There being no naval officer in the district, the division was adjudged to be made in equal proportions between the collector and surveyor. Jones and others v. Shore's Executors and others, 1 Wheat. 462 ; 3 Cond. Rep. 624.
The Secretary of the Treasury has authority, under the remission act of the 3d of March, 1797 , ch. 13, to remit a forfeiture or penalty accruing under the revenue laws, at any time , before or after a final sentence of condemnation or judgment for the penalty, until the money is actually paid over to the collector for distribution. United States v. Morris , 10 Wheat. 246 ; 6 Cond. Rep. 90.
Such remission extends to the shares of the forfeiture or penalty to which the officers of the customs are entitled, as well as to the interest of the United States. Ibid.
The ship Good Friends, and her cargo of British merchandise , owned by Stephen Girard , a citizen of the United States , was seized by the collector ofthe Delaware district, on the 19th ofApril , 1812 , for a violation ofthe non-intercourse laws ofthe United States then in force. The ship and cargo were condemned as forfeited, in the district and circuit court ofthe Delaware district. On the 29th July, 1813 , Congress passed "An act for the relief of the owners of the Good Friends," & c., and a remission of the forfeiture was granted by the Secretary of the Treasury, under the authority of that act, with the exception of a sum equal to the double duties imposed by an act of Congress passed on the 1st of July , 1812. The collector was entitled to one moiety of the whole amount reserved by the Secretary of the Treasury, as the condition of the remission. M'Lane v. The United States, 6 Peters, 404.
Where a sentence ofcondemnation has been finally pronounced in a case of seizure, the Supreme Court, as an incident to the possession of the principal cause, has a right to proceed to decree a distribution of the proceeds, according to the terms prescribed by law. And it is a familiar practice to institute proceedings for the purpose of such distribution , whenever a doubt occurs as to the rights ofthe parties, who are entitled to share in the distribution. Ibid.
The duty of the collector in superintending the collection of the revenue, and of making seizures for supposed violations of law, is onerous and full of perplexity. If he seizes any goods, it is at his own peril ; and he is condemnable in damages and costs, if it should turn out upon the final adjudication, that there was no probable cause for the seizure. As a just reward for his diligence, and a compensation for his risks ; at once to stimulate his vigilance and secure his activity, the laws of the United States have awarded to him a large share of the proceeds of the forfeiture. But his right by the seizure is but inchoate ; and although the forfeiture may have been justly incurred, yet the government has reserved to itself the right to release it, either in whole or in part, until the proceeds have been actually received for distribution ; and in that event, and to that extent, it displaces the right of the collector. Such was the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of the United States v. Morris, 10 Wheat. 246. Ibid.
But whatever is reserved to the government out of the forfeiture, is reserved as well for the seizing officer, as for itself; and is distributable accordingly. The government has no authority, under its existing laws, to release the collector's share, as such, and yet to retain to itself the other part of the forfeiture. Ibid.
In point of law, no duties, as such, can legally accrue upon the importation of prohibited goods. They are not entitled to entry at the custom-house, or to be bonded. They are, ipso facto, forfeited by the mere act of importation. Ibid.
The Secretary of the Treasury inay remit not only the interest of the United States, but of individuals, in penalties and forfeitures in certain cases, after suit brought, and before judgment. United States v. Lancaster, 4 Wash. C. C. R. 64.
A pardon of the President of the United States, after condemnation , as to all the interest of the United States, in the penalty incurred by a violation of the embargo laws, and directing all further proceedings on behalf of the United States to be discontinued , does not remit the interest of the customhouse officers in a moiety. Ibid.
Under the 91st section of the duty act of March 2d , 1799, ch. 22, the share of a forfeiture to which the collector, &c . , of the district is entitled, is to be paid to the person who was the collector, &c., in the office at the time the seizure was made ; and not to his successor in office at the time of condemnation, and the receipt of the money. Buel v. Van Ness , 8 Wheat. 312 ; 5 Cond. Rep . 445.
Until final judgment, no part of the forfeiture vests absolutely in the collector ; but after final judgment, his share vests absolutely, and cannot be remitted by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Hollen, 1 Mason's C. C. R. 431.
If, pending the proceedings, a remission be made of the whole property forfeited, the whole title of

If there is no informer, the United States have one-half, and the officers of the customs the other. If there is an informer, the informer has a fourth, and the custom-house officers a fourth. Ifthe informer
is an officer of a revenue cutter, the United States have a fourth, one-fourth to the custom-house officers, and the officer of the revenue cutter one-half. Sawyer et al. v. Steele , 3 Wash. C. C. R. 464.
The consent of the claimants that the vessel should be sent into another district for adjudication, or a disavowal by them of having instituted the suit, does not amount to a waiver by them, of their right to a share of the forfeiture. Ibid.
But the collector is not responsible for such part of the forfeiture as he may have paid over, bona fide, to other officers, for their shares, before notice of the plaintiff's claim. Ibid.
The Secretary of the Treasury has no power to remit penalties, unless in cases provided for by law. If he recites his authority under a special act , and remits in pursuance of that act, the remission , if unsupported by that act, cannot be supported under the general act of March 3, 1797 , ch. 13. Under the act of February 27, 1813 , ch. 33, the Secretary of the Treasury had no authority to remit penalties for goods subsequently imported, contrary to the non-importation act. Under the act of March
3, 1797, ch. 13, the district judge is bound , upon a petition for remission, to state the facts, and not merely the evidence of the facts ; and the Secretary of the Treasury is bound by this statement of facts, and cannot legally act upon any other evidence . The Margaretta, 2 Gallis . C. C. R. 515.
The district judge , in stating such facts, acts judicially ; and the proof before him must be made by competent, as well as credible testimony. A statement by the district judge that the claimant only swore to the facts before him, is no legal proof under the act of 1797, upon which the Secretary ofthe Treasury is authorized to remit. Under the act of February 27, 1813, ch. 33, the Secretary of the Treasury had no authority to make a remission of part only of the property forfeited ; if he remitted at all, he was bound to remit the whole penalty or forfeiture. Neither under the act of 1797 , nor the act of 1813, had the Secretary of the Treasury any authority to remit the collector's share of the forfeiture, nor any part of it, eo nomine. Ibid.
Fines imposed by the act of March 2 , 1799, ch. 22 , for obstructing officers of the customs, as well as penalties, are to be received by the collector of the customs, and distributed by him. Ex parte Marquand, 2 Gallis. C. C. R. 552.

Aldridge and others v. Williams, 3 Howard, 9.
The provisions ofthe act of 1833 , by which duties were to be levied , after June 1 , 1842 , on the home valuation, " under such regulations as may be prescribed by law," comprehended all the regulations existing under the law at the time when the duties, according to the home valuation , accrued . The regulations established by the 7th and 8th sections of the act of 1832 , were, after the compromise act expired, in force, and were sufficient for the collection of duties after June 1 , 1842. Ibid.
The 9th section of the act of 1832, makes it the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury, under the direction of the President, to establish, when necessary, rules and regulations to secure a just, faithful ,
and impartial appraisal of merchandise, and just and proper entries of them. It is very clear that any regulations within the authority thus given, are regulations prescribed by law. Ibid.
In expounding this law, the judgment of the court cannot, in any degree, be influenced by the construction placed upon it by individual members of Congress, in the debate which took place on its passage ; nor bythe motives or reasons assigned by them for supporting or opposing amendments offered. The law, as it passed , is the will of a majority of both houses, and the only mode in which this will is spoken , is in the act itself; and we must gather their intention from the language there used , comparing it, where any ambiguity exists, with laws upon the same subject ; and looking, if necessary, to the public history of the times in which it was passed.

The United States v. Gear, 3 Howard, 120.
The act does not require the President to cause the land containing lead mines to be sold, as the fifth section ofthe act of March 3, 1807 , entitled " An act making provision for the disposal of the public lands, situated between the United States' tract and the Connecticut reserve, and for other purposes, " is in full force. Ibid.
The lands containing lead mines, in the Indiana territory , or that part of it made into the new land districts, bythe act of June 26th, 1834, are not subject to a pre-emption by settlers upon the public lands, under any of the pre-emption laws which have been passed by Congress. Ibid.
The fourth section of the act of 1834 does in no way repeal any part of the fifth section of the act of March 3, 1807, ch. 49, by which the lands containing lead mines were reserved for the future disposal ofthe United States, in which section it is declared that grants for lead mine tracts, discovered to be such before they may be bought from the United States, are declared to be fraudulent and null ; and which authorized the President to lease any lead mine which had been, or might be discovered in the Indiana territory, for a term not exceeding five years. Ibid.
The land containing lead mines, in the districts made by the act of 1834, are not subject to pre-emption and sale under any of the existing acts of Congress. Ibid.
Digging lead ore from the lead mines upon the public land of the United States, is such a waste as entitles the United States to a writ of injunction to restrain it. Ibid.

(a) See notes of acts which have been passed relative to pre-emption of public lands , vol . iv. p . 420. (b) The decisions of the Supreme Court upon the compacts between states have been :The compact of 1789, between Virginia and Kentucky, was valid under that provision of the constitution which declares, that " no state shall , without the consent of Congress, enter into agreement or compact with another state, or with a foreign power:" no particular mode, in which that consent must be given, having been prescribed by the constitution ; and Congress having consented to the admission of Kentucky into the Union, as a sovereign state , upon the conditions in the compact. Green v. Biddle, 8 Wheat. 1 ; 5 Cond. Rep. 369. The compact is not invalid upon the ground of its surrendering rights of sovereignty, which are inalienable. Ibid.
To bring a case within the protection of the seventh article in the compact between Virginia and Kentucky, it must be shown that the title to the land asserted , is derived from the laws of Virginia, prior to the separation of the two states. Lessee of Fisher v. Cockerell , 5 Peters, 248.
The construction of a compact between the states of Virginia and Pennsylvania, is not to be settled by the laws or decisions of either of those states, but by the compact itself. Marlatt v. Silk et al ., 11 Peters, 1 .
The decision of a question of the construction of such a compact, is not to be attested from the decisions of either state, but is one of an international character. Ibid.
It is a part of the general right of sovereignty, belonging to independent nations, to establish and fix the disputed boundaries between the respective limits ; and the boundaries so established and fixed by compact between nations, become conclusive upon all the subjects and citizens thereof, and bind their rights ; and are to be treated , to all intents and purposes, as the real boundaries. This right is expressly recognised to exist in the states of the Union , by the constitution of the United States ; and is guarded in its exercise by a single limitation or restriction , only, requiring the consent of Congress. Ibid.
The compact between New Jersey and Pennsylvania, recognises the right of fishery in riparian owners on the Delaware. Bennet v. Boggs, Baldwin's C. C. R. 60.
The plaintiffs, in the circuit court of West Tennessee, instituted an ejectment for a tract of land held under  Virginia military land warrant, situate south of a line called Mathews' line , and south of Walker's line ; the latter being the established boundaries between the states of Kentucky and Tennes see, as fixed by a compact between those states , made in 1820 ; by which compact, although the jurisdiction over the territory to the south of Walker's line , was acknowledged to belong to Tennessee, the titles to lands held under Virginia military land warrants , &c. ; and grants from Kentucky, as far south as " Mathews' line," were declared to be confirmed : the state of Kentucky having , before the com-

of New Jersey, for the purpose of agreeing upon and settling the jurisdiction and territorial limits of the two states, have executed certain
articles, which are contained in the words following, viz :
Agreement made and entered into by and between Benjamin F. Butler,
Peter Augustus Jay and Henry Seymour, commissioners duly appointed
on the part and behalf of the state of New York, in pursuance of an act 66
of the legislature of the said state, entitled An act concerning the ter-

ritorial limits and jurisdiction of the state of New York and the state of New Jersey, passed January 18th, 1833, of the one part ; and Theodore Frelinghuysen, James Parker, and Lucius Q. C. Elmer, commissioners duly appointed on the part and behalf of the state of New Jersey, in pursuance of an act of the legislature of the said state, entitled " An

act for the settlement of the territorial limits and jurisdiction between the states of New Jersey and New York," passed February 6th, 1833, of the other part.
ARTICLE FIRST. The boundary line between the two states of New York and New Jersey, from a point in the middle of Hudson river, opposite the point on the west shore thereof, in the forty-first degree of north latitude, as heretofore ascertained and marked , to the main sea, shall be the middle of the said river, of the Bay of New York, of the waters between Staten Island and New Jersey, and of Raritan Bay, to the main sea ; except as hereinafter otherwise particularly mentioned.
ARTICLE SECOND. The state of New York shall retain its present jurisdiction of and over Bedlow's and Ellis's islands ; and shall also retain exclusive jurisdiction of and over the other islands lying in the waters above mentioned and now under the jurisdiction of that state.
ARTICLE THIRD. The state of New York shall have and enjoy exclusive jurisdiction of and over all the waters of the bay of New York ; and of and over all the waters of Hudson river lying west of Manhattan Island

pact, claimed the right to the soil, as well as the jurisdiction over the territory, and having granted lands in the same. The compact of 1820 was confirmed by Congress. The defendants in the ejectment
claimed the lands under titles emanating from the state of North Carolina, in 1786, 1794, 1795 ; before the formation of the state of Tennessee ; and grants from the state of Tennessee , in 1809 , 1811 , 1812 , 1814, in which the lands claimed by the defendants were situated , according to the boundary of the state ofTennessee , declared and established at a time when the state of Tennessee became one ofthe states of the United States. The circuit court instructed the jury that the state of Tennessee , by sanctioning the compact, admitted, in the most solemn form, that the lands in dispute were not within her jurisdiction, nor within the jurisdiction of North Carolina, at the time they were granted ; and that, consequently, the titles are subject to the compact : Held , by the Supreme Court, that the instructions of the circuit court were entirely correct. Poole v. Fleeger, 11 Peters , 185.
The seventh article of the compact between Virginia and Kentucky declares " all private rights and interests of lands within the said district (Kentucky,) derived from the laws of Virginia, prior to such separation, shall remain valid and secure under the laws ofthe proposed state , and shall be determined by the laws now existing in this state (Virginia) . " Whatever course of legislation , by Kentucky, would be sanctioned by the principles and practice of Virginia, should be regarded as an unaffected compliance with the compact. Such are all reasonable quieting statutes. Hawkins v. Barney's Lessee, 5 Peters , 457 .
From as early a date as the year 1705, Virginia has never been without an act of limitation ; and no class oflaws is more universally sanctioned by the practice of nations, and the consent of mankind, than those laws which give peace and confidence to the actual possessor and tiller of the soil. Such laws have frequently passed in review before the Supreme Court ; and occasions have occurred in which they have been particularly noticed , as laws not to be impeached on the ground of violating private rights. It is impossible to take any reasonable exception to the course of legislation pursued by Kentucky on this subject. She has in fact literally complied with the compact in its most rigid construction. For she adopted the very statute of Virginia in the first instance , and literally gave her citizens the full benefit of twenty years to prosecute their suits, before she enacted the law now under consideration . As to the exceptions and provisoes, and savings in such statutes, they must necessarily be left, in all cases, to the wisdom or discretion of the legislative power. Ibid.
It is not to be questioned , that laws limiting the time of bringing suits constitute a part of the lex fori of every country ; the laws for administering justice, one of the most sacred and important of sovereign rights and duties, and a restriction upon which must materially affect both legislative and judicial independence. It can scarcely be supposed that Kentucky would have consented to accept a limited and crippled sovereignty ; nor is it doing justice to Virginia to believe that she would have wished to reduce Kentucky to a state of vassalage. Yet it would be difficult, ifthe literal and rigid construction neces- " sary to exclude her from passing the limitation act were adopted , to assign her a position higher than that of a dependent on Virginia. Ibid.
The limitation act of the state of Kentucky, commonly known by the epithet of " the seven years law," does not violate the compact between the state of Virginia and the state of Kentucky. Ibid.

The fifth section of the act of June 30 , 1834, ch. 132, is a repeal of the joint resolution of the two

By force of the army regulation No. 1125, authorizing the issue of double rations to officers command-

The fact of appropriations having been made by Congress for double rations does not determine what officers are entitled to them. Ibid.

A brevet field officer of the marine corps, commanding a separate post, without a command equal to his brevet rank, is not entitled to his brevet pay and emoluments. But if such brevet officer is a captain

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United Construction States of America, in Congress assembled, That the Baltimore and Ohio of road within
the District of Railroad Company be, and they are hereby, authorized to locate and con- Columbia. struct their said road within the city of Washington, through squares nine
hundred and nine, eight hundred and eighty-eight, eight hundred and fifty-eight, eight hundred and thirty-two, nine hundred and eight, eight hundred and eighty-seven, eight hundred and fifty-six, eight hundred and fifty-seven, eight hundred and thirty-one, eight hundred and seven , seven hundred and seventy-six, seven hundred and fifty-one, seven hundred and eighteen, in the same manner, and with the same rights and privileges which are granted to them by the act to which this is a supplement, for the construction of their said road within the District of Columbia, beyond the
limits of the city of Washington , any thing in the said act contained to
the contrary notwithstanding, and the assent of Congress is hereby given to the construction of the said railroad through or over any of the said
lots or parts of lots which are owned by the United States.

(a) The following decision of the Supreme Court is introduced , as it is one of the occasions in which the Baltimore and Ohio railroad has been the subject ofthe legislation of Congress.
The state of Maryland , in 1836 , passed a law directing a subscription of three millions of dollars to be made to the capital stock ofthe Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, with the following proviso, " that
if the said company shall not locate the said road in the manner provided in this act, then and in that case,they shall forfeit one million of dollars to the state ofMaryland, for the use ofWashington county." In March, 1840, the state passed another act, repealing so much ofthe prior act as made it the duty of the company to construct the road by the route therein prescribed, remitting and releasing the penalty, and directing the discontinuance of any suit brought to recover the same. Held, that the proviso was
a measure of state policy, which it had a right to change, if that policy was afterwards discovered to be erroneous ; and neither the commissioners, nor the county, nor any one of its citizens, acquired any separate or private interest under it, which could be maintained in a court of justice. State of Maryland v. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, 3 Howard, 534.
It was a penalty, intended to be imposed on the company for disobeying the law ; and the assent of the company to it, as a supplemental charter, was not sufficient to deprive it of the character ofa penalty. Ibid.
A clause of forfeiture in a law is to be construed differently from a similar clause in an engagement between individuals. A legislature can impose it as a punishment ; but individuals can only make it a matter ofcontract. Being a penalty, imposed by law, the legislature had a right to remit it. Ibid.

Where there is a deviation from the voyage in the shipping articles, a refusal of the seamen, subsequently, to do duty on that account, does not amount in law to an endeavour to commit a revolt, under the act of Congress of 1835, ch. 40, sec . 2. United States v. John Mathews, 2 Sumner's C. C. R. 470. To sustain an indictment for an endeavour to make a revolt, under the act of Congress of 1835, ch. 40, sec. 2, a confederacy or combination must be shown, between two or more ofthe seamen, to refuse to do further duty on board of the ship, and to resist the lawful commands of the officers. The United States v. Alfred Cassedy et al. , 2 Sumner's C. C. R. 582. The contract of seamen for the voyage is not suspended or extinguished by the death, removal , or resignation of the original master ; but they are bound to perform the voyage under any person who is lawfully substituted in his place .

to any other person not lawfully entitled thereto, every such person so

offending, his aiders or abettors, shall be deemed guilty of a revolt or

their proper duty on board thereof, or to betray their proper trust therein, or shall assemble with others in a tumultuous and mutinous manner, or

make a riot on board thereof, or shall unlawfully confine the master, or

on conviction thereof, be punished by fine, not exceeding one thousand

The act of 1835, ch. 40 , provides, " That if any one or more ofthe crew of an American ship or vessel on the high seas, &c. , shall endeavour to make a revolt, &c. , he and they shall be punished as provided in the act." Held , that a ship engaged in a whaling voyage, without having surrendered her register, or taken out an enrolment and license pursuant to the act of 1793, ch. 8, was not an American ship, within the purview of the act of 1835, ch. 40, and that an indictment would not hold, under this act, against the crew, for an endeavour to make a revolt. The United States v. Rogers, 3 Sumner's C. C. R. 342.
(a) The act of Congress of 1835, ch . 40, sec. 3, for the punishment of certain maritime offences, provides, " that if any master or other officer of an American ship orvessel shall , from malice, hatred, or revenge , and without justifiable cause , beat, wound or imprison any one or more of the crew of such ship or vessel," &c. , he shall be punished in the manner stated in the act. Held, that " malice," in the sense of the act, signified wilfulness, or a wilful intention to do a wrongful act, and that to authorize a conviction under this act, two things must be shown : first, malice , or hatred , or revenge ; and, secondly, a want of justifiable cause to inflict the injury. United States v. Otis Taylor, 2 Sumner's C, C. R. 584.
The master, when on board, has generally the sole authority to authorize punishment to be inflicted on any of the crew, and if he is present when punishment is inflicted by a subordinate officer, and can prevent it, and does not, he is personally responsible for the act ; and neither the mate nor any subordinate officer has authority to punish any seaman, even for improper behaviour to himself personally, when the master is on board , except by authority, express or implied, by the master, or when the necessities of the service require instantaneous punishment, as by blows or otherwise, to compel a seaman to his duty. Ibid.
In the absence of the master, the next highest officer on board succeeds to his right and authority, pro tempore, so far as they are necessary for the due performance of the ship's duties. Ibid.

act. For the collection of which tolls, the president and directors shall have power to establish so many toll-houses, and at their pleasure to appoint and remove so many collectors, and at such places as from time to time they may judge expedient ; and the said president and directors shall have full authority, subject to the direction and control of a majority in interest of the stock-

holders represented in any general meeting, to regulate and fix a tariff of tolls, not exceeding an average of two cents per ton per mile ; and so to adjust the

said tolls, in relation to the capacity or burden of the boats, and the dimensions of the rafts passing the locks of the said canal, as to promote economy of water and time in the navigation thereof.

Dividends.

from the necessary current, and the probable contingent expenses, to be divided among the proprietors of the stock of the said company, in proportion to their respective shares, in manner following ; that is to say if such net profits shall not exceed ten per cent. on the amount of shares, which shall have been paid for in current money of the United States, and expended on the eastern section of the said canal, then the whole thereof shall be divided among the

holders of such shares, in proportion to their respective shares ; but, if such net profits shall exceed the rate of ten per cent. per annum in any year, on such amount of stock, then the surplus shall be divided among such stock-

holders as shall have paid for their shares in certificates of the debts of the Potowmac Company, until they shall therefrom have received a dividend of

six per cent.; and, if a surplus yet remain, the same shall be divided among the stockholders who shall have paid for their shares in certificates of the stock of the Potowmac Company, until they shall have received therefrom a dividend of six per cent. per annum on such shares ; and if a surplus still remain, so long as the western section of the canal shall remain unfinished, such surplus shall be applied , from time to time, to the construction and completion thereof, in such mode as the president and directors, under such rules and regulations, not inconsistent with the constitution of the United States ,

or of the several states aforesaid, as the stockholders, or a majority thereof, in general meeting, may prescribe, until the western section of the canal shall be

also completed ; after which, if such surplus shall still arise, the same shall be divided among all the stockholders, without discrimination, in proportion to their respective shares, until the annual dividend thereon shall have reached fifteen per cent., beyond which it shall never extend. But should the net revenue of the company exceed that amount for any two years in succession, then such excess shall be applied, by the president and directors, in such mode as shall be agreed on by a majority of the stockholders convened in

general meeting ; first, to strengthening and improving the works of the canal of every description requiring the same ; next, to the accommodation, where not already provided , of the inhabitants of the shores of the river Potowmac, and of the country drained by the tributary streams thereof, now navigable, or which may hereafter become so, by affording to them , in the best practical mode, a safe and easy access to the canal, from the surface of the main river, and of the said streams emptying therein ; and, last of all, to the erection of such walls of stone or other materials, along the water margin of the canal, as shall fit the same for the navigation of steamboats of a size adapted to the said canal. And should the said tolls continue, after all such improvements have been completed, to net more than fifteen per cent. per annum to the

stockholders for any two years in succession, the tolls upon the same shall be reduced, by the president and directors, according to some just and equitable ratio, till the said dividend shall fall to fifteen per cent. per annum : Provided, That, should the said dividend thereafter sink below fifteen per cent. , the said tolls, or a part thereof, may be renewed, till the said net dividend reaches that amount. And for any, or all the within-mentioned purposes, the said

president and directors are empowered to borrow, in behalf of the company, on the credit of such excess of tolls, such sum or sums of money as they

may deem expedient, at such rate of interest, and with such delay of payment,

as they may stipulate, with the previous consent of a majority of the stock-

holders in general meeting convened.

thereupon the charter of the said Potowmac Company shall be, and the same is hereby vacated and annulled, and all the rights and powers thereby

granted to the Potowmac Company shall be vested in the company hereby

incorporated ; and it shall be the duty of the said last mentioned company, until every section of the contemplated canal shall be completed , so as to be

used and enjoyed for the purposes of navigation, to keep the corresponding part of the river in a proper state for navigation, and in good order as the

same now is ; and in default thereof, they shall be in all things responsible,

in the same manner as the Potowmac Company is now responsible. And in all rivulets , streams, creeks, and rivers, required for the western section of the

said Chesapeake and Ohio canal, the same rights shall be, and are hereby,

of his skill and judgment, and that in such valuation he will not spare any

person for favour or affection, nor any person grieve for malice, hatred, or ill
