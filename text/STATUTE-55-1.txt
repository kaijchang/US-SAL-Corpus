"(1 ) By computing, for each of the taxable years of the taxpayer in its base period, the excess profits net income for such

year, or the deficit in excess profits net income for such year ; "(2) By computing for each half of the base period the aggre-
gate of the excess profits net income for each of the taxable

years in such half, reduced , if for one or more of such years there was a deficit in excess profits net income, by the sum of such deficits. For the purposes of such computation , if any taxable year is partly within each half of the base period there shall be allocated to the first half an amount of the excess profits net income or deficit in excess profits net income, as the case may be, for such taxable year, which bears the same ratio thereto as the number of months falling within such half bears to the entire number of months in such taxable year ; and the remainder shall be allocated to the second half;
"(3) If the amount ascertained under paragraph ( 2 ) for the second half is greater than the amount ascertained for the first half, by dividing the difference by two ;
"(4) By adding the amount ascertained under paragraph ( 3 ) to the amount ascertained under paragraph (2 ) for the second half of the base period ;

"(5) By dividing the amount found under paragraph (4) by the number of months in the second half of the base period and by multiplying the result by twelve ;
"(6) The amount ascertained under paragraph (5 ) shall be the average base period net income determined under this subsection, except that the average base period net income determined under this subsection shall in no case be greater than

For the purpose of such limitation if any taxable year is of less than twelve months, the excess profits net income for such taxable year shall be placed on an annual basis by multiplying by twelve and dividing by the number of months included in such taxable year.
"(7) For the purposes of this subsection, the excess profits net income for any taxable year ending after May 31 , 1940, shall not be greater than an amount computed as follows :
(A) By reducing the excess profits net income by an amount which bears the same ratio thereto as the number
of months after May 31, 1940, bears to the total number of
months in such taxable year ; and "(B) By adding to the amount ascertained under sub-
paragraph (A) an amount which bears the same ratio to the excess profits net income for the last preceding taxable year as such number of months after May 31, 1940, bears to the number of months in such preceding year. The amount added under this subparagraph shall not exceed the amount of the excess profits net income for such last preceding taxable year.
"(C) If the number of months in such preceding taxable year is less than such number of months after May 31 , 1940,
by adding to the amount ascertained under subparagraph ( B) an amount which bears the same ratio to the excess profits net income for the second preceding taxable year as the excess of such number of months after May 31 , 1940, over the number of months in such preceding taxable year bears to the number of months in such second preceding taxable year."

income of any class includible in the gross income of the taxpayer for any taxable year under this subchapter if it is abnormal for the taxpayer to derive income of such class, or, if the taxpayer normally derives income of such class but the amount of such income of such class includible in the gross income of the taxable year is in excess of 125 per centum of the average amount of the gross income of the same class for the four previous taxable years, or, if the taxpayer was not in existence for four previous taxable years, the taxable years during which the taxpayer was in existence.
" (2 ) SEPARATE CLASSES OF INCOME.- Each of the following subparagraphs shall be held to describe a separate class of income :
"(A ) Income arising out of a claim, award , judgment, or decree, or interest on any of the foregoing ; or

"(b) AMOUNT ATTRIBUTABLE TO OTHER YEARS.-The amount of the net abnormal income that is attributable to any previous or future taxable year or years shall be determined under regulations prescribed by the Commissioner with the approval of the Secretary. In the case of amounts otherwise attributable to future taxable years, if the taxpayer either transfers substantially all its properties or distributes any property in complete liquidation, then there shall be attributable to the first taxable year in which such transfer or distribution occurs (or if such year is previous to the taxable year in which the abnormal income is includible in gross income, to such latter taxable year ) all amounts so attributable to future taxable years not included in the gross income of a previous taxable year.

"(1) The tax under this subchapter for such taxable year computed without the inclusion in gross income of the portion of the net abnormal income which is attributable to any other taxable year, and
" (2) The aggregate of the increase in the tax under this subchapter which would have resulted for each previous taxable year to which any portion of such net abnormal income is attributable, computed as if an amount equal to such portion had been included in the gross income for such previous taxable year.

53 Stat. 471, 462.
26 U. S. C. §§ 3801, 3761.

If in a subsequent determination of the tax under this

subchapter for such taxable year such inconsistent treatment is not adopted, then the correction shall not be made in connection

with such subsequent determination.
"(2 ) Such adjustment shall be made only if there is adopted in the determination a position maintained by the Commissioner (in case the net effect of the adjustment would be a decrease in the income taxes previously determined for such year or years ) or by the taxpayer with respect to whom the determination is made (in case the net effect of the adjustment would be an increase in the income taxes previously determined for such year or years) which position is inconsistent with the treatment accorded such item in the prior taxable year or years which was not correct under the law applicable to such year.
"(c) METHOD AND EFFECT OF ADJUSTMENT.- ( 1 ) The adjustment authorized by subsection (b) , in the amount ascertained as provided in subsection ( d ) , if a net increase shall be added to, and if a net decrease shall be subtracted from, the tax otherwise computed under this subchapter for the taxable year with respect to which such inconsistent position is adopted.
"(2) If more than one adjustment under this section is made. because more than one inconsistent position is adopted with respect to one taxable year under this subchapter, the separate adjustments, each an amount ascertained as provided in subsection (d ) , shall be
aggregated, and the aggregate net increase or decrease shall be added to or subtracted from the tax otherwise computed under this subchapter for the taxable year with respect to which such inconsistent positions are adopted.
"(3) If all the adjustments under this section, made on account of the adoption of an inconsistent position or positions with respect to one taxable year under this subchapter, result in an aggregate net increase, the tax imposed by this subchapter shall in no case be less than the amount of such aggregate net increase.
"(d) ASCERTAINMENT OF AMOUNT OF ADJUSTMENT.- In computing the amount of an adjustment under this section there shall first be ascertained the amount of the income taxes previously determined for each of the prior taxable years for which correction is prevented. The amount of each such tax previously determined for each such taxable year shall be ( 1 ) the tax shown by the taxpayer, or by the predecessor , upon the return for such prior taxable year, increased by the amounts previously assessed ( or collected without assessment ) as deficiencies , and decreased by the amounts previously abated, credited, refunded, or otherwise repaid in respect of such tax ; or (2 ) if no amount was shown as the tax by such taxpayer or such predecessor upon the return, or if no return was made by such taxpayer or such predecessor, then the amounts previously assessed (or collected without assessment ) as deficiencies, but such amounts

previously assessed , or collected without assessment, shall be decreased by the amounts previously abated , credited, refunded, or otherwise

repaid in respect of such tax. There shall then be ascertained the increase or decrease in each such tax previously determined for each such year which results solely from the treatment of the item consistently with the treatment accorded such item in the determination of the tax liability under this subchapter. To the increase or decrease so ascertained for each such tax for each such year there shall be added interest thereon computed as if the increase or decrease constituted a deficiency or an overpayment, as the case may be, for such prior taxable year. There shall be ascertained the difference between the aggregate of such increases, plus the interest attributable to each, and the aggregate of such decreases, plus the interest attributable to each, and the net increase or decrease so ascertained shall be the amount of the adjustment under this section with respect to the inconsistent treatment of such item.

52 Stat. 62. 13756U. . S. C. §§§ 1351-

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That title III of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, as amended , is amended by inserting after part V of subtitle B thereof the following new part :

"PART VI- MARKETING QUOTAS-PEANUTS

"LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS

" SEC. 357. The production, marketing, and processing of peanuts and peanut products employs a large number of persons and is of national interest. The movement of peanuts from producer to consumer is preponderantly in interstate and foreign commerce, and, owing to causes beyond their control, the farmers producing such commodity and the persons engaged in the marketing and processing thereof are unable to regulate effectively the orderly marketing of the commodity. As the quantity of peanuts marketed in the channels of interstate and foreign commerce increases above the quantity of peanuts needed for cleaning and shelling, the prices at which all peanuts are marketed are depressed to low levels. These low prices tend to cause the quantity of peanuts available for marketing in later years to be less than normal, which in turn tends to cause relatively high prices. This fluctuation of prices and marketings of peanuts creates an unstable and chaotic condition in the marketing of peanuts for cleaning and shelling and for crushing for oil in the channels of interstate and foreign commerce. Since these unstable and chaotic conditions have existed for a period of years and are
likely, without proper regulation , to continue to exist, it is imperative that the marketing of peanuts for cleaning and shelling and for crushing for oil in interstate and foreign commerce be regulated in order to protect producers, handlers, processors, and consumers.

"MARKETING QUOTAS

Annual proclama-

tion .

"SEC. 358. ( a ) Between July 1 and December 1 of each calendar

year the Secretary shall proclaim the amount of the national market-

ing quota for peanuts for the crop produced in the next succeeding

calendar year in terms of the total quantity of peanuts which will

make available for marketing a supply of peanuts from the crop

with respect to which the quota is proclaimed equal to the average

quantity of peanuts harvested for nuts during the five years immedi-

ately preceding the year in which such quota is proclaimed , adjusted

for current trends and prospective demand conditions, and the quota National acreage al- so proclaimed shall be in effect with respect to such crop. The lotment.
national marketing quota for peanuts for any year shall be converted

to a national acreage allotment by dividing such quota by the normal

yield per acre of peanuts for the United States determined by the

Secretary on the basis of the average yield per acre of peanuts in

the five years preceding the year in which the quota is proclaimed ,

with such adjustments as may be found necessary to correct for

trends in yields and for abnormal conditions of production affecting yields in such five years : Provided, That the national marketing quota established for the crop produced in the calendar year 1941 shall be a

quantity of peanuts sufficient to provide a national acreage allotment

of not less than one million six hundred and ten thousand acres, and

55 STAT. ]

77TH CONG., 1ST SESS.- CH, 39-APR. 3, 1941

89

that the national marketing quota established for any subsequent year shall be quantity of peanuts sufficient to provide a national acre-

age allotment of not less than 95 per centum of that established for

the crop produced in the calendar year 1941. "(b) Not later than December 15 of each calendar year the Secre-

Referendum .

tary shall conduct a referendum of farmers engaged in the production of peanuts in the calendar year in which the referendum is held

to determine whether such farmers are in favor of or opposed to

marketing quotas with respect to the crops of peanuts produced in the three calendar years immediately following the year in which the

referendum is held, except that, if as many as two-thirds of the

farmers voting in any referendum vote in favor of marketing quotas, no referendum shall be held with respect to quotas for the second

and third years of the period. The Secretary shall proclaim the results of the referendum within thirty days after the date on which

it is held , and, if more than one-third of the farmers voting in the

referendum vote against marketing quotas, the Secretary also shall proclaim that marketing quotas will not be in effect with respect to the crop of peanuts produced in the calendar year immediately follow-

ing the calendar year in which the referendum is held. Notwith-

standing any other provisions of this section, the Secretary shall proclaim a national marketing quota with respect to the crop of peanuts

produced in the calendar year 1941 equal to the minimum quota provided for said year in subsection (a) hereof and shall provide for

the holding of a referendum on such quota within thirty days after the date upon which this Act becomes effective, and the State and

farm acreage allotments established under the 1941 agricultural conservation program shall be the State and farm acreage allotments for the 1941 crop of peanuts.
"(c) The national acreage allotment shall be apportioned among States on the basis of the average acreage of peanuts harvested for nuts in the five years preceding the year in which the national allotment is determined , with adjustments for trends, abnormal conditions of production, and the State peanut-acreage allotment for the  immediately preceding the crop for which the allotment hereunder is established : Provided, That the allotment established for any State for any year subsequent to 1941 shall be not less than 95 per centum of the allotment established for such State for the crop pro-

duced in the calendar year 1941 : Provided further, That for the second or third year of any three-year period in which marketing quotas are in effect the acreage allotment for each State for such year shall be increased above or decreased below the allotment for the State for

the immediately preceding year by the same percentage as the national marketing quota for such year is increased above or decreased below the national marketing quota for the preceding year.
"(d) The Secretary shall provide for apportionment of the State acreage allotment for any State through local committees among farms on which peanuts were grown in any of the three years immediately preceding the year for which such allotment is determined . Such
apportionment shall be made on the basis of the tillable acreage available for the production of peanuts and the past acreage of peanuts on

The amount of the marketing quota for each farm shall be the actual production of the farm-acreage allotment, and no peanuts shall be marketed under the quota for any farm other than peanuts actually produced on the farm.

Penalty.

"SEC. 359. (a) The marketing of any peanuts in excess of the marketing quota for the farm on which such peanuts are produced, or the marketing of peanuts from any farm for which no acreage allotment was determined , shall be subject to a penalty of 3 cents per pound, except as provided in subsection (b) of this section. Such

penalty shall be paid by the person who buys or otherwise acquires the peanuts from the producer, or, if the peanuts are marketed by

the producer through an agent, the penalty shall be paid by such agent, and such person or agent may deduct an amount equivalent to

the penalty from the price paid to the producer. The Secretary may require collection of the penalty upon a portion of each lot of peanuts marketed from the farm equal to the proportion which the acreage of peanuts in excess of the farm-acreage allotment is of the total

acreage of peanuts on the farm. If the person required to collect

tioDnesp.osit of collec

the penalty fails to collect such penalty, such person and all persons entitled to share in the peanuts marketed from the farm or the proceeds thereof shall be jointly and severally liable for the amount of the penalty. All funds collected pursuant to this section shall be deposited in a special deposit account with the Treasurer of the United

States and such amounts as are determined, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, to be penalties incurred shall be transferred to the general fund of the Treasury of the United States. Amounts collected in excess of determined penalties shall

Such special account shall be administered by the Secretary and the basis for, the amount of, and the producer entitled to receive a payment from such account , when determined in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, shall be final and conclusive. If, in the course of marketing, any peanuts
produced on one farm are falsely identified by a representation that such peanuts were produced on another farm, or, if there is a failure to make a report of the disposition of peanuts available for marketing from any farm, each person participating in the false identification

"(b) Payment of the penalty of 3 cents per pound upon the marketing of peanuts as provided in subsection (a) above will not be required if such excess peanuts are delivered to and marketed through an agency or agencies designated each year by the Secretary. Any peanuts received under this subsection by such agency shall be sold by such agency for crushing for oil under a sales agreement
approved by the Secretary, or for cleaning and shelling at prices not less than those established under any peanut-diversion or peanutloan program operated by the Secretary. For all peanuts so

conservation program : Provided further, That for the marketing year beginning in 1941, there shall be no marketing penalty on wheat with respect to any such nonallotment farm if the acreage of wheat harvested on the farm is not in excess of the usual acreage determined for the farm under the 1941 agricultural conservation program and the county committee determines, in accordance with regulations of the Secretary, that there will not be marketed an amount of wheat in excess of the 1941 farm marketing quota.
(8) Until the farm marketing excess of corn or wheat , as the case may be, is stored or delivered to the Secretary or the penalty thereon is paid, each bushel of the commodity produced on the farm which is sold by the producer to any person within the United States shall be subject to the penalty as specified in paragraph ( 2 ) of this resolution. Such penalty shall be paid by the buyer, who may deduct an amount equivalent to the penalty from the price paid to the producer.
(9) The marketing penalty for cotton and rice produced in the calendar year in which any marketing year begins ( if beginning with or after the 1941-1942 marketing year) shall be at a rate equal to 50 per centum of the basic rate of the loan for cooperators for such marketing year under section 302 of the Act and this resolution.
(10) The Commodity Credit Corporation is directed to make available upon the 1941 crop of the commodities cotton, corn, wheat, rice, or tobacco, for which producers have not disapproved marketing quotas for the marketing year beginning in 1941, loans as follows :
(a) To cooperators (except cooperators outside the commercial corn-producing area, in the case of corn ) at the rate of 85 per centum of the parity price for the commodity as of the beginning of the marketing year ;
