improperly granted. Sec . 4. That all applications for pensions of the classes provided for

PROCLAMATIONS.

Appointing Thursday, November 29, 1877, Thanksgiving Day.

in all that touches the permanence and security of our government, and

the beneficent institutions on which it rests ; in all that affects the character and dispositions of our people, and tests our capacity to enjoy and uphold the equal and free condition of society, now permanent and

universal throughout the land, the experience of the last year is conspicuously marked by the protecting providence of God, and is full of

promise and hope for the coming generations. Under a sense of these infinite obligations to the great Euler of times
and seasons and events, let us humbly ascribe it to our own faults and frailties if, in any degree, that perfect concord and happiness, peace and justice, which such great mercies should diffuse through the hearts and lives of our people, do not altogether and always and everywhere prevail. Let us with one spirit and with one voice lift up praise and thanksgiving to God for his manifold goodness to our land, his manifest care for our nation.

Now, therefore, I, Ruther ford B. Hayes , President of the United States, do appoint Thursday, the twenty-ninth day of November next, as a Day of National Thanksgiving and Prayer; and I earnestly recom-

mend that, withdrawing themselves from secular cares and labors, the people of the United States do meet together on that day in their respective places of worship, there to give thanks and praise to Almighty God for his mercies, and to devoutly beseech their continuance.
In witness whereof 1 have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.

A PROCLAMATION.
Whereas it is provided in the laws of the United States that whenever, by reason of unlawful obstructions, combinations or assemblages of persons, or rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States, it shall become impracticable, in the judgment of the President, to enforce by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings the laws of the United States within any State or Territory, it shall be lawful for the President to call forth the militia of any or all the States, and to employ such parts of the land and naval forces of the United States as he may deem necessary to enforce the faithful execution of the laws of the United States, or to suppress such rebellion, in whatever State or Territory thereof the laws of the United States may be forcibly opposed or the execution thereof forcibly obstructed;
And whereas it has been made to appear to me that by reason of unlawful combinations and assemblages of persons in arms, it has become impracticable to enforce, by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings, the laws of the United States within the Territory of New Mexico, and especially within Lincoln County therein; and that the laws of the United States have been therein forcibly opposed and the execution thereof forcibly resisted;

PROCLAMATIONS.

807

And whereas the laws of the United States require that whenever it may be necessary, in the judgment of the President, to use the military force for the purpose of enforcing the faithful execution of the laws of the United States, he shall forthwith, by proclamation, command such insurgents to disperse and retire peaceably to their respective abodes, within a limited time:
Now, therefore, I, Rutherford B. Hayes, President of the United States do hereby admonish all good citizens of the United States, and especially of the Territory of New Mexico against aiding, countenancing, abetting or taking part in any such unlawful proceedings, and I do hereby warn all persons engaged in or connected with said obstruction of the laws, to disperse and retire peaceably to their respective abodes on or before noon of the thirteenth day of October instant.
In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.

A PROCLAMATION.

The recurrence of that season at which it is the habit of our people to make devout and public confession of their constant dependence upon the Divine favor for all the good gifts of life and happiness and of public peace and prosperity, exhibits, in the record of the year, abundant reasons for our gratitude and thanksgiving.
Exuberant harvests, productive mines, ample crops of the staples of trade and manufactures, have enriched the country.
The resources, thus furnished to our reviving industry and expanding commerce, are hastening the day when discords and distresses, through the length and breadth of the land, will, under the continued favor of Providence, have given way to confidence, and energy and assured pros-
perity. Peace with all nations has been maintained unbroken, domestic tran-
quillity has prevailed, and the institutions of liberty and justice which the wisdom and virtue of our fathers established, remain the glory and defence of their children.
The general prevalence of the blessings of health through our wide land, has made more conspicuous the sufferings and sorrows, which the dark shadow of pestilence has cast upon a portion of our people. This heavy affliction, even, the Divine Ruler has tempered to the suffering communities in the universal sympathy and succor which have flowed to their relief, and the whole nation may rejoice in the unity of spirit in our people by which they cheerfully share one another's burdens.
Now, therefore, I, Rutherford B. Hayes, President of the United States, do appoint Thursday, the 28th day of November, next, as a Day of National Thanksgiving and Prayer; and I earnestly recommend that, withdrawing themselves from secular cares and labors, the people of the United States do meet together on that day in their respective places

3° La simple majorite absolue, s'il s'agit de 1'interpretation des dispositions de la Convention, hors le cas de litige prevu a Particle 17 precedent.
Les resolutions valables sont consacrees, dans les deux premiers cas, par une declaration diplomatique, que le Gouvernement de la Confederation suisse est charge d'etablir et de transmettre tons les Gouvernements des pays contractants, et, dans le troisieme cas, par une simple notification du Bureau international toutes les administrations de I'Union.

In the interval which elapses between the meetings, any Postal Administration of a country of the Union has the right to address to the other Administrations belonging to it, through the intermediary of the International Bureau, proposals concerning the regimen of the Union. But to become executive these propositions must obtain,
as follows: 1st. Unanimity of votes, if they
involve a modification of the stipulations of Articles 2, 3,4, 5,6, and 9 preceding.
2d. Two-thirds of the votes, if they involve a modification of the stipulations of the Convention other than those of Articles 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 9.
3d. A simple absolute majority, if they involve the interpretation of the stipulations of the Convention, except in the case of dispute contemplated in Article 17 preced-
ing. The binding decisions are sanc-
tioned, in the first two cases, by a diplomatic declaration, which the Government of the Swiss Confederation is charged to prepare and transmit to all the Governments of the contracting countries, and, in the third case, by a simple notification from the International Bureau to all the Administrations of the Union.
