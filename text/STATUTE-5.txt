Feb. 17 , 1836. CHAP. XXXVIII.-An Act to incorporate a fire insurance company, in the town of Alexandria, in the District of Columbia.(a)

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives ofthe United

States of America in Congress assembled, That the persons who were

(a) Decisions of the Courts of the United States on Insurance against Fire : Among the conditions which were printed on the same sheet with a policy of insurance against fire, was one requiring " that all persons insured , and sustaining loss or damage by fire, should forthwith give notice thereof to the company, and as soon after as possible deliver in a particular account of such loss or damage, signed with their own hands, and verified with their oath or affirmation , and also, if required , by their books of account and other proper vouchers." Held, that the particular account required by the above condition is a particular account of the articles lost or damaged, and does not refer to the manner and cause of the loss. Catlin v. The Springfield Ins. Co. , 1 Sumner's C. C. R. 434. In stating a loss, it is sufficient to show it to have been occasioned by a peril within the policy , without negativing the exception of losses from design , invasion , public enemies, riots, &c.; which are properly matters of defence. Ibid.
The words in a policy against fire, described the house as " at present occupied as a dwelling- house , but to be occupied hereafter as a tavern , and privileged as such." Held , that this is not a warranty that the house should, during the continuance of the risk , be constantly occupied as a tavern ; but that it is, at farthest, a mere representation of the intention to occupy it as such, and a license or privilege granted by the underwriters that it might be so occupied. Ibid.
Where underwriters agree to make good any loss or damage " by fire originating in any cause, except design in the insured , invasion," & c., held, that the exception of losses by design admits all losses not by design ; that, therefore, where the plaintiff negligently left the premises insured derelict, and intruders came and burnt them, without any co- operation or knowledge on the part of the plaintiff, it is a loss within the policy . Ibid.
The material inquiry is, does the offer for insurance state truly the interest of the assured in the property to be insured ? The offer describes the property as belonging to Lawrence & Poindexter, and states it afterwards to be their stone mill . It contains no qualifying terms , which should lead the mind to suspect that their title was not complete and absolute. The title of the assured was subject to contingencies, and was held under contracts which had become void by the non-performance of the same. The supreme court is of opinion that a precarious title, depending for its continuance on events which might or might not happen, is not such a title as is described in this offer for insurance ; construing the words of that offer as they are fairly to be understood. The Columbian Ins. Co. v. Lawrence , 2 Peters, 48.
The contract for insurance against fire is one in which the underwriter generally acts on the representation of the assured ; and that representation ought consequently to be fair, and to omit nothing which it is material to the underwriter to know. It may not be necessary that the person requiring insurance should state every incumbrance on his property, which it might be required of him to state if it was offered for sale ; but fair dealing requires that he should state everything which might influence the mind of the underwriter in forming or declining the contract. Ibid. 49.

the proprietors of the stock of the late fire insurance company of the town of Alexandria, on the eighth day of March, eighteen hundred and

Certain per-
steodns aisncorapofriar-e insurance company.

The description of the property insured must be such as the property is, and not such as will in any way reduce the rate of the premium. Ibid. , 56.
'The doctrine , as applied to policies against fire on land, has for a great length of time prevailed, that losses occasioned by the mere fault or negligence of the assured, or his servants, unaffected by fraud or design, are within the protection of the policy, and as such are recoverable from the underwriters. This
doctrine is fully established in England and America. Waters v. The Merchants' Louisville Ins. Co. , 11 Peters , 213.
It is a well established principle of the common law, that in all cases of loss we are to attribute it to the proximate cause, and not to the remote cause. This has become a maxim to govern cases arising under policies of insurance. Ibid.
L. & P. atthe time an insurance was made for them against loss by fire, were entitled to one third of the property by deed, and to two thirds as mortgagees ; but one moiety of the whole was held under an agreement which had not been complied with, and which purported on its face to be void, if not complied
with ; but the other contracting party had not declared it void, nor called for a compliance with it. L. & P. had an insurable interest in the property. The Columbian Ins. Co. v. Lawrence, 2 Peters, 46.
That an equitable interest may be insured, is admitted ; and the court perceive no reason which excludes an interest held under an executory contract. While the contract subsists, the person claiming
under it has undoubtedly a substantial interest in the property. If it be destroyed, the loss, in contemplation of law, is his. If the purchase money be paid, it is his in fact. If he owes the purchase money, the property is equivalent, and is still valuable to him. The embarrassment of his affairs may be such that his debts may absorb all his property ; but this circumstance has never been considered as proving a want of interest in it. The destruction of the property is a real loss to the person in possession, who claims title under an executory contract ; and the contingency that his title may be defeated by subsequent events does not prevent this loss. Ibid. 46.
Action on a policy of insurance on the " Glenco Cotton Factory," against loss or damage by fire. The policy was dated the 27th day of September, 1838 , and was to endure for one year. The policy contained a clause by which it was stipulated by the assured , that if any other insurance on the property had been made, and had not been notified to the assurers, and mentioned in or endorsed on the policy, the insurance should be void ; and if afterwards any insurance should be made on the property, and the assured should not give notice of the same to the assurers, and have the same endorsed on the policy, or otherwise acknowledged by the assured in writing, the policy should cease ; and in case any other insurance on the property, prior or subsequent to this policy, should be made, the assured should not, in case of loss, be entitled to recover more than the portion of the loss should bear to the whole amount insured on the property ; the interest of the assured in the property not to be assignable, unless by consent of the assurers, manifested in writing ; and if any sale or transfer of the property without such consent is made, the policy to be void and of no effect. On all the policies of insurance made by the insurance company, there was a printed notice of the conditions on which the insurance was made. The declaration alleged that Carpenter was the owner of the property insured , and was interested in the same to the whole amount insured by the policy ; and that the property had been destroyed by fire. The facts of the case showed that the property had been mortgaged for a part of the purchase money, and the policy of insurance was held for the benefit of the mortgagor. Another insurance was made by another insurance company, but this was not communicated in writing to the Providence Washington Insurance Com-
pany ; nor was the same assented to by them, nor was a memorandum thereof made on the policy. By the Court : No doubt can exist that the mortgagor and the mortgagee may each separately insure his own distinct interest in property against loss by fire. But there is this important distinction between the cases ; that where the mortgagee insures solely on his own account, it is but an insurance of his debt ; and if his debt is afterwards paid or extinguished , the policy ceases from that time to have any operation ; and even if the premises insured are subsequently destroyed by fire, he has no right to recover for the loss, for he sustains no damage thereby ; neither can the mortgagor take advantage of the policy, for he has no interest whatsoever therein : on the other hand, if the premises are destroyed by fire, before any payment or extinguishment of the mortgage , the underwriters are bound to pay the amount of the debt to the mortgagee, if it does not exceed the insurance. Upon such payment, the underwriters are entitled to an assignment of the debt from the mortgagee, and may recover the same from the mortgagor. The payment of the insurance is not a discharge of the debt, but only changes the creditor. Carpenter v. The Providence Washington Insurance Company, 16 Peters, 495.
When the insurance is made by the mortgagor, he will, notwithstanding the mortgage or other encumbrance, be entitled to recover the full amount of his loss, not exceeding the insurance, since the whole loss is his own. The mortgagee can only insure to the amount of his debt ; whereas the mortgagor can insure to the full value of the property, notwithstanding any encumbrances thereon. Ibid.
An assignment of a policy by the assured only covers such interest in the premises as he may have had at the time of the insurance, and at the time of the loss. If a loss takes place after the policy has been assigned, the assignee alone is entitled to recover. The rights of the assignee under the policy cannot be more extensive than the rights of the assignor. Cited the Columbia Insurance Company v. Lawrence, 10 Peters , 507 , 512 ; 2 Peters, 25, 49. Ibid.
Policies of insurance against fire are not deemed in their nature incidents to the property insured , but they are mere special agreements with the person insuring against such loss or damage as they may sustain ; and not the loss or damage that any other person having an interest as grantee, or mortgagee, or creditor, or otherwise, may sustain by reason of the subsequent destruction by fire. Ibid.
The public have an interest in maintaining the validity of the clauses in a policy of insurance against

and continued, and to remain in force, to the same period of time : Provided, That no new discounts shall be made by either of said banks,

except such as may be deemed proper to renew such notes as have

fire. They have a tendency to keep premiums down to the lowest rates, and to uphold institutions of this sort, so essential to the present state of the country for the protection of the vast interests embarked in manufactures, and on consignments of goods in warehouses. Ibid.
Questions on a policy of insurance are of general commercial law, and depend upon the construction of a contract of insurance, which is by no means local in its character, or regulated by any local policy or customs. Ibid.
The Circuit Court charged the jury, that at law, whatever might be the case in equity, mere parol notice of another insurance on the same property was not a compliance with the terms of the policy ; and that it was necessary in the case of such prior policy, that the same should not only be notified to the company, but should be mentioned in or endorsed on the policy ; otherwise the insurance was to be void and of no effect. Held, that this instruction of the Circuit Court was correct. It never can be pro-
perly said that the stipulation in the policy is complied with, when there has been no such mention or endorsement as it positively requires ; without which it declares that the policy shall be void and of no effect. Ibid.

Duties relating
tuondpeurblsiucpelravnid-s sion of the commissioner.

(a) Decisions of the courts ofthe United States upon land titles from the United States, and titles to the public lands :
Under the act of Congress of March 3, 1803, entitled " An act regulating the grants of land, and providing for the sale of the lands of the United States, south of the State of Tennessee ," such lands only were authorized to be sold as had not been appropriated by the previous sections of the law, and certificates granted by the commissioners in pursuance thereof. A right , therefore, to a particular tract of land, derived from a donation certificate given under that law, is superior to the title of any one who purchased the same land at the public sales , unless there is some fatal infirmity in the certificate, which renders it void. Ross v. Barland et al. 1 Peters, 666.
An act of Congress requires no precise form for the donation certificate. It is sufficient if the proofs be exhibited to the court of commissioners, to satisfy them of the facts entitling the party to the certificate. It is sufficient if the consideration, to wit, the occupancy, and the quantity granted, appears. Nothing more is necessary to certify to the government the party's right, or to enable him, after it is surveyed by the proper officer, to obtain a patent. Ibid.

108

TWENTY-FOURTH CONGRESS . SESS . I. CH. 352. 1836.

of the public lands of the United States, or in anywise respecting such
public lands, and, also, such as relate to private claims of land, and the
issuing of patents for all grants of land under the authority of the
Government of the United States, shall be subject to the supervision
and control of the Commissioner of the General Land Office, under the
direction of the President of the United States.
The second section of the act of Congress of March 3 , 1803 , was intended to confer a bounty on a numerous class of individuals, and in construing the ambiguous words of the section, it is the duty ofthe court to adopt that construction which will best effect the liberal intentions ofthe Legislature. Ibid. 667.
The time when the territory over which this law operated was evacuated by the Spanish troops, was very important, as the law was intended to provide for those who were actually at that time inhabitants
of, and cultivated the soil within it ; but whether it was in 1797 or 1798, was comparatively unimportant. The decision of the commissioners upon the period when the evacuation took place, is sufficient : and the court are disposed to adopt the construction of the act given by the commissioners west of Pearl river ;
that the evacuation took place on the 30th March 1798, by which persons coming within the objects of the section were entitled to donation certificates. Ibid. 667.
Congress have treated as erroneous the construction given to the law by the commissioners to settle claims to lands east of Pearl river, who have decided that only those who were settled on the lands within the territory in the year 1797 were entitled to donation certificates, and who had granted to others pre-emption certificates. Ibid. 668.
The commissioners appointed under the act of Congress relative to claims to lands of the United States south ofthe State of Tennessee, were authorized to hear evidence as to the time ofthe actual evacuation
of the territory by the Spanish troops, and to decide upon the fact. The law gave them power to hear and decide all matters respecting such claims, and to determine thereon , according to justice and equity ; and declared their deliberations shall be final. The court are bound to presume that every fact necessary to warrant the certificate, in the terms of it, was proved before the commissioners ; and that, consequently, it was shown to them that the final evacuation of the territory by the Spanish troops took place on the 30th of March 1798. Ibid.
By the treaty of St. Ildefonso, made on the 1st of October 1800, Spain ceded Louisiana to France ; and France, by the treaty of Paris , signed the 30th of April 1803 , ceded it to the United States. Under this treaty, the United States claimed the countries between the Iberville and the Perdido. Spain contended that her cession to France comprehended only that territory which at the time of the cession was denominated Louisiana, consisting of the island of New Orleans, and the country which had been originally ceded to her by France, west of the Mississippi . The land claimed by the plaintiffs in error, under a grant from the crown of Spain, made after the treaty of St. Ildefonso, lies within the disputed territory ; and this case presents the question , to whom did the country between the Iberville and Perdido belong after the treaty of St. Ildefonso ? Had France and Spain agreed upon the boundaries of the retroceded territory before Louisiana was acquired by the United States, that agreement would undoubtedly have ascertained its limits. But the declarations of France, made after parting with the province , cannot be admitted as conclusive. In questions ofthis character, political considerations have too much influence over the conduct of nations, to permit their declarations to decide the course of an independent government, in a matter vitally interesting to itself. Foster et al. v. Neilson , 2 Peters, 306 .
If a Spanish grantee had obtained possession of the land in dispute so as to be the defendant, would a court of the United States maintain his title under a Spanish grant , made subsequent to the acquisition of Louisiana, singly on the principle that the Spanish construction of the treaty of St. Ildefonso was right, and the American construction wrong ? Such a decision would subvert those principles which govern the relations between the legislative and judicial departments, and mark the limits of each. Ibid. 309.
The sound construction of the eighth article of the treaty between the United States and Spain, ofthe
22d of February 1829 , will not enable the court to apply its provisions to the case of the plaintiff. Ibid. 314.
The article does not declare that all the grants made by his catholic majesty before the 24th of January, 1818 , shall be valid to the same extent as if the ceded territories had remained under his dominion. It does
not say that those grants are hereby confirmed . Had such been its language, it would have acted directly on the subject, and it would have repealed those acts of Congress which were repugnant to it ; but its language is, that those grants shall be ratified and confirmed to the persons in possession , & c. By whom shall they be ratified and confirmed ? This seems to be the language of contract ; and, if it is , the ratification and confirmation which are promised must be the act of the Legislature. Until such act shall be passed, the court is not at liberty to disregard the existing laws on the subject. Ibid.
A title to lands, under grants made by Indian tribes or nations, north-west of the river Ohio, to private individuals, in the years 1773 and 1775 , cannot be sustained in the courts of the United States. Lessee of Johnson et al. v. M'Intosh, 8 Wheat. 543 ; 5 Cond. Rep . 515 .
The title to lands depends entirely upon the law of the nation in which they lie. Ibid. Discovery constitutes the original foundation of title to lands on the American continent, as between the different European nations ; the title thus derived , was the exclusive right of acquiring the soil from the natives, and establishing settlements upon it ; the title was to be consummated by possession . Ibid. The rights of the original inhabitants were, to a considerable extent, impaired, but in no instance entirely disregarded. The Europeans respected the right of the natives as occupants, but asserted the ultimate dominion to be in themselves ; and claimed and exercised, as a consequence of this ultimate dominion, a power to grant the soil while yet in the possession of the natives. Ibid. By the treaty between Great Britain and the United States, which concluded our revolution , the powers of government and the right to soil which had previously been in Great Britain , passed definitively to these States. Ibid.
The United States, or the several States, have a clear title to all the lands within the boundary lines described in the treaty, subject only to the Indian right of occupancy ; and the exclusive power to extinguish that right was vested in that government which might constitutionally exercise it. Ibid.
It is a principle of universal law, that, if an uninhabited country be discovered by a number of indivi-

SEC. 2. And be it further enacted, That there shall be appointed in said office, by the President, by and with the advice and consent of
the Senate, two subordinate officers, one of whom shall be called Principal Clerk of the Public Lands, and the other Principal Clerk on Private Land Claims, who shall perform such duties as may be assigned to them by the Commissioner of the General Land Office ; and in case

duals, who acknowledge no connection with, and owe no allegiance to any government whatever, the country becomes the property of the discoverers in common, so far as they can use it. Ibid.
If the discovery be made and possession taken under the authority of an existing government, which is acknowledged by the emigrants, the discovery is made for the whole nation ; the country becomes a part of the nation ; and the vacant soil is to be disposed of by that organ of the government which has the constitutional power to dispose of the national domains. Ibid.
According to the theory of the British constitution , all vacant lands are vested in the crown as representing the nation ; and the exclusive power to grant them is admitted to reside in the crown as a branch of the royal prerogative. Ibid.
Congress, in order to guard against imposition , declared by the law of 1804 that all grants of land made by the Spanish authorities in the territory west of the Perdido, after the treaty of St. Ildefonso , should be null and void, excepting those to actual settlers, acquired before December 20, 1803. Garcia v. Lee, 12 Peters, 511 .
The controversy relative to the country lying between the Mississippi and the Perdido rivers, and the validity of the grants made by Spain in the disputed territory after the cession of Louisiana to the United States, were carefully examined in the case of Foster & Elam v. Neilson. The Supreme Court in that case decided that the question of boundary between the United States and Spain was a question for the political departments of the government : that the legislative and executive branches having decided the question, the courts of the United States are bound to regard the boundary determined by them as the true one ; that grants made by the Spanish authorities of lands , which, according to this boundary line, belonged to the United States , gave no title to the grantees in opposition to those claiming under the United States, unless the Spanish grants were protected by the subsequent arrangements made between the two governments ; and that no such arrangements were to be found in the treaty of 1819, by which Spain ceded the Floridas to the United States, according to the fair import of its words, and its true construction . Ibid.
In the case of Foster & Elam v. Neilson, the Supreme Court said that the Florida treaty of 1819 declares that all grants made before the 24th of January 1818 , by the Spanish authorities, " shall be ratified and confirmed to the persons in possession of the lands, to the same extent that the same grants would be valid, if the territories had remained under the dominion of his catholic majesty :" and in deciding the case of Foster & Elam, the court held, that even if this stipulation applied to lands in the territory in question, yet the words used did not import a present confirmation by virtue of the treaty itself, but that they were words of contract : " that the ratification and confirmation which were promised must be the
act of the Legislature ; and until such shall be passed, the court is not entitled to disregard the existing laws on the subject." Afterwards, in the case of the United States v. Percheman, 7 Peters, 86, in reviewing the words of the eighth article of the treaty, the court, for the reasons there assigned, came to a different conclusion , and held that the words were words of present confirmation , by the treaty, where the land had been rightfully granted before the cession , and that it did not need the aid of an act of Con-
gress to ratify and confirm the grant. This language was, however, applied by the court, and was intended to apply, to grants made in a territory which belonged to Spain at the time of the grant. The case then before the court was one of that description . It was in relation to a grant of land in Florida,
which unquestionably belonged to Spain at the time the grant was made, and where the Spanish authorities had an undoubted right to grant, until the treaty of cession in 1819. It is of such grants that the court speak, when they declare them to be confirmed and protected by the true construction of the treaty, and that they do not need the aid of an act of Congress to ratify and confirm the title of the purchaser. The court do not apply this principle to grants made within the territory of Louisiana. The case of Foster & Elam v. Neilson must, in all other respects, be considered as affirmed by the case of Percheman ; as it underwent a careful examination in that case, and as none of its principles were questioned except that referred to. Ibid.
The power over the public lands is vested in Congress by the constitution without limitation , and has been considered as the foundation on which the territorial government rests. The United States v. Gratiot et al. , 14 Peters , 529.
The words " dispose of" the public lands, used in the constitution of the United States, cannot, under the decisions of the Supreme Court, receive any other construction than that Congress has the power in its discretion to authorize the keeping of the lead-mines on the public lands in the territories ofthe United
States. There can be no apprehensions of encroaching on State rights by the creation of a numerous tenantry within the borders of a State, from such reasons. Ibid.
The authority as given to the President of the United States to lease the lead-mines, is limited to a term not exceeding five years. This limitation, however, is not to be construed to be a prohibition to renew the leases from time to time, if he thinks proper so to do. The authority is limited to a short
period , so as not to interfere with the power of Congress to make other dispositions of the mines , should they think the same necessary. Ibid.
The law of 1807, authorizing the leasing of the lead-mines, was passed before Illinois was organized as a State. She cannot now complain of any disposition or regulation of the lead - mines previously made by Congress. She, secondly, cannot claim a right to the public lands within her limits. Ibid.
Under the acts of 1805 , chap. 26, 1806 , chap. 39, 1807, chap. 36, it was necessary to file the evidence ofan incomplete claim under French or Spanish authority, which bore date anterior to the 1st of October 1800 , as well as those which were dated subsequent to that day ; and in cases of neglect, the bar provided in the act applied to both classes. Ibid.
A title resting on a permit to settle and warrant of survey, dated before the 1st of October 1800, without settlement or survey of any kind having been made, was an incomplete title within that act. Ibid.

In making an entry of land , where mistakes occur which are occasioned by the impracticability of ascertaining the relative positions of the objects called for, the court will correct those mistakes, so as to carry out the intentions of the locator. Croghan's lessee v. Nelson , 3 Howard, 187.
There is no principle of the common law which forbids individuals from associating together to purchase lands from the United States, on joint account, at public sale . Oiner v. Pratt, 3 Howard, 333.
Where the purchaser of land from the United States has paid for it, and received a final certificate , it is taxable property, according to the statute of Michigan , although a patent has not been issued . Carroll v. Strafford, 3 Howard, 441.
Taxation upon lands so held is not a violation of the ordinance of 1787, as " an interference with the primary disposition of the soil by Congress ; " nor is it a tax on the lands ofthe United States. The State of Michigan could rightfully impose the tax. Ibid.
It was competent to the State to assess and tax lands at their full value , as the absolute property of the holder of the final certificate ; and , in default of payment, to sell them as if he owned them in fee. Ibid.
The act of 26th May 1830 , chap. 106 , providing for the final settlement of land claims in Florida, must be construed to contain the same limitation of time, within which claims are to be presented , as that provided by the act of May 23, 1828, chap. 70. The United States v. Marvin, 3 Howard , 620.
Under the act of Congress providing for the subdivision of the public lands, and the instructions of the Secretary of the Treasury, made under the act of 24th April 1820, chap. 49, entitled , An act making further provision for the sale of the public lands, it is the duty of the Surveyor General to leave out a fractional section in such a manner as that an entire quarter section may be had, if the fraction will admit of it. Brown's Lessee v. Clements, 3 Howard, 650.
The Surveyor General has no right to divide a fractional section by arbitrary lines, so as to prevent an entire quarter section from being taken up. Ibid.
The treaty by which Louisiana was ceded to the United States, recognised complete grants, issued anterior to the cession ; and the decision of a State court against the validity of a grant set up under such a title, would be subject to reversal by the Supreme Court, under the 25th section of the Judiciary Act. M'Donogh v. Mullander, 3 Howard, 693.
But if the State court only applies the laws of the State to the construction of the grant, it is not a decision against the validity of the grant, and the Supreme Court has no jurisdiction. Ibid.
Congress, in asking a complete grant, recognised them as they stood ; and the act of May 11 , 1820, chap. 87 , confirming such as were recommended for confirmation by the register and receiver, had no reference to any particular surveys. A decision of a State court, therefore, which may be in opposition
to one of these surveys, is not against the validity of a title existing under an act of Congress ; and the Supreme Court has no jurisdiction. Ibid.
By the treaty of 1795 between the United States and Spain, by which Spain admitted that she had no title to land north of the 31st degree of north latitude, her previous grants of land so situated were of course void. The country thus belonging to Georgia was ceded to the United States in 1802 , with a reservation that all persons who were actual settlers on the 27th October 1795 , should have their grants confirmed. Congress provided a board of commissioners to examine these grants, and declared that their decision should be final. The Court of Chancery of Mississippi had no right to establish one
of these grants which had not been brought within the provisions of the act of Congress. The claim itself being utterly void, and no power having been conferred by Congress on that court to take or exercise jurisdiction over it, for the purpose of imparting to it legality, the exercise of jurisdiction was a mere usurpation of judicial power, and the whole proceeding of the court void. Lessor v. Hickey & Stewart, 3 Howard , 750.
The Supreme Court has repeatedly declared , and in cases too where the instrument contained clear words ofgrant, that if the description was vague and indefinite, and there was no official survey to give
a certain location , it could give no right of private property in any particular parcel of land, which could be maintained in a court of justice. The United States v. King et al. 3 Howard, 733.
An equitable title is no defence in a suit at law brought by the United States. An imperfect title, derived from Spain before the cession, cannot be supported against a party claiming under a grant from the United States. Ibid.
The act of Congress of 29th April 1816, chap. 159, confirming the grant to a league square, restricted it to that quantity, and cannot be construed as confirming the residue. Ibid.
The act of Congress, entitled " An act to create additional land districts in the States of Illinois and Missouri, and the territories north of the State of Illinois," approved June 26, 1834 , chap. 76 , does not
require the President of the United States to cause to be offered for sale the public lands containing lead-mines, situated in the land districts created by the said act. United States v. Gear, 3 Howard , 120.
The lands containing lead-mines in the Indiana territory, or in that part of it made into a new land district by the act of 26th June 1834, chap. 76, are not subject , under any of the pre-emption laws which have been passed by Congress , to pre-emption by settlers upon the public lands. Ibid.
Digging lead- ore from the lead-mines upon the public lands of the United States, such a waste as entitles the United States to a writ of injunction to restrain it. Ibid.
The United States now hold the public lands in the new States by force of the deeds of cession, and the statutes connected with them, and not by any municipal sovereignty which it may be supposed they possess or have received by compact with the new States for that purpose . Pollock's Lessee v. Hager, 3 Howard, 212.
The shores of navigable rivers, and the soil under them, were not granted to the United States, but were reserved to the States respectively ; and the new States have the same rights, sovereignty and jurisdiction over this subject, as the original States. Ibid.

Commissioner shall deem it to be sufficiently useful and important, it shall be his duty to issue a patent therefor. But whenever, on such

examination, it shall appear to the Commissioner that the applicant was

not the original and first inventor or discoverer thereof, or that any part of that which is claimed as new had before been invented or discovered,

or patented, or described in any printed publication in this or any foreign country, as aforesaid, or that the description is defective and

insufficient, he shall notify the applicant thereof, giving him, briefly, such information and references as may be useful in judging of the propriety of renewing his application , or of altering his specification to

embrace only that part of the invention or discovery which is new. In every such case, if the applicant shall elect to withdraw his application, relinquishing his claim to the model , he shall be entitled to receive back

twenty dollars, part of the duty required by this act, on filing a notice in writing of such election in the Patent Office, a copy of which, certi-

fied by the Commissioner , shall be a sufficient warrant to the Treasurer

for paying back to the said applicant the said sum of twenty dollars. But

if the applicant in such case shall persist in his claim for a patent, with

or without any alteration of his specification , he shall be required to make oath or affirmation anew, in manner as aforesaid, And if the

specification and claim shall not have been so modified as, in the opinion of the Commissioner , shall entitle the applicant to a patent, he may, on appeal, and upon request in writing, have the decision of a board of

examiners, to be composed of three disinterested persons, who shall be appointed for that purpose by the Secretary of State, one of whom at

least, to be selected , if practicable and convenient, for his knowledge

and skill in the particular art, manufacture, or branch of science to which the alleged invention appertains ; who shall be under oath or

affirmation for the faithful and impartial performance of the duty imposed upon them by said appointment. Said board shall be furnished

with a certificate in writing, of the opinion and decision of the Com-

missioner, stating the particular grounds of his objection, and the part or parts of the invention which he considers as not entitled to be

patented. And the said board shall give reasonable notice to the applicant, as well as to the Commissioner, of the time and place of their

meeting, that they may have an opportunity of furnishing them with such facts and evidence as they may deem necessary to a just decision ; and it shall be the duty of the Commissioner to furnish to the board of

examiners such information as he may possess relative to the matter under their consideration . And on an examination and consideration

of the matter by such board, it shall be in their power, or of a majority of them, to reverse the decision of the Commissioner, either in whole

or in part, and their opinion being certified to the Commissioner, he shall be governed thereby in the further proceedings to be had on such application : Provided, however, That before a board shall be instituted

in any such case, the applicant shall pay to the credit of the Treasury,

But nothing in this act contained shall

be construed to deprive an original and true inventor of the right to a patent for his invention, by reason of his having previously taken out letters patent therefor in a foreign country, and the same having been

published, at any time within six months next preceding the filing of his specification and drawings. And whenever the applicant shall request it, the patent shall take date from the time of the filing of the

specification and drawings, not however exceeding six months prior to the actual issuing of the patent ; and on like request, and the payment of the duty herein required, by any applicant, his specification and drawings shall be filed in the secret archives of the office until he shall furnish the model and the patent be issued , not exceeding the term of one year, the applicant being entitled to notice of interfering applications.

shoal outside of the point, among the east breakers. The gale increased to a hurricane, and forced the vessel on her beam ends, and her masts and bowsprit were cut away. The master and crew deserted her to save their lives. After various fruitless efforts to save her, the libellants, all pilots of the outer harbor of Mobile, two days after she was stranded , and while yet in great peril, succeeded : and she was brought up to the city of Mobile by them, towed by their pilot boat, assisted by a steamboat employed by them. On a libel for salvage, the district court ofthe United States for the district of Alabama allowed, as salvage, one-third of 15,299 dollars and 58 cents, the appraised value of the brig and cargo. The owners of the brig and cargo appealed to the supreme court. By the Court- A pilot, while acting within the strict line of his duty , however he may entitle himself to extraordinary pilotage compensation for extraordinary services, as contradistinguished from ordinary pilotage for ordinary services, cannot be entitled to claim salvage. In this respect he is not distinguished from any other officer,
public or private, acting within the appropriate sphere of his duty. But a pilot, as such, is not disabled , in virtue of his office , from becoming a salvor. On the contrary, whenever he performs salvage services beyond the line of his appropriate duties, or under circumstances to which those duties do not justly attach, he stands in the same relation to the property as any other salvor : that is, with a title to compensation to the extent of the merit of his services, viewed in the light of a liberal public policy. Hobart v. Drogan, 10 Peters, 108.
Seamen , in the ordinary course of things, in the performance of their duties, are not allowed to become salvors, whatever may have been the perils, or hardships, or gallantry of their services, in saving the ship and cargo. Extraordinary events may occur, in which their connexion with the ship may be dissolved, de facto, or by operation of law ; or they may exceed their proper duty, in which cases they may be permitted to claim as salvors. Ibid.
It is not within the scope of the positive duties of a pilot to go to the rescue of a wrecked vessel, and employ himself in saving her, or her cargo, when she was wholly unnavigable. That is a duty entirely distinct in its nature, and no more belonging to a pilot than it would be to supply such a vessel with masts or sails, or to employ lighters to discharge her cargo in order to float her. It is properly a salvage service, involving duties and responsibilities, for which his employment may peculiarly fit him ; but yet in no sense included in the duty of navigating the ship . Ibid.
This was a case where the libellants acted as salvors, and not as pilots. They had, at the time, no particular relation to the distressed ship. They proffered useful services as volunteers, without any preexisting covenant that connected them with the duty of employing themselves for her preservation. The duties they undertook were far beyond any belonging to pilots ; and precisely those belonging to salvors. Ibid.
Suits for pilotage on the high seas, and on waters navigable from the sea, as far as the tide ebbs and flows, are within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States. The service is strictly maritime, and falls within the principles already established by the supreme court in the case of the Thomas Jefferson , 10 Wheaton's Rep. 428, and Peyroux v. Howard, 6 Peters' Rep. 682. Ibid.

and that the arrearage of said pension be vested in the Secretary of the

Treasury in trust for the use of the said Susan Decatur : Provided, That the said pension shall cease on the death or marriage of the said Susan Decatur.

Proviso.

APPROVED, March 3 , 1837.

(a) On the 3d of March, 1837, Congress passed an act giving to the widow of any officer who had died in the naval service of the United States, authority to receive, out of the navy pension fund , half the monthly pay to which the deceased officer would have been entitled under the acts regulating the pay in the navy, in force on the 1st day of January, 1835. On the same day, a resolution was adopted by Congress, giving to Mrs. Decatur, widow of Captain Stephen Decatur, a pension for five years , out of the navy pension fund, and in conformity with the act of 30th June, 1834, and the arrearages of the half-pay of a post captain, from the death of Commodore Decatur, to the 30th June, 1834 ; the arrear-
ages to be vested in trust for her by the Secretary of the Treasury. The pension and arrearages, under the act of 3d March, 1837 , were paid to Mrs. Decatur on her application to Mr. Dickerson, the Secretary of the Navy, under a protest by her, that by receiving the same she did not prejudice her claim under the resolution of the same date . She applied to the Secretary of the Navy for the pension and arrears, under the resolution, which were refused by him. Afterwards , she applied to Mr. Paulding, who succeeded Mr. Dickerson as Secretary of the Navy , for the pension and arrears, which were refused by him. The Circuit Court of the County of Washington, in the District of Columbia, refused to grant a mandamus to the Secretary of the Navy, commanding him to pay the arrears, and to allow the pension under the resolution of March 3d , 1837. Held, that the judgment of the Circuit Court was correct. Decatur v. Paulding, 14 Peters, 497.
In general, the official duties of the head of one of the executive departments, whether imposed by act of Congress or by resolution, are not mere ministerial duties. The head of an executive department of the government, in the administration of the various and important concerns of his office , is continually required to exercise judgment and discretion . He must exercise his judgment in expounding the laws and resolutions of Congress, under which he is from time to time required to act. If he doubts, he has a right to call on the Attorney General to assist him with his counsel ; and it would be difficult to imagine why a legal adviser was provided by law for the heads of departments, as well as for the President, unless their duties were regarded as executive , in which judgment and discretion were to be exercised. Ibid.
If a suit should come before the Supreme Court which involved the construction of any of the laws imposing duties on the heads of the executive departments, the Court certainly would not be bound to adopt the construction given by the head of a department. And if they supposed his decision to be wrong, they would , of course, so pronounce their judgment. But the judgment ofthe Court upon the
construction of a law, must be given in a case in which they have jurisdiction ; and in which it is their duty to interpret the act of Congress, in order to ascertain the rights of the parties in the cause before them. The Court could not entertain an appeal from the decision of one of the Secretaries, nor revise his judgment in any case where the law authorized him to exercise his discretion or judgment. Nor can it, by mandamus, act directly upon the officer , or guide and control his judgment or discretion in the matters committed to his care, in the ordinary discharge of his official duties. The interference of the Court with the performance of the ordinary duties of the executive departments of the government would be productive of nothing but mischief ; and this power was never intended to be given to them.

Preamble. Whereas in obedience to the Treasury circular of the sixth of Septem-

ber, eighteen hundred and twenty-seven, Doctor Henry Perrine, late

American Consul at Campeachy, has distinguished himself by his persevering exertions to introduce tropical plants into the United

States : and whereas he has demonstrated the existence of a tropical climate in southern Florida, and has shown the consequent certainty

of the immediate domestication of tropical plants in tropical Florida, and the great probability of their gradual acclimation throughout all our southern and southwestern States, especially of such pro-

fitable plants as propagate themselves on the poorest soils ; and whereas, if the enterprise should be successful, it will render valua-

ble our hitherto worthless soils, by covering them with a dense population of small cultivators and family manufacturers , and will thus promote the peace, prosperity, and permanency of the Union : Therefore,

Grant of land to H. Perrine.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the UniSec. Navy to

lands situated within the limits of the navy yard in Charlestown , in the Charlestown.

(a) See notes of the acts which have been passed relating to Virginia military land warrants, vol. 1 , 464 , vol. 3, 612.

(b) Certain streets were laid out by the town of Charlestown , Massachusetts ; and the proceedings

relative to the same were afterwards confirmed by an act of the Legislature. The streets passed over

the land of John Harris ; and he afterwards received a compensation from the town for taking the land

occupied by the streets. In 1800, the United States, under the authority of an act of the Legislature

of Massachusetts, purchased of Mr. Harris several parcels of land, now occupied as a navy yard. And

in 1801 , by an arrangement between the town of Charlestown and the United States, the streets, so far

as they were within the limits of the navy yard, were closed up, and have ever since been discontinued,

and have been used as a part of the navy yard. The agent of the United States and Mr. Harris, not

agreeing as to the value of the land taken for the navy yard, the value was ascertained and determined

by a jury proceeding under a law authorizing the same, and the amount of the valuation paid to Mr. Harris by the United States. The jury did not appraise the land on which the streets were laid out. One lot ofground was appraised " with the appurtenances." This action was instituted by the heirs of Mr. Harris claiming to be paid the value of the land on which the streets had been laid out, but which

had been discontinued . The defendant was the commandant of the navy yard.

By the Court. The term " appurtenances," in common parlance, and in legal acceptation, is used to

signify something appertaining to another thing as principal , and which passes as incident to the principal

In the case of Nelson , a petitioner in bankruptcy, in the Kentucky district, and Carland, an opposing
creditor, several points were adjourned by the district to the circuit court. Upon the hearing of the case in the circuit court, the district judge , as well as the justice of the Supreme Court, sat in the case ; and,

ruptcy, as follows : All persons whatsoever, residing in any State, District or Territory of the United States, owing debts, which shall not have been created in consequence of a defalcation as a public officer ; or as executor, administrator, guardian or trustee, or while acting in any other fiduciary capacity, who shall, by petition, setting forth to the best of his knowledge and belief, a list of his or their creditors, their respective places of residence , and the amount due to each, together

with an accurate inventory of his or their property, rights, and credits, of every name, kind , and description , and the location and situation of

each and every parcel and portion thereof, verified by oath, or , if con-

scientiously scrupulous of taking an oath, by solemn affirmation, apply

to the proper court, as hereinafter mentioned, for the benefit of this act, and therein declare themselves to be unable to meet their debts and
engagements, shall be deemed bankrupts within the purview of this act, and may be so declared accordingly by a decree of such court ; all persons, being merchants, or using the trade of merchandise, all retailers of merchandise, and all bankers, factors, brokers, underwriters , or marine insurers, owing debts to the amount of not less than two thousand

Merchants , bankers, & c.,
on petition of their creditors, may be declared

being opposed in opinion upon questions adjourned from the district court, they were certified to the Supreme Court on the motion of the counsel of the petitioner. Held, that the district judge cannot sit as a member of the circuit court, under the " Act to establish a uniform system of bankruptcy throughout the United States." Consequently, the points adjourned could not be brought before the Supreme Court on a certificate of division. Nelson v. Carland, 17 Peters' Rep., 181 ; S. C. , 1 Howard, 265.
An appeal or writ of error will not lie from the decision of the circuit court, in a case of bankruptcy, adjourned from the district court. The decision of the circuit court is conclusive on the district judge. Ibid.
Under the late bankrupt act of the United States, the existence of a fiduciary debt, contracted before
the passage ofthe act, constitutes no objection to the discharge of the debtor from other debts. Chapman v. Forsyth, 2 Howard, 202.
A factor, who receives the money of his principal, is not a fiduciary, within the meaning of the act. Ibid.
A bankrupt is bound to state, upon his schedule, the nature of a debt if it be a fiduciary one. Should
he omit to do so, he would be guilty of a fraud , and his discharge will not avail him ; but if a creditor, in such case, proves his debt and receives a dividend from the estate, he is estopped from afterwards saying that his debt was not within the law. Ibid.
But if the fiduciary creditor does not prove his debt, he may recover it afterwards from the discharged bankrupt, by showing that it was within the exceptions of the act. Ibid.
In Kentucky, the creditor obtains a lien upon the property of his debtor by the delivery of afi. fa. to the sheriff; and this lien is as absolute before the levy as it is afterwards. Savage's Assignee v. Best, 3 Howard, 807.
Therefore, a creditor is not deprived of this lien by an act of bankruptcy on the part of the debtor committed before the levy is made, but after the execution is in the hands of the sheriff. Ibid.
This court has no revising power over the decrees of the district court sitting in bankruptcy ; nor is it authorized to issue a writ of prohibition to it in any case, except where the district is proceeding as a court of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. Ex parte Christy, 3 Howard, 292.
The district court, when sitting in bankruptcy, has jurisdiction over liens and mortgages existing upon the property of a bankrupt, so as to inquire into their validity and extent, and grant the same relief which the state courts might or ought to grant. Ibid.
The control of the district court over proceedings in the state courts upon such liens, is exercised , not over the state courts themselves, but upon the parties, through an injunction or other appropriate proceeding in equity. Ibid.
The design of the bankrupt act was to secure a prompt and effectual administration of the estate of all bankrupts, worked out by the courts of the United States, without the assistance of state tribunals. Ibid.
The phrase in the 6th section, " any creditor or creditors who shall claim any debt or demand under the bankruptcy," does not mean only such creditors who come in and prove their debts, but all creditors who have a present subsisting claim upon the bankrupt's estate, whether they have a security or mortgage therefor, or not. Ibid.
Such creditors have a right to ask that the property mortgaged shall be sold, and the proceeds applied towards the payment of their debts ; and the assignee, on the other hand, may contest their claims. Ibid.
In the case of a contested claim , the district court has jurisdiction , if resort be had to a formal bill in equity or other plenary proceeding ; and also jurisdiction to proceed summarily. Ibid.
The principles established in the case of Ex parte the City Bank of New Orleans in the matter of Christy, assignee of Walden, reviewed and confirmed. Ibid.
But this court does not decide whether or not the jurisdiction of the district court over all the property of a bankrupt, mortgaged or otherwise, is exclusive, so as to take it away from the state courts in such
cases. Norton's Assignee v. Boyd, 3 Howard, 426. Where the defendant below became a bankrupt, the Supreme Court will not award a supersBeldaecask tvo.
stay an execution, because the assignee of the bankrupt has his remedy in the circuit court. Zacharie, 3 Howard, 453.

S. have if the United States shall have disposed of any tract of land, to which dtoiswphoisecdh oafnlyand any Indian was entitled, under the provisions of said fourteenth article Indian was en-

APPROVED, August 23, 1842.

(a) The decisions of the courts of the United States on the subject of interest have been : The decree on bottomry is to consider the sum loaned and the premium as a principal, and to allow common interest on that sum for the delay of payment after it is due. The Ship Packet, 3 Mason's C. C. R. 255.
An administrator is not liable to pay interest upon assets in his hands, unless under special circumstances. Neither is a partner, on partnership accounts before settlement, and a balance struck. Dexter v. Arnold, 3 Mason's  . C. R. 284.
Interest will not be allowed against a trustee holding a fund where he had made no interest, if there be no laches or neglect or use of the money on his part. Cassels v. Verner, 5 Mason's C. C. R. 332.
Interest on money in the hands of the administrator, is not chargeable where the same is retained in his hands until a suit shall determine the right of the claimant thereto. Wade v. The Administrators of Wade, 1 Wash. C. C. R. 477.
The court allowed the customary interest paid at Canton, on a note executed there. Cowqua v. Lauderbrun, 1 Wash. C. C. R. 521 .
The correct general rule is to calculate interest up to the period when a payment is made , to satisfy which the payment should be first applied ; and if it exceed the interest due, the balance is to be applied towards the payment of the principal ; but if the payment is not sufficient to discharge the interest , the principal is not to be increased by adding to it the balance of interest due at the time, so as to produce interest on interest. Smith v. The Administrators of Shaw, 2 Wash. C. C. R. 167.

STATUTE II. Aug. 23, 1842.
[ Obsolete . ]

Where the plaintiff has stated an account on a principle unfavorable to himself, as to the charge of interest, he ought to be bound by it. Ibid.
There is no difference as to the application of the general rule relative to calculating interest on debts
legally carrying interest, and on those debts where interest is given in the name of damages. Ibid. The rate of interest fixed by the law of Georgia, the contract having been made there, will be allowed
in the courts on such contracts, although it may exceed the interest allowed by the law of the State in which the court sits. Jaffray v. Dennis, 2 Wash. C. C. R. 253.
The defendant settled his account at the treasury department in 1808, on which a balance was stated against him. In 1812 he claimed further credits, which were allowed to him , and which reduced the balance claimed in 1808. The court instructed the jury to allow interest on the actual balance from 1808. United States v. Ormsby, 3 Wash. C. C. R. 195.
Where there have been running accounts between parties, and one party has been in the habit oftransmitting his accounts regularly to the other, striking a balance, and charging or giving credit for interest, as the balance might be, and no objections have been made to it, and where this mode of stating accounts is shown to be the custom of trade, such manner of charging interest is legal. Barclay v. Kennedy et al. 3 Wash. C. C. R. 350.
A usage to add interest to the annual account at the end of the year, and interest on the balance, does not apply in a case in which the commercial intercourse between the countries in which the parties respectively reside, had ceased when the account was transmitted ; nor will it authorize the creditor to make other rests in the account. Denniston et al. v. Imbrie, 3 Wash. C. C. R. 396.
Where an alien enemy has an agent in the United States, and this is known to the debtor, interest ought not to abate during a war. Ibid.
A promise was made by the defendant, the drawer of a protested bill of exchange, that if the plaintiff would give time, he would pay the bill when he should be able. In an action on the new promise, the plaintiff is entitled only to the sum stated in the bill, and to interest from the time when defendant was able ; and not to any damages. If the jury give more, the court will set aside the verdict, unless the plaintiff enter a remittitur for the overplus. Lonsdale v. Brown, 4 Wash. C. C. R. 148.
If there has not been a previous demand of the penalty of a bond, or an acknowledgment that the whole is due, interest is recoverable only from the commencement of the suit, on a bond with sureties given to the Bank of the United States for the faithful discharge of the duties of cashier of the branch bank at Middletown, Connecticut. United States Bank v. Magill et al., Paine's C. C. R. 661 .
Interest is not allowed on unliquidated damages. Gilpins v. Consequa, Peters' C. C. R. 86. It is generally in the discretion of the jury to give interest in the name of damages. Willings et al. v. Consequa, Peters' C. C. R. 172. Damages for breach of contract do not bear interest. Youqua v. Nixon , Peters' C. C. R. 224. When an attachment is laid on money in the hands of a third person , interest ceases from the time of the attachment until it is dissolved ; but where a debtor who is also a creditor lays an attachment in his own hands, interest is chargeable during the continuance of the attachment. Ibid. 303. It is the usage at Canton to add interest to the other charges on the amount of the articles sold, and for which compensation is demanded. This will be allowed in the United States, on a Canton contract. Ibid.
Interest on debts due by the citizens of the United States to the subjects of the king of Great Britain,
ceased during the revolutionary war, and during the war of 1812 ; but the mere circumstance of war existing between two countries is not a sufficient reason for abating interest on the debts due by the subjects of one belligerent to the subjects of another. Conn et al. v. Penn et al. Peters' C. C. R. 497.
A prohibition of all intercourse with an enemy during a war, furnishes a just reason for the abatement of interest on debts due to the subjects of the belligerent, until the return of peace. Ibid.
The rule as to the abatement of interest during the war, does not apply where the creditor, although a subject of the enemy, remains in the country of the debtor, or has a known agent residing there, and who is authorized to receive the debt. Ibid.
An account current, received and not objected to in a reasonable time , becomes a settled account bearing interest from the time it is stated, and the balance is payable on demand. Bainbridge & Co. v. Wilcocks, Baldwin's C. C. R. 538.
An account made up of principal and interest becomes one principal debt ; the aggregate balance, where the account is thus settled , bearing interest. Ibid. 540.
Compound interest is not illegal, and may be recovered on an express promise, or one implied by law, as a part of the contract. Ibid. 541 .
If an account contains a charge of interest during a war, it is recoverable if there is a promise to pay the amount after peace, or the account is in fact or law a settled account, from which a promise results by operation of law. Ibid. 542.
Whether the jury , in a case in which a man covenants to convey lands without fraud, and it afterwards appeared that, in truth, he had no title to the land, when he covenanted to convey, should allow interest on the value of the lands at the date of the contract , must depend on the circumstances of the case, of which they are the proper judges ; and it is competent to the defendant to give in evidence any circumstances tending to show interest should not be allowed. Letcher & Arnold v. Woodson, 1 Brockenb. C. C. R. 212.
The interest allowed on the personal estate, for the sums advanced by it to discharge the specialty debts, should, in accordance both with the general course of the court, and with justice in particular cases, be limited to twenty years. Byrd v. Executors of Byrd, 2 Brockenb. C. C. R. 171 .

the interest of the debt due, it seems that he should pay interest on the surplus rents and profits. Gordon v. Lewis, 2 Sumner's C. C. R. 143.
In the ordinary cases , where the relation of mortgagor and mortgagee is uncontroverted, if a mortgagee receive the rents of a mortgaged estate after his debt has been satisfied , and retain them to his own use, without paying them over to the mortgagor, he is chargeable with interest. Ibid.
If, however, there are sufficient equitable circumstances in favor of the mortgagee ; as if he retained the rents under a mistake, supposing the rights of the mortgagor extinguished ; he would not be liable for interest until after notice of the adverse claim . Ibid.
Interest on the amount ofthe debt as ascertained by the decree of the circuit court, was allowed from
the time of the judgment ; but the damages allowed by the court were not permitted to bear interest. Jennings et al. , Plaintiffs in Error, v . The Brig Perseverance , 3 Dall. 336 ; 1 Cond. Rep. 154.
Interest is to be calculated to the present time, upon the aggregate sum of principal and interest in the
judgment below ; but not to the next term of the circuit court, when the mandate will operate , as the party has a right to pay the money immediately. Brown v. Van Braam , 3 Dall. 344 ; 1 Cond. Rep . 157.
Interest is, in general, allowed from the time a demand is made for the wages of a mariner ; and if no
special demand is made, then from the commencement of the suit. Gammell v. Skinner, 2 Gallis. C. C. R. 45.
If captured property is ordered to be sold, then no interest is allowed. Rose v. Himely, 4 Cranch, 201 ; 2 Cond. Rep. 98.
Interest commences on a pecuniary legacy at the expiration of one year from the decease of the testator, whatever may be the posture of the estate, unless some other period is specified in the will. The cases of infant children , not otherwise provided for , and of adopted children under age, are exceptions to the general rule. Sullivan v. Winthrop, 1 Sumner's C. C. R. 1.
Where the executors invested certain sums, less than the whole amount of the legacy, in the name of the legatee ; held, that this was, pro tanto, a payment of the legacy ; and that the interest accruing on those sums, within the year from the time of such investment , belonged to the legatee. Ibid.
Where the vendor is indebted to the vendee, and the sale is made in order to pay the debt , the vendor must pay interest from the time the debt is liquidated until he makes a good title ; and the vendee is accountable for the rents and profits from the time the contract is perfected, until it is specifically performed. Hepburn et al. v. Dunlop & Co. , 1 Wheat. 179 ; 3 Cond. Rep. 529.
A party is as well entitled to interest on an appeal bond, as if he were to proceed on the judgment, if the judgment be on a contract for the payment of money. He is entitled to interest from the rendition of the original judgment. Sneed et al. v. Wister et al. 8 Wheat. 690 ; 5 Cond. Rep. 556.
The taking of interest in advance upon the discount of a note in the usual course of business by a banker, is not usury. This has long been settled, and is not now open for controversy. Thornton v. The Bank of Washington, 3 Peters , 40.
The taking of interest for sixty-four days on a note is not usury , ifthe note given for sixty days, according to the custom and usage in the banks at Washington, was not due and payable until the sixty-fourth day. In the case of Renner v. The Bank of Columbia , 9 Wheat. 581 , it was expressly held, that under that custom the note was not due and payable before the sixty -fourth day ; for until that time the maker could not be in default. Ibid. 40.
Where it was the practice of the party, who had a sixty day note discounted at the bank of Washington, to renew the note by the discount of another note on the sixty-third day, the maker not being in fact bound to pay the note according to the custom prevailing in the District of Columbia ; such a transaction on the part of the banker is not usurious, although on each note the discount for sixty - four days was deducted. Each note is considered as a distinct and substantive transaction . If no more than legal interest is taken upon the time the new note has to run, the actual application of the proceeds of the new note to the payment of the former note before it comes due , does not of itself make the transaction usurious. Something more must occur. There must be a contract between the bank and the party at
the time of such discount, that the party shall not have the use and benefit of the proceeds until the former note becomes due, or that the bank shall have the use and benefit of them in the mean time. Ibid.
The contract to accept the bills of exchange on which the action was brought, was made in Charleston, South Carolina. The bills were drawn in Georgia on B. and H. in Charleston, with a view to their payment in Charleston , where the contract was to be executed . The interest on the bill which was so drawn and was unpaid , is to be charged at the rate of interest in South Carolina. Boyce & Henry v. Edwards, 4 Peters, 111.
Interest is not chargeable on money collected by the marshal of the District of Columbia for fines due
to the levy court, the money having been actually expended by the marshal in repairs and improvements on the jail, under the opinions of the comptroller and auditor of the treasury department, that these expenditures were properly chargeable upon this fund, although those opinions may not be well founded. Levy Court of Washington v. Ringgold , 5 Peters , 451 .
In an action brought on a note given for payment for teas, the defence was, that teas of an inferior
quality were delivered ; the jury must not credit the defendant with the amount of damages, as of the day the teas were delivered , but as of the day when the verdict was rendered. The interest on the note is to be reckoned to the day of the verdict, and from that amount is to be deducted the amount of the
damages ascertained by the jury. Youqia v. Nixon et al. Peters ' C. C. R. 229. Assumpsit was brought for the proceeds of a cargo which was taken under legal process by the defend-
ants, the consignees, in a foreign port, for the debts of the prior owners of the ship. Held, that the plaintiffs, the consignors, by bringing assumpsit, had waived the tort so that the customary commissions should be allowed the defendants ; but that the defendants were chargeable with interest from the receipt by them of the proceeds of the cargo.
