DES NAVIRES DE GUERRE .

Rules adopted. Condition required.

Les règles suivantes devront être observées pour le déclassement des navires de guerre dont on doit disposer comme il est prescrit aux articles II et III.
I. Un navire pour étre déclassé doit être mis hors d'état de servir pour le combat.

Methods authorized. Sinking. Breaking up.
Conversion for target use.
Limitation.
Retention for training purposes, allowed.
By France.

II. Pour obtenir ce résultat d'une manière définitive,
on devra employer l'un des moyens suivants : (a) submersion du navire
sans possibilité de
renflouement ; (b) démolition. Cette opér-
tion devra toujours comprendre la destruction ou l'enlèvement de toutes machines , chaudières, cuirasses , ainsi que de tout le bordé de pont, de flanc et de
fond ; (c) transformation pour
l'usage exclusif de cible. Dans ce cas, on devra observer au préalable toutes les dispositions du paragraphe III de la présente partie, à l'exception du sous-paragraphe (6) , (dans la mesure nécessaire pour utiliser le navire comme
cible mobile) , et du sousparagraphe (7) . Aucune des Puissances Contractantes ne pourra
conserver, pour s'en servir comme de cible,
plus d'un navire de ligne à la fois.
(d) Parmi les navires de ligne arrivant à partir de 1931 à l'époque de leur déclassement, la France et l'Italie sont autorisées à conserver chacune deux bâtiments navigants, qui seront affectés exclusivement aux écoles de canonnage ou
de torpilles. Pour la France, ces deux navires

The following rules shall be observed for the scrapping of vessels of war which are to be disposed of in accordance with Articles II and III.
I. A vessel to be scrapped must be placed in such condition that it cannot be put to combatant use.
II. This result must be finally effected in any one of the following ways :
(a) Permanent sinking of the vessel ;
(b) Breaking the vessel up This shall always involve the destruction or removal of all machinery, boilers and armour, and all deck, side and bottom plating;
(c) Converting the vessel to target use exclusively. In such case all the provisions of paragraph III of this Part, except subparagraph (6) , in so far as may be necessary to enable the ship to be used as a mobile target, and except sub-paragraph (7) , must be previously complied with. Not more than one capital ship may be retained for this purpose at one time by any of the Contracting Powers.
(d) of the capital ships which would otherwise
. be scrapped under the present Treaty in or after the year 1931 , France and Italy may each retain two sea-going vessels for training purposes exclusively, that is, as gunnery or torpedo schools. The two vessels retained by France

For the purposes of the present
Treaty, the following expressions are to be understood in the sense defined in this Part.

NAVIRE DE LIGNE.

CAPITAL SHIP.

Capital ship.

Un navire de ligne, en ce qui
concerne les navires à construire dans l'avenir, est un navire de guerre autre qu'un navire porteaéronefs, dont le déplacement type est supérieur à 10.000 tonnes (10.160 tonnes métriques) , ou qui porte un canon d'un calibre supérieur à 8 pouces (203 millimètres) .

A capital ship, in the case of ships hereafter built, is defined as a vessel of war, not an aircraft carrier, whose displacement exceeds 10,000 tons ( 10,160 metric tons) standard displacement, or which carries a gun with a calibre exceeding 8 inches (203 millimetres) .

NAVIRE PORTE-AERONEFS.

AIRCRAFT CARRIER.

Air craft carrier. Ante, pp. 1659, 1660.

Un navire porte-aéronefs est un
navire de guerre d'un déplacement type supérieur à 10.000 tonnes (10.160 tonnes métriques) , spécifiquement et exclusivement destiné à porter des aéronefs. Il doit être construit de manière qu'un aéronef puisse y prendre son vol ou s'y poser. Son plan et sa construction ne doivent pas lui permettre de porter un armement plus puissant que celui autorisé soit par l'article IX, soit par l'article X, selon le cas.

An aircraft carrier is defined
as a vessel of war with a displacement in excess of 10,000 tons (10,160 metric tons) standard displacement designed for the specific and exclusive purpose of carrying aircraft. It must be so constructed that aircraft can be launched therefrom and landed thereon, and not designed and constructed for carrying a more powerful armament than that allowed to it under Article IX or Article X as the case may be.

Standard displacement.

DEPLACEMENT TYPE .
Le déplacement type d'un navire est le déplacement du navire achevé, avec son équipage complet, ses machines et chaudières,

établie, pour la partie fixe, sur la base de la dotation indiquée par l'article 6 du présent Règlement, et sur celle de la population ; la contribution normale de chaque État ne peut être inférieure à 5 pour 1000, ni supérieure à 15 pour 100 de la dotation totale, quel que soit le chiffre de la population.
Pour établir cette échelle , on détermine d'abord quels sont les Etats qui se trouvent dans les conditions voulues pour ce minimum et ce maximum, et l'on répartit le reste de la somme contributive entre les autres États, en raison directe du chiffre de leur population.
Les parts contributives ainsi calculées sont valables pour toute la période de temps comprise entre deux Conférences générales consécutives et ne peuvent être modifiées , dans l'intervalle , que dans les cas suivants :
a. Si l'un des États adhérents a
laissé passer trois années successives sans faire ses versements ;
b. Si, au contraire, un État, antérieurement retardataire de plus de trois ans, ayant versé ses contributions arriérées, il y a lieu de restituer aux autres Gou-
vernements les avances faites par eux .
La contribution complémentaire est calculée sur la même base de la population, et est égale à celle que les Etats anciennement entrés dans la Convention paient dans les mêmes conditions.
Si un État ayant adhéré à la Convention déclare en vouloir étendre le bénéfice à une ou
plusieurs de ses Colonies non autonomes, le chiffre de la population des dites Colonies sera
ajouté à celui de l'État pour le calcul de l'échelle des contributions.
Lorsqu'une Colonie reconnue autonome désirera adhérer à la Convention, elle sera considerée, en ce qui concerne son entrée dans cette Convention , suivant la décision de la Métropole, soit comme

for its fixed part on the basis of the appropriation referred to in Article 6 of the present regulations and of the population ; the normal contribution of each state cannot be less than 5 to a thousand nor more than 15% of the whole appropriation, regardless of the population.
In order to establish that scale, tiMone.thod of determinait shall first be found which are the states that are in the conditions required for the minimum and maximum and the remainder
of the quota shall be distributed among the other states in the direct ratio of their population .

The quota thus reckoned stands
for the whole time included between two consecutive General Conferences and can only be modified in the meanwhile in the following cases :

If after adhering to the con- ofEaxdtheenrsiinognSttoatceosl.onies vention a state declares it would like to extend the bene-

DEPARTMENT OF STATE, Washington, June 23, 1923.
EXCELLENCY : of In connection with the signing today of an agreement for the renewal of the
Convention of Arbitration concluded between the United States and Great
Britain, April 4, 1908, and renewed from time to time, I have the honor, in pursuance of our informal conversations, to state the following understanding which I shall be glad to have you confirm on behalf of your Government.
On February 24 last the President proposed to the Senate that it consent under certain stated conditions to the adhesion by the United States to the Protocol of December 16, 1920, under which the Permanent Court of International Justice had been created at The Hague. As the Senate does not convene in its regular session until December next, action upon this proposal will necessarily be delayed. In the event that the Senate gives its assent to the proposal, I understand that the British Government will not be averse to considering a modification of the Convention of Arbitration which we are renewing, or the making of a separate agreement, providing for the reference of disputes mentioned in the Convention to the Permanent Court of International Justice.
Accept, Excellency, the renewed assurance of my highest consideration . CHARLES E. HUGHES

If such regulations should permit the renewal of licenses, the
corresponding fee will not be greater than that charged for the original license.

mit the transfer of licenses, upon satisfactory proof that transferee or assignee is in every sense the true successor of the original licensee, and can furnish a certificate of identification similar to that furnished by the said original licensee, he will be allowed to operate as a commercial traveler pending the arrival of the new certificate of identification, but the cancellation of the bond for the samples shall not be effected before the arrival of the said certificate.

braced by his lines of business ;

that is to say, he may sell his

samples, thus incurring an obligation to pay the customs duties

thereupon, but he may not sell

other articles brought with him or sent to him, which are not

reasonably and clearly repre-

sentative of the kind of business

he purports to represent.

value. It is understood , however,

that this prescription shall be
subject to the customs laws of the respective countries.

Whereas by Article 22 of the

Considérant que, par l'Article 22 dudit Traité, il a été stipulé que certains territoires qui, à la suite de la guerre, ont cessé d'être sous la souveraineté des États qui les gouvernaient précédemment, seraient placés sous le mandat d'une autre Puissance et que les conditions du mandat seraient expressément définies dans chaque cas par le Conseil de la Société de Nations ;
Considérant que le bénéfice dudit Article 119 du Traité de

States and Germany, signed Au-
gust 25, 1921 , to restore friendly relations between the two nations ; and
Whereas four of the Principal
Allied and Associated Powers, to wit : the British Empire,
France, Italy and Japan, agreed that France should exercise the mandate for part of the former
German Colony of the Cameroons ; and
Whereas the terms of the said
mandate have been defined by
the Council of the League of Nations as follows :
ARTICLE 1.-The territory for which a mandate is conferred upon France comprises that part of the Cameroons which lies to the east of the line laid down in the Declaration signed on July 10th, 1919, of which copy is annexed hereto .
This line may, however, be slightly modified by mutual agreement between His Britannic Majesty's Government and the Government of the French Republic where an examination of the localities shows that it is undesirable, either in the interest of the inhabitants or by reason of any inaccuracies in the map Moisel 1/300,000, annexed to the Declaration, to adhere strictly to the line laid down therein.
The delimitation on the spot of this line shall be carried out in accordance with the provisions of the said Declaration.
The final report of the Mixed Commission shall give the exact description of the boundary line as traced on the spot ; maps signed by the Commissioners shall be annexed to the report. This report with its annexes shall be drawn up in triplicate; one of these shall be deposited in the archives of the League of Nations, one shall be kept by the Government of the Republic and one by His Britannic Majesty's Government.
ARTICLE 2.- The Mandatory shall be responsible for the peace, order and good government of the territory and for the promotion to the utmost of the material and moral well-being and the social progress of its inhabitants.
ARTICLE 3.- The Mandatory shall not establish in the territory any military or naval bases, nor erect any fortifications, nor organize any native military force except for local police purposes and for the defence of the territory .
It is understood , however, that the troops thus raised may, in the event of general war, be utilized to repel an

magne, le 25 août 1921 , pour rétablir les relations amicales entre les deux nations ;

Considérant que quatre des daAtgeroefeFmreanntcet. o manprincipales Puissances Alliées et

Associées, savoir l'Empire bri-

tannique, la France, l'Italie et le

Japon, ont convenu que la France exercerait le mandat sur une

partie de l'ancienne colonie allemande du Cameroun ;

Considérant que les conditions Terms of mandate. de ce mandat ont été définies

comme suit par le Conseil de la Société des Nations :

ARTICLE 1er.- Les territoires dont la France assume l'administration sous le régime du mandat comprennent la partie du Cameroun qui est située à l'est de la ligne fixée dans la Déclaration, signée le 10 juillet 1919 , dont une copie est ci-annexée.

Post, p. 1784.

Cette ligne pourra, toutefois , être légèrement modifiée par accord intervenant entre le Gouvernement de Sa Majesté britannique et le Gouvernement de la République française, sur les points où, soit dans l'intérêt des habitants, soit par suite de l'inexactitude de la carte Moisel au 1/300.000 annexée à la Déclaration, l'examen des lieux ferait reconnaître comme indésirable de s'en tenir exactement à la ligne indiquée.
La délimitation sur le terrain de ces frontières sera effectuée conformément

aux dispositions de ladite Déclaration .

Le rapport final de la Commission mixte donnera la description exacte de la frontière telle que celle-ci aura été déterminée sur le terrain; les cartes signées par les commissaires seront jointes au rapport. Ce document, avec ses annexes, sera établi en triple exemplaire ; l'un des originaux sera déposé dans les archives de la Société des Nations, le deuxième sera conservé par le Gouvernement de la République et le troisième par le Gouvernement de Sa Majesté britannique.
ARTICLE 2.-Le Mandataire sera
responsable de la paix, du bon ordre et de la bonne administration du territoire, accroîtra par tous les moyens en son pouvoir le bien-être matériel et moral et favorisera le progrès social des habitants .
ARTICLE 3.- Le Mandataire ne devra
établir sur le territoire aucune base militaire ou navale, ni édifier aucune fortification, ni organiser aucune force militaire indigène sauf pour assurer la police locale et la défense du territoire.

Toutefois, il est entendu que les troupes ainsi levées peuvent, en cas de guerre générale, être utilisées pour re-

attack or for defence of the territory outside that subject to the mandate.
ARTICLE 4.- The Mandatory:
1° Shall provide for the eventual emancipation of all slaves, and for as speedy an elimination of domestic and other slavery as social conditions will allow ;
2° Shall suppress all forms of slave trade;
3° Shall prohibit all forms of forced or compulsory labor, except for essential public works and services, and then only in return for adequate remuneration ;
4° Shall protect the natives from measures of fraud and force by the careful supervision of labor contracts and the recruiting of labor;
5° Shall exercise a strict control over
the traffic in arms and ammunition and the sale of spirituous liquors.
ARTICLE 5 .--In the framing of laws relating to the holding or transference of land, the Mandatory shall take into consideration native laws and customs, and shall respect the rights and safeguard the interests of the native population.
No native land may be transferred, except between natives, without the previous consent of the public authorities, and no real rights over native land in favor of non-natives may be created except with the same consent.
The Mandatory shall promulgate strict regulations against usury.
ARTICLE 6.- The Mandatory shall secure to all nationals of States Members of the League of Nations the same rights as are enjoyed in the territory by his own nationals in respect of entry into and residence in the territory, the protection afforded to their person and property, movable and immovable, and the exercise of their profession or trade, subject only to the requirements of public order, and on condition of compliance with the local law.
Further, the Mandatory shall ensure to all nationals of States Members of the League of Nations, on the same footing as his own nationals, freedom of transit and navigation, and complete economic, commercial and industrial equality; provided that the Mandatory shall be free to organize essential public works and services on such terms and conditions as he thinks just.
Concessions for the development of the natural resources of the territory shall be granted by the Mandatory without distinction on grounds of nationality between the nationals of all States Members of the League of Na-

pousser une agression ou pour la défense du territoire en dehors de la
région soumise au mandat. ARTICLE 4.- La Puissance manda-
taire devra :
1° Pourvoir à l'émancipation éventuelle de tous esclaves et, dans un délai aussi court que les conditions sociales le permettront, faire disparaître tout esclavage domestique ou autre ;
2º Supprimer toute forme de commerce d'esclaves ;
3º Interdire tout travail forcé ou
obligatoire, sauf pour les travaux et services publics essentiels et sous condition d'une équitable rémunération ;
4° Protéger les indigènes contre la fraude et la contrainte, par une surveillance attentive des contrats de travail et du recrutement des travail-
leurs ; 5° Exercer un contrôle sévère sur le

ARTICLE 5.- La Puissance manda-
taire devra, dans l'établissement des règles relatives à la tenure du sol et au transfert de la propriété foncière, prendre en consideration les lois et les coutumes indigènes, respecter les droits et sauvegarder les intérêts des indigènes.
Aucune propriété foncière indigène ne pourra faire l'objet d'un transfert, excepté entre indigènes, sans avoir reçu au préalable l'approbation de l'autorité publique. Aucun droit réel ne pourra être constitué sur un bien foncier indigène en faveur d'un non-indigène, si ce n'est avec la même approbation.
La Puissance mandataire édictera des règles sévères contre l'usure.
ARTICLE 6.- La Puissance mandataire assurera à tous les ressortissants
des États Membres de la Société des Nations les mêmes droits qu'à ses propres ressortissants, en ce qui concerne leur accès et leur établissement dans le territoire, la protection de leurs personnes et de leurs biens, l'acquisition des propriétés mobilières et immobilières, l'exercice de leur profession ou de leur industrie, sous réserve des nécessités d'ordre public et de l'observation de la législation locale.
La Puissance mandataire pratiquera, en outre, à l'égard de tous les ressortissants des États Membres de la Société des Nations et dans les mêmes conditions qu'à l'égard de ses propres ressortissants, la liberté du transit et de la navigation et une complète égalité économique, commerciale et industrielle, excepté pour les travaux et services publics essentiels, qu'elle reste libre d'organiser dans les termes et conditions qu'elle estime justes.
Les concessions pour le développement des resources naturelles du territoire seront accordées par le Mandataire sans distinction de nationalité entre les ressortissants des États Membres de la Société des Nations , mais de

TREATY-CAMEROONS MANDATE -FRANCE . FEBRUARY 13 , 1923. 1781

tions, but on such conditions as will maintain intact the authority of the local Government.
Concessions having the character of a general monopoly shall not be granted. This provision does not affect the right of the Mandatory to create monopolies of a purely fiscal character in the interest of the territory under mandate and in order to provide the territory with fiscal resources which seem best suited to the local requirements ; or, in certain cases, to carry out the development of natural resources, either directly by the State or by a controlled agency, provided that there shall result therefrom no monopoly of the natural resources for the benefit of the Mandatory or his nationals, directly or indirectly, nor any preferential advantage which shall be inconsistent with the economic, commercial and industrial equality hereinbefore guaranteed .
The rights conferred by this article extend equally to companies and associations organized in accordance with the law of any of the Members of the League of Nations, subject only to the requirements of public order, and on condition of compliance with the local law.
ARTICLE 7.- The Mandatory shall ensure in the territory complete freedom of conscience and the free exercise of all forms of worship which are consonant with public order and morality; missionaries who are nationals of States Members of the League of Nations shall be free to enter the territory and to travel and reside therein, to acquire and possess property, to erect religious buildings and to open schools throughout the territory ; it being understood, however, that the Mandatory shall have the right to exercise such control as may be necessary for the maintenance of public order and good government, and to take all measures required for such control.

manière à maintenir intacte l'autorité
du gouvernement local .
Il ne sera pas accordé de concession
ayant le caractère d'un monopole général. Cette clause ne fait pas obstacle au droit du Mandataire de créer des monopoles d'un caractère purement fiscal dans l'intérêt du territoire soumis au mandat et en vue de procurer au territoire les ressources fiscales paraissant le mieux s'adapter aux besoins locaux, ou, dans certains cas, de développer les ressources naturelles, soit directement par l'État, soit par un organisme soumis à son contrôle, sous cette réserve qu'il n'en résultera directement ou indirectement aucun monopole des ressources naturelles au bénéfice du Mandataire ou de ses ressortissants, ni aucun avantage préférentiel qui serait incompatible avec l'égalité économique, commerciale et industrielle ci-dessus garantie.
Les droits conférés par le présent article s'étendent également aux sociétés et associations organisées suivant les lois des États Membres de la Société des Nations, sous réserve seulement des nécessités d'ordre public et de l'observation de la législation locale.
ARTICLE 7.-La Puissance manda-
taire assurera, dans l'étendue du territoire, la pleine liberté de conscience et le libre exercice de tous les cultes, qui ne sont contraires ni à l'ordre public, ni aux bonnes moeurs ; elle donnera à tous les missionnaires ressortissants de tout État Membre de la Société des Nations la faculté de
pénétrer, de circuler et de résider dans le territoire, d'y acquérir et posséder des propriétés, d'y élever des bâtiments dans un but religieux et d'y ouvrir des écoles, étant entendu , toutefois, que le Mandataire aura le droit d'exercer tel contrôle qui pourra être nécessaire pour le maintien de l'ordre public et d'une bonne administration et de prendre à cet effet toutes mesures utiles.

Mandate-Contd .

ARTICLE 8.- The Mandatory shall apply to the territory any general international conventions applicable to his contiguous territory.
ARTICLE 9.- The Mandatory shall have full powers of administration and legislation in the area subject of the mandate. This area shall be administered in accordance with the laws of the Mandatory as an integral part of his territory and subject to the above provisions.
The Mandatory shall therefore be at liberty to apply his laws to the territory subject to the mandate with such modifications as may be required by local conditions, and to constitute the territory into a customs, fiscal or ad-

législation de la Puissance mandataire comme partie intégrante de son territoire et sous réserve des dispositons qui précèdent.
La Puissance mandataire est, en
conséquence, autorisée à appliquer aux régions soumises au mandat sa législation sous réserve des modifications exigées par les conditions locales et à constituer ces territoires en unions ou

ing the measures taken to apply the provisions of this mandate.
ARTICLE 11.-The consent of the
Council of the League of Nations is required for any modification of the terms of the present mandate.
ARTICLE 12.-The Mandatory agrees
that, if any dispute whatever should arise between the Mandatory and another Member of the League of Nations relating to the interpretation or the application of the provisions of the mandate, such dispute, if it cannot be settled by negotiation, shall be submitted to the Permanent Court of International Justice provided for by Article 14 of the Covenant of the League of Nations.

ARTICLE 1 .

ARTICLE PREMIER.

The frontier will start from the meeting-point of the three old British, French and German frontiers situated in Lake Chad in latitude 13° 05 N. and in approximately longitude 14° 05 E. of Greenwich.
Thence the frontier will be determined as follows :
1. A straight line to the mouth of the Ebeji ;
2. Thence the course of the river Ebeji, which upstream is named the Lewejil, Labejed , Ngalarem, Lebeit and Ngada, respectively, to the confluence of the rivers Kalia and Lebaiit ;
3. Thence the course of the river Kalia, or Ame, to its confluence with the river Dorma, or Kutelaha ;
4. Thence the course of the latter, which upstream is named the Amjumba, the village of Woma and its outskirts remaining to France ;
5. From the point where the river Amjumba loses itself in a swamp, the boundary will follow the median line of this swamp so as to rejoin the watercourse which appears to be the continuation of the Amjumba and which upstream is named Serahadja, Goluwa and Mudukwa respectively, the village of Uagisa remaining to Great Britain ;
6. Thence this watercourse to its confluence with the river Gatagule;

La frontière partira du point de rencontre des trois anciennes frontières britannique, française et allemande placé dans le lac Tchad par 13° 05' de latitude nord et approximativement 14° 05' de longitude est de Greenwich. De là, la frontière sera déterminée de la façon suivante:
1. Par une ligne droite jusqu'à l'embouchure de l'Ebeji ;
2. De cette embouchure, par le
cours de la rivière Ebeji, qui porte en amont les noms de Lewejil, Labejed, Ngalarem, Lebeit et Ngada, jusqu'au confluent des rivières Kalia
et Lebaiit ; 3. Du confluent des rivières Nga-
da, Kalia et Lebaiit, par les cours de la rivière Kalia ou Ame jusqu'à son confluent avec la rivière Dorma ou Kutelaha (Koutelaha) ; 4. Du confluent des rivières Kalia et Dorma ou Kutelaha, par le cours de cette dernière
rivière, qui porte en amont le nom d'Amjumba (Amyoumba) , le village de Woma (Voma) et ces dépendances devant rester à la France; 5. Du point, où s'interrompt la rivière Amjumba, à l'entrée du marécage, par une ligne traversant ce marais et rejoignant le cours d'eau qui paraît être la suite de la rivière
Amjumba et qui, en amont, porte les noms de Serahadja, Goluwa (Golouva) et Mudukwa (Moudoukva) , le village de Uagisa devant rester à la Grande-Bretagne;
6. Par le cours de cette dernière
rivière jusqu'à son confluent avec la rivière Gat-
tagule (Gatagoule) ;

gust 25, 1921 , to restore friendly relations between the two nations ; and
Whereas four of the Principal
Allied and Associated Powers, to wit: the British Empire,
France, Italy and Japan, agreed
that France should exercise the mandate for part of the former German Colony of Togoland ; and
Whereas the terms of the said
mandate have been defined by the Council of the League of Nations as follows :
ARTICLE 1. The territory over which a mandate is conferred upon France comprises that part of Togoland which lies to the east of the line laid down in the Declaration signed on July 10, 1919, of which a copy is annexed hereto .
This line may, however, be slightly modified by mutual agreement between His Britannic Majesty's Government and the Government of the French Republic where an examination of the localities shows that it is undesirable, either in the interests of the inhabitants or by reason of any inaccuracies in the map, Sprigade 1 : 200,000, annexed to the Declaration , to adhere strictly to the line laid down therein.
The delimitation on the spot of this line shall be carried out in accordance with the provisions of the said Declaration.
The final report of the Mixed Commission shall give the exact description of the boundary line as traced on the spot ; maps signed by the Commissioners shall be annexed to the report. This report with its annexes shall be drawn up in triplicate : one of these shall be deposited in the archives of the League of Nations, one shall be kept by the Government of the Republic and one by His Britannic Majesty's Govenment .
ARTICLE 2.-The Mandatory shall be responsible for the peace, order and good government of the territory and for the promotion to the utmost of the material and moral well-being and the social progress of its inhabitants .
ARTICLE 3.- The Mandatory shall not establish in the territory any military or naval bases, nor erect any fortifications, nor organize any native military force except for local police purposes and for the defence of the territory .
It is understood, however, that the troops thus raised may, in the event of general war, be utilized to repel an attack or for the defence of the territory outside that subject to the mandate.

le régime du mandat comprennent la pastie du Togo qui est située à l'est de la ligne fixée dans la Déclaration , signée le 10 juillet 1919, dont une copie est ci-annexée.
Cette ligne pourra toutefois être légèrement modifiée par accord intervenant entre le Gouvernement de Sa
Majesté britannique et le Gouvernement de la République française, sur les points où, soit dans l'intérêt des habitants, soit par suite de l'inexactitude de la carte Sprigade au 1 : 200,000, annexée à la Déclaration, l'examen des lieux ferait reconnaître comme indésirable de s'en tenir exactement à
la ligne indiquée. La délimitation sur le terrain de ces
frontières sera effectuée conformément aux dispositions de la dite Déclaration .
Le rapport final de la commission mixte donnera la description exacte de la frontière telle que celle-ci aura été déterminée sur le terrain ; les cartes signées par les commissaires seront jointes au rapport. Ce document, avec ses annexes, sera établi en triple exemplaire ; l'un des originaux sera déposé dans les archives de la Société des Nations, le deuxième sera conservé par le Gouvernement de la République et le troisième par le Gouvernement de Sa Majesté britannique.

1793

Concessions having the character of a general monopoly shall not be granted. This provision does not affect the right of the Mandatory to create monopolies of a purely fiscal character in the interest of the territory under mandate and in order to provide the territory with fiscal resources which seem best suited to the local requirements ; or, in certain cases, to carry out the development of natural
resources, either directly by the State or by a controlled agency, provided that there shall result therefrom no monopoly of the natural resources for the benefit of the Mandatory or his nationals, directly or indirectly, nor any preferential advantage which shall be
inconsistent with the economic, commercial and industrial equality hereinbefore guaranteed.
The rights conferred by this article extend equally to companies and associations organized in accordance with the law of any of the Members of the League of Nations, subject only to the requirements of public order, and on condition of compliance with the local law.
ARTICLE 7.- The Mandatory shall ensure in the territory complete freedom of conscience and the free exercise of all forms of worship which are consonant with public order and morality ; missionaries who are nationals of States Members of the League of Nations shall be free to enter the terri-

ARTICLE 9. The Mandatory shall have full powers of administration and legislation in the area subject to the mandate. This area shall be administered in accordance with the laws of the Mandatory as an integral part of his territory and subject to the above provisions.
The Mandatory snall therefore be at liberty to apply his laws to the territory subject to the mandate, with such modifications as may be required by local conditions, and to constitute the territory into a customs, fiscal, or administrative union or federation
with the adjacent territories under his sovereignty or control, provided always that the measures adopted to that end do not infringe the provisions of this mandate.

Il ne sera pas accordé de concession ayant le caractère d'un monopole général. Cette clause ne fait pas obstacle au droit du Mandataire de créer des monopoles d'un caractère purement fiscal dans l'intérêt du territoire soumis au mandat et en vue de procurer au territoire les ressources fiscales paraissant le mieux s'adapter aux besoins locaux, ou, dans certains cas, de développer des ressources naturelles, soit directement par l'État, soit par un organisme soumis à son contrôle, sous cette réserve qu'il n'en résultera directement ou indirectement aucun monopole des ressources naturelles au bénéfice de Mandataire ou de ses ressortissants, ni aucun avantage préférentiel qui serait incompatible avec l'égalité économique, commerciale et industrielle ci-dessus garantie.

ciétés et associations organisées suivant les lois des États Membres de la Société des Nations, sous réserve seulement des nécessités d'ordre public et de l'observation de la législation locale.

taire assurera, dans l'étendue du territoire, la pleine liberté de conscience et le libre exercice de tous les cultes, qui

la faculté de pénétrer, de circuler et de résider dans le territoire, d'y acquérir
et posséder des propriétés, d'y élever des bâtiments dans un but religieux et
d'y ouvrir des écoles, étant entendu, toutefois , que le Mandataire aura le droit d'exercer tel contrôle qui pourra
être nécessaire pour le maintien de l'ordre public et d'une bonne adminis-
tration et de prendre à cet effet toutes mesures utiles.
ARTICLE 8.-La Puissance mandataire étendra aux territoires le bénéfice des conventions internationales générales, applicables à ses territoires limitrophes.
ARTICLE 9.- La Puissance man-
dataire aura pleins pouvoirs d'administration et de législation sur les contrées faisant l'objet du mandat. Ces contrées seront administrées selon
la législation de la Puissance mandataire comme partie intégrante de son territoire et sous réserve des dispositions qui précèdent.
La Puissance mandataire est, en
conséquence, autorisée à appliquer aux régions soumises au mandat sa législation, sous réserve des modifications exigées par les conditions locales, et à constituer ces territoires en unions ou fédérations douanières, fiscales ou administratives avec les territoires avoisinants, relevant de sa propre souveraineté ou placés sous son contrôle, à

The Boundary Commissioners shall be authorized to make such minor modifications of the frontier line as may appear to them necessary in order to avoid separating villages from their agricultural lands . Such deviations shall be clearly marked on special maps and submitted for the approval of the two Governments. Pending such approval, the deviations shall be provisionally recognized and respected.
2º As regards the roads mentioned in Article 1 , only those which are shown upon the annexed map (1) shall be taken into consideration in the delimitation of the frontier.

l'abornement seront, d'autre part, autorisés à apporter au tracé de la frontière les modifications légères qui apparaîtraient nécessaires en vue
d'éviter de séparer les villages de leurs terrains de culture; ces déviations devront être indiquées clairement sur des cartes spéciales et soumises à l'approbation dex deux gouvernements intéressés.

britannique, aucun empêchement ne serait apporté à réalisation de ce désir, et il leur serait accordé le délai néces-

Whereas the terms of the said
mandate have been defined by the Council of the League ooff Nations as follows :

Considérant que les termes de ce mandat ont été définis comme suit par le Conseil de la Société des Nations :

ARTICLE 1.- The Mandatory shall frame, within a period of three years from the coming into force of this
mandate, an organic law for Syria and the Lebanon.
This organic law shall be framed in agreement with the native authorities and shall take into account the rights, interests, and wishes of all the population inhabiting the said territory. The Mandatory shall further enact measures to facilitate the progressive development of Syria and the Lebanon as independent States. Pending the coming into effect of the organic law, the government of Syria and the Lebanon shall be conducted in accordance with the spirit of this mandate.
The Mandatory shall , as far as circumstances permit, encourage local autonomy .
ARTICLE 2.- The Mandatory may maintain its troops in the said territory for its defence. It shall further
be empowered, until the entry into force of the organic law and the re-
establishment of public security, to organise such local militia as may be necessary for the defence of the territory, and to employ this militia for defence and also for the maintenance of order. These local forces may only be recruited from the inhabitants of the said territory .
The said militia shall thereafter be
under the local authorities , subject to
the authority and the control which the Mandatory shall retain over these forces. It shall not be used for purposes other than those above specified save with the consent of the Mandatory .
Nothing shall preclude Syria and the Lebanon from contributing to the cost of the maintenance of the forces of the Mandatory stationed in the territory .
The Mandatory shall at all times
possess the right to make use of the ports , railways and means of communication of Syria and the Lebanon for the passage of its troops and of all materials, supplies and fuel.
ARTICLE 3.- The Mandatory shall be entrusted with the exclusive control
of the foreign relations of Syria and the Lebanon and with the right to issue exequaturs to the consuls appointed by foreign Powers. Nationals of Syria and the Lebanon living outside the limits of the territory shall be under the diplomatic and consular protection of the Mandatory.
ARTICLE 4.- The Mandatory shall be responsible for seeing that no part of the territory of Syria and the Lebanon is ceded or leased or in any way placed under the control of a foreign Power.

ARTICLE PREMIER.-Le Mandataire
élaborera, dans un délai de trois ans à dater de l'entrée en application du présent mandat, un statut organique pour la Syrie et le Liban.
Ce statut organique sera préparé d'accord avec les autorités indigènes et tiendra compte des droits, intérêts et voeux de toutes les populations habitant lesdits territoires. Il édictera les mesures propres à faciliter le développement progressif de la Syrie et du Liban comme États indépendants. En attendant la mise en vigueur du statut organique, l'administration de la Syrie et du Líban sera conduite en accord avec l'esprit du présent mandat.
Le Mandataire favorisera les autono-
mies locales dans toute la mesure où les circonstances s'y prêteront.
ARTICLE 2.- Le Mandataire pourra
maintenir ses troupes dans lesdits territoires en vue de leur défense. Il pourra, jusqu'à la mise en vigueur du statut organique et du rétablissement de la sécurité publique, organiser les milices locales nécessaires à la défense de ces territoires et les employer à cette défense ainsi qu'au maintien de l'ordre. Ces forces locales ne seront recrutées que parmi les habitants desdits territoires.
Lesdites milices relèveront ensuite
des pouvoirs locaux sous réserve de l'autorité et du contrôle que le Mandataire devra conserver sur ces forces. Elles ne pourront être utilisées à d'autres fins que celles énoncées cidessus, à moins que le Mandataire ne l'autorise .
Rien n'empêchera la Syrie et le Liban de participer aux frais d'entretien des forces du Mandataire stationnées sur le territoire.
Le Mandataire disposera en tout temps du droit d'utiliser les ports, voies ferrées et moyens de communication de la Syrie et du Liban pour le passage de ses troupes et de tous matériel, approvisionnements et combustibles .

res de la Syrie et du Liban, ainsi que la déliverance des exequatur aux consuls des Puissances étrangères , seront du ressort exclusif du Mandataire.

ARTICLE 4.- Le Mandataire garan-
tit la Syrie et le Liban contre toute perte ou prise à bail de tout ou partie des territoires et contre l'établissement de tout contrôle d'une Puissance étrangère.

ARTICLE 5.- The privileges and immunities of foreigners, including the benefits of consular jurisdiction and protection as formerly enjoyed by Capitulation or usage in the Ottoman Empire, shall not be applicable in Syria and the Lebanon . Foreign consular tribunals shall, however, continue to perform their duties until the coming into force of the new legal organisation provided for in Article 6.
Unless the Powers whose nationals
enjoyed the afore-mentioned privileges and immunities on August 1st, 1914, shall have previously renounced the right to their re-establishment, or shall have agreed to their non-application during a specified period , these privileges and immunities shall at the expiration of the mandate be immediately re-established in their entirety or with such modifications as may have been agreed upon between the Powers concerned.

management (Conseils de fabrique) or in the management of religious communities and sacred shrines be-
longing to the various religions , the immunity of which has been expressly guaranteed .

ARTICLE 5.- Seront sans application en Syrie et au Liban les privilèges et immunités des étrangers, y compris la juridiction consulaire et la protection, tels qu'ils étaient autrefois pratiquées dans l'Empire ottoman, en vertu des Capitulations et des usages. Toutefois les tribunaux consulaires étrangers continueront à fonctionner jusqu'à la mise en application de la nouvelle organization judiciaire prévue à l'article 6.
A moins que les Puissances, dont les ressortissants jouissaient au 1er août 1914 desdits privilèges et immunités, n'aient préalablement renoncé au rétablissment de ces privilèges et immunités ou à leur application pendant une certaine période, ceux-ci seront à la fin du mandat et sans délai rétablis intégralement ou avec telle modification qui aurait été convenue par les Puissances intéressées .
ARTICLE 6.- Le Mandataire insti-
tuera en Syrie et au Liban un système judiciaire assurant, tant aux indigènes qu'aux étrangers, la garantie complète de leurs droits.

koufs en parfaite conformité avec les lois religieuses et la volonté des fondateurs.

ARTICLE 9.- Le Mandataire s'abstiendra de toute intervention dans l'administration des Conseils de fa-
brique ou dans la direction des communautés religieuses et sanctuaires des diverses religions, dont les immunités sont expressément garanties.

ARTICLE 10.-The supervision exercised by the Mandatory over the religious missions in Syria and the Lebanon shall be limited to the mainte-
nance of public order and good government; the activities of these religious missions shall in no way be restricted, nor shall their members be subjected to any restrictive measures on the ground of nationality , provided that their activities are confined to the domain of religion.
The religious missions may also concern themselves with education and relief, subject to the general right of regulation and control by the Mandatory or of the local government, in regard to education, public instruction and charitable relief.
ARTICLE 11.-The Mandatory shall see that there is no discrimination in Syria or the Lebanon against the nationals, including societies and associations, of any State Member of the League of Nations as compared with its own nationals, including societies and associations, or with the nationals of any other foreign State in matters concerning taxation or commerce, the exercise of professions or industries , or navigation, or in the treatment of ships or aircraft . Similarly, there shall be no discrimination in Syria or the Lebanon against goods originating in or destined for any of the said States ; there shall be freedom of transit, under equitable conditions, across the said territory .
Subject to the above, the Mandatory may impose or cause to be imposed by the local governments such taxes and customs duties as it may consider necessary .

The Mandatory may take or cause to be taken, subject to the provisions of paragraph 1 of this article, such steps as it may think best to ensure the development of the natural resources of the said territory and to safeguard the interests of the local population.
Concessions for the development of these natural resources shall be granted without distinction of nationality between the nationals of all States Members of the League of Nations, but on condition that they do not infringe upon the authority of the local Government. Concessions in the nature of a general monopoly shall not be granted. This clause shall in no way limit the right of the Mandatory to create monopolies of a purely fiscal character in the interest of the territory of Syria and the Lebanon, and with a view to assuring to the

ARTICLE 10.- Le contrôle exercé par le Mandataire sur les missions reli-
gieuses en Syrie et au Liban se bornera au maintien de l'ordre public et de la
bonne administration; aucune atteinte ne sera portée à la libre activité
desdites missions religieuses . Les membres de ces missions ne seront l'objet d'aucune mesure restrictive du fait de leur nationalité, pourvu que leur ac-
tivité ne sorte pas du domaine religieux .
Les missions religieuses pourront
également s'occuper d'oeuvres d'instruction et d'assistance publique sous
réserve du droit général de réglementation et de contrôle du Mandataire ou
des gouvernements locaux en matière d'éducation, d'instruction et d'assistance publique.
ARTICLE 11.-Il appartiendra au Mandataire de faire en sorte qu'aucune mesure ne soit prise de nature à mettre en Syrie et au Liban les ressortissants y compris les sociétés et les associations, d'un Etat Membre de la Société des Nations dans un état d'infériorité, soit
par rapport à ses propes ressortissants , y compris les sociétés et associations , soit par rapport à ceux de tout autre État étranger, aussi bien en matière fiscale et commerciale qu'au point de vue de l'exercice des industries et
professions, de la navigation et du traitement accordé aux navires et
aéronefs . De même, il ne sera imposé en Syrie et au Liban aucun traitement différentiel entre les marchandises
originaires ou à destination de l'un desdits Etats ; il y aura, dans des conditions équitables liberté de transit à travers lesdits territoires.
Sous réserve des stipulations cidessus, le Mandataire pourra établir ou faire établir par les gouvernements
locaux toutes taxes et droits de douane jugés necessaires . Le Mandataire , ou le gouvernement local agissant sur ses conseils, pourra égaglement conclure, pour des raisons de voisinage, des arrangements douaniers speciaux avec un pays limitrophe.
Le Mandataire pourra prendre ou
faire prendre, sous réserve des stipulations de l'alinéa premier du présent article, toutes les mesures propres à assurer le développement des ressources naturelles desdits territoires et
à sauvegarder les intérêts des populations locales .
Les concessions pour le dévelop-
pement desdites ressources naturelles seront accordées sans distinctíon du fait de la nationalité entre les ressor-
tissants de tous les États Membres de la Société des Nations, mais à des conditions qui conserveront intacte l'autorité du gouvernement local. Il ne sera pas accordé de concession ayant le caractère d'un monopole général. Cette clause ne fara pas obstacle au droit du Mandataire de créer des monopoles d'un caractère purement fiscal dans l'intérêt des territoires de la Syrie et du Liban et en vue de

territory the fiscal resources which would appear best adpated to the local needs , or, in certain cases, with a view to developing the natural resources either directly by the State or through an organisation under its control, provided that this does not involve either directly or indirectly the creation of a monopoly of the natural resources in favour of the Mandatory or its nationals , nor involve any preferential treatment which would be incompatible with the economic, commercial and industrial equality guaranteed above.

ARTICLE II.

ARTIKEL II.

(1) His Majesty agrees that he will raise no objection to the boarding of private vessels under the Swedish flag outside the limits of territorial waters by the authorities of the United States, its territories or possessions in order that enquiries may be addressed to those on board and an examination be made of the ship's papers for the purpose of ascertaining whether the vessel or those on board are endeavoring to import or have imported alcoholic beverages into the United States, its territories or possessions in violation of the laws there in force. When such enquiries and examination show a reasonable ground for suspicion, a search of the vessel may be initiated .
(2) If there is reasonable cause for belief that the vessel has committed or is committing or attempting to commit an offense against the laws of the United States, its territories or possessions prohibiting the importation of alcoholic beverages, the vessel may be seized and taken into a port of the United States, its territories or possessions for adjudication in accordance with such laws.
(3) The rights conferred by this article shall not be exercised at a greater distance from the coast of the United States its territories or possessions than can be traversed in one hour by the vessel suspected of endeavoring to commit the offense. In cases, however, in which the liquor is intended to be conveyed to the United States its territories or possessions by a vessel other than the one boarded and searched, it shall be the speed of such other vessel and not the speed of the vessel boarded, which shall determine the distance from the coast at which the right under this article can be exercised .

Boarding of private (1 ) Hans Majestät samtycker Swedish vessels out-

to import or have imported alcoholic beverages into the United States , its territories or possessions in violation of the laws there in force. When such enquiries and examination show a reason-
able ground for suspicion, a search of the vessel may be initiated .

(3) The rights conferred by this article shall not be exercised at a greater distance from the coast of the United States its territories or possessions than can be traversed in one hour by the vessel suspected of endeavoring to commit the offense. In cases,
however, in which the liquor is intended to be conveyed to the United States its territories or possessions by a vessel other than the one boarded and
searched, it shall be the speed of such other vessel and not the speed of the vessel boarded, which shall determine the dis-
tance from the coast at which the right under this article can be exercised .

tion. The Post Office making delivery shall fix the amount of such
fee in accordance with its regulations. pro-
8. Except in cases of loss or damage through force majeure (causes
beyond control ) as that term is defined by the legal decisions of the

country in the service of which the loss or damage occurs, when an

insured parcel has been lost or damaged or all or part of its contents

abstracted, the sender, or in default of or at the request of the sender,

the addressee, shall be entitled to an indemnity corresponding to the

actual amount, based on the actual value at the time of mailing, of the loss, abstraction, or damage, unless the damage has arisen from

the fault or negligence of the sender or the addressee or the repre-

sentative of either, or from the nature of the article, provided always

that the indemnity does not exceed the sum for which the parcel

was insured and for which the required insurance fee was paid.

Postage on lost parcels to be returned.

The sender of an insured parcel which has been lost, or of which

the contents have been lost or completely destroyed in the post, shall

also be entitled to the return of the postage. He is not, however,

entitled to the return of the insurance fee.

No compensation if alleged contents above In case the sender of an insured parcel, with intent to defraud,

shall at any time allege the contents to be above their real value, he

shall lose all claim to compensation or to the return of the postage, and the enforcement of this rule shall not prejudice any legal pro-

ceedings to which such fraudulent declaration may have rendered

him liable.

Office responsible for

indemnity.

The obligation of paying the indemnity shall rest with the country

to which the mailing office is subordinate. That country can make

a claim on the country responsible, that is to say, against the administration on the territory or in the service of which the loss, abstrac-

tion, or damage took place.

Until the contrary is proved, responsibility for an insured parcel

rests with the country which having received the parcel without

making any observation cannot establish correct delivery or other

proper disposition. Responsibility for loss damage or for abstraction discovered by the
receiving Office of Exchange at the time of opening the receptacles and duly notified to the despatching Office of Exchange by verification note shall fall upon the Administration to which the despatching Office of Exchange is subordinate unless it be proved that the loss damage or abstraction occurred during transit in the service of the receiving Administration.

If the loss, abstraction, or damage occurred in the course of con-

veyance, and it shall not be possible to ascertain on the territory or in

the service of which country the loss, abstraction, or damage took

place, the indemnity shall be shared equally.

No responsibility if receipted for without

In the event of the absence of such agent from the country or its seat of Government, or where extradition is sought from territory included in the preceding paragraphs , other than the United States or Bulgaria, requisitions may be made by superior consular officers. It shall be competent for such diplomatic or superior consular officers to ask and obtain a mandate or preliminary warrant of arrest for the person whose surrender is sought, whereupon the judges and magistrates of the two Governments shall respectively have power and authority, upon complaint made under oath, to issue a warrant for the apprehension of the person charged , in order that he or she may be brought before such judge or magistrate, that the evidence of criminality may be heard and considered and if, on such hearing, the evidence be deemed sufficient to sustain the charge, it shall be the duty of the examining judge or magistrate to certify it to the proper executive authority, that a warrant may issue for the surrender of the fugitive.
In case of urgency, the application for arrest and detention may be addressed directly to the competent magistrate in conformity to the statutes in force.

(7) The Commissioner, after examining the claims , will prepare a report showing precisely the claims which he is of opinion should be recognised at once and those which, either because they are disputed or for any other
reason, he is of opinion should be submitted to arbitration as hereinafter provided. Copies of this report will be forwarded by the Commissioner to the Governments concerned .
(8) If the amount of the sums deposited in accordance with clause (3) is insufficient to cover the expenses of the examination of the claims, the Commissioner will, in every case where he is of opinion that a claim should be recognised, at once state what further sum the claimant should
be required to pay. This sum will be based on the amount of the land to which the claimant's title is recognised .
If the sums deposited in accordance with clause (3) exceed the expenses of the examination, the balance will be devoted to the cost of the arbitration hereinafter provided for.
(9) Within three months from the date of the report referred to in clause (7) of this paragraph, the Norwegian Government shall take the necessary steps to confer upon claimants whose claims have been recognised by the Commissioner a valid title securing to them the exclusive property in the land in question, in accordance with the laws and regulations in force or to be enforced in the territories specified in Article 1 of the present Treaty, and subject to the mining regulations referred to in Article 8 of the present Treaty.
In the event, however, of a further payment being required in accordance with clause (8) of this paragraph, a provisional title only will be delivered, which title will become definitive on payment by the claimant, within such reasonable period as the Norwegian Government may fix, of thefurther sum required of him.

The nation has lost a wise and enlightened statesman and the American people a true friend and counsellor whose whole public life was inspired with the desire to promote the best interests of the United States and the welfare of all its citizens. His private life was
marked by gentleness and brotherly sympathy, and by the charm of his personality he made friends of all who came in contact with him.
It is meet that the deep grief which fills the hearts of the American
people should find fitting expression . Now, therefore, I , Calvin Coolidge, President of the United States ,10A, pp19o2i3n,titnhge dAuagyusotf

I earnestly recommend the people to assemble on that day in their respective places of divine worship , there to bow down in submission to the will of Almighty God , and to pay out of full hearts the homage of love and reverence to the memory of the great and good President, whose death has so sorely smitten the nation .

IN WITNESS WHEREOF I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed .

National Fire Pre-

vention Day.

WITH the approach of October 9th, anniversary of the great

Preamble.

Chicago fire, it is customary for the Chief Executive to direct atten-

tion each year to the enormous fire loss of the nation and to propose the observance of that date as National Fire Prevention Day. I am informed that the national fire loss for 1922 approximated fifteen thousand lives and somewhat more than five hundred million dollars.

If this is correct, or even approximately correct, it indicates that the 1922 fire waste was the largest since 1906 , when the fearful San

Francisco conflagration brought the total to above five hundred million dollars. The fact that, with all our improvement of methods

in most directions, the fire loss continues to mount upward year by

year places a striking point of interrogation opposite our claims of high national efficiency. I am informed that in 1912, which was not an exceptional year, the per capita fire loss of the country was $2.16, and that in 1922 it was $4.67. The importance of every possible

measure to reduce this loss is so apparent as to require no argument. The specialists in this subject agree that probably the greater part of the loss is due to human factors, such as carelessness and moral

hazards ; another large portion to poor construction, inefficient enforcement of building regulations, and the like. All of these are

subject to correction through proper procedures , and it is highly desirable that public attention be directed to them and every encour-

agement given to measures for lessening the fire menace. In view of these facts
Recommending ob- NOW, THEREFORE, I, Calvin Coolidge, President of the s1e9r23va, nce of October 9, United States, designate Tuesday, October 9th, as National Fire

Prevention Day, and recommend that it be observed in a manner most fitting. I particularly recommend the importance of educational effort through the schools, industrial establishments , and in the homes.

In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed .

A PROCLAMATION
National Education FROM its earliest beginnings , America has been devoted to the Week. cause of education. This country was founded on the ideal of Preamble. ministering to the individual. It was realized that this must be done by the institutions of religion and government. In order that there might be a properly educated clergy and well trained civil magistrates, one of the first thoughts of the early settlers was to provide for a college of liberal culture, while for the general diffusion of knowledge, primary schools were established . This course was taken as the necessary requirement of enlightened society. Such a policy, once adopted, has continued to grow in extent . With the adoption of the Federal Constitution and the establishment of free governments in the states of the Union, there was additional reason for broadening the opportunity for education . Our country adopted the principle of self-government by a free people. Those who were worthy of being free, were worthy of being educated .

1926

PROCLAMATIONS , 1923.

Those who had the duty and responsibility of government, must necessarily have the education with which to discharge the obligations of citizenship . The sovereign had to be educated. The

sovereign had become the people. Schools and universities were provided by the various governments, and founded and fostered by private charity, until their buildings dotted all the land .

The willingness of the people to bear the burdens of maintaining these institutions, and the patriotic devotion of an army of teachers , who, in many cases, might have earned larger incomes in other

pursuits, have made it possible to accomplish results with which we may well be gratified. But the task is not finished , it has only been begun.
We have observed the evidences of a broadening vision of the whole educational system. This has included a recognition that education must not end with the period of school attendance, but must be given every encouragement thereafter. To this end the night schools of

the cities, the moonlight schools of the southern Appalachian countries, the extension work of the colleges and universities, the provision for teaching technical, agricultural and mechanical arts, have marked out the path to a broader and more widely diffused national

culture. To insure the permanence and continuing improvement of such an educational policy, there must be the fullest public realization of its absolute necessity. Every American citizen is entitled to a liberal education. Without this, there is no guarantee for the

permanence of free institutions, no hope of perpetuating self-government. Despotism finds its chief support in ignorance. Knowledge and freedom go hand in hand.

In order that the people of the nation may think on these things, it is desirable that there should be an annual observance of Educational

Week.

Urging observance of

week beginning No- NOW , THEREFORE, I , Calvin Coolidge, President of the United

vember 18, as.

States, do hereby proclaim the week beginning on the eighteenth of

November, next, as National Education Week, and urge its obser-

vance throughout the country. I recommend that the state and

local authorities cooperate with the civic and religious bodies to

secure its most general and helpful observance, for the purpose of

more liberally supporting and more effectively improving the educational facilities of our country.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed .

A PROCLAMATION

Thanksgiving 1923.
Preamble.

Day, The American people, from their earliest days, have observed the
wise custom of acknowledging each year the bounty with which divine Providence has favored them. In the beginnings, this acknowledgment was a voluntary return of thanks by the community for the fruitfulness of the harvest. Though our mode of life has greatly changed, this custom has always survived . It has made Thanksgiving Day not only one of the oldest but one of the most characteristic observances of our country. On that day, in home and church, in family and in public gatherings, the whole nation has for generations paid the tribute due from grateful hearts for blessings bestowed .
To center our thought in this way upon the favor which we have been shown has been altogether wise and desirable. It has given opportunity justly to balance the good and the evil which we have experienced. In that we have never failed to find reasons for being grateful to God for a generous preponderance of the good. Even in the least propitious times, a broad contemplation of our whole position has never failed to disclose overwhelming reasons for thankfulness. Thus viewing our situation, we have found warrant for a more hopeful and confident attitude toward the future.
În this current year, we now approach the time which has been accepted by custom as most fitting for the calm survey of our estate and the return of thanks. We shall the more keenly realize our good fortune, if we will, in deep sincerity, give to it due thought, and more especially, if we will compare it with that of any other community in the world.
The year has brought to our people two tragic experiences which
have deeply affected them. One was the death of our beloved President Harding, which has been mourned wherever there is a realization of the worth of high ideals, noble purpose and unselfish service carried even to the end of supreme sacrifice. His loss recalled the nation to a less captious and more charitable attitude . It sobered the whole thought of the country. A little later came the unparalleled disaster

PROCLAMATIONS , 1923.

1931

to the friendly people of Japan. This called forth from the people of the United States a demonstration of deep and humane feeling. It

was wrought into the substance of good works. It created new evidences of our international friendship, which is a guarantee of world

peace. It replenished the charitable impulse of the country. By experiences, such as these, men and nations are tested and
refined . We have been blessed with much of material prosperity. We shall be better able to appreciate it if we remember the privations others have suffered , and we shall be the more worthy of it if we use

it for their relief. We will do well then to render thanks for the good that has come to us, and show by our actions that we have become stronger, wiser , and truer by the chastenings which have been imposed upon us. We will thus prepare ourselves for the part we must take in a world which forever needs the full measure of service . We have been a most favored people. We ought to be a most generous

people. We have been a most blessed people. We ought to be a
most thankful people. WHEREFORE, I, Calvin Coolidge, President of the United beTrh2u9r, s19d2a3y,,desNiognvaetme-d

States, do hereby fix and designate Thursday, the twenty-ninth day as Thanksgiving Day. of November, as Thanksgiving Day, and recommend its general observance throughout the land. It is urged that the people, gathering in their homes and their usual places of worship, give expression to their gratitude for the benefits and blessings that a gracious Providence has bestowed upon them, and seek the guidance of Almighty God, that they may deserve a continuance of His favor.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand and caused to be affixed the great seal of the United States.

The death of Woodrow Wilson , President of the United States

from March 4, 1913, to March 4, 1921 , which occurred at 11:15

His early profession as a lawyer was abandoned to enter academic life . In this chosen field he attained the highest rank as an educator, and has left his impress upon the intellectual thought of the country. From the Presidency of Princeton University he was called by his fellow citizens to be the Chief Executive of the State of New Jersey. The duties of this high office he so conducted as to win the confidence of the people of the United States, who twice elected him to the Chief Magistracy of the Republic . As President of the United States he was moved by an earnest desire to promote the best interests of the country as he conceived them. His acts were prompted by high motives and his sincerity of purpose can not be questioned. He led the nation through the terrific struggle of the world war with a lofty idealism which never failed him. He gave utterance to the aspiration of humanity with an eloquence which held the attention of all the earth and made America a new and enlarged influence in the destiny of mankind .
In testimony of the respect in which his memory is held by the taSruyi,taanbdlenacvivaill,homniolrisGovernment and people of the United States , I do hereby direct directed. that the flags of the White House and of the several Departmental buildings be displayed at half staff for a period of thirty days, and that suitable military and naval honors under orders of the Secretary of War and of the Secretary of the Navy may be rendered on the day of the funeral.

1. (a) Persons born in the portions of Persia, Russia, or the Arabian peninsula situated within the Barred Zone, and who are admissible under the immigration laws of the United States as quota immigrants, will be charged to the quotas of these countries ; and (b) persons born in the colonies, dependencies, or protectorates, or portions thereof, within the Barred Zone, of France, Great Britain, the Netherlands , or Portugal, who are admissible under the immi-
gration laws of the United States as quota immigrants, will be charged to the quota of the country to which such colony or dependency belongs or by which it is administered as a protectorate.
2. The quota-area denominated "Arabian peninsula" consists of all territory except Muscat and Aden, situated in the portion of that peninsula and adjacent islands, to the southeast of Iraq , of Palestine with Trans-Jordan, and of Egypt.
3. Quota immigrants born in the British self-governing dominions or in the Empire of India, will be charged to the appropriate quota rather than to that of Great Britain and Northern Ireland . There are no quota restrictions for Canada and Newfoundland.

5. Quota immigrants eligible to citizenship in the United States , born in a colony, dependency, or protectorate of any country to which a quota applies will be charged to the quota of that country.
6.

General Note. The immigration quotas assigned to the various countries and quota-areas should not be regarded as having any political significance whatever, or as involving recognition of new governments, or of new boundaries, or of transfers of territory except as the United States Government has already made such recognition in a formal and official manner.

We approach that season of the year when it has been the customTh1a9n24k.sgiving Day, for the American people to give thanks for the good fortune which Preamble. the bounty of Providence, through the generosity of nature, has visited upon them. It is altogether a good custom. It has the
sanction of antiquity and the approbation of our religious convictions. In acknowledging the receipt of Divine favor, in contemplating the blessings which have been bestowed upon us, we shall reveal the spiritual strength of the nation.
The year has been marked by a continuation of peace whereby our country has entered into a relationship of better understanding with all the other nations of the earth. Ways have been revealed to us by which we could perform very great service through the giving of friendly counsel, through the extension of financial assistance, and through the exercise of a spirit of neighborly kindliness to less favored peoples. We should give thanks for the power which has been given into our keeping, with which we have been able to render these services to the rest of mankind .
At home we have continually had an improving state of the public health . The production of our industries has been large and our harvests have been bountiful . We have been remarkably free from
disorder and remarkably successful in all those pursuits which flourish during a state of domestic peace. An abundant prosperity has overspread the land . We shall do well to accept all these favors and bounties with a becoming humility, and dedicate them to the service of the righteous cause of the Giver of all good and perfect gifts . As the nation has prospered let all the people show that they are worthy to prosper by rededicating America to the service of God and man.
THEREFORE, I , CALVIN COOLIDGE , President of the 27T,h1u9r2s4d, adye,siNgonvaetmedbears United States of America, hereby proclaim and fix Thursday, the Thanksgiving Day. twenty-seventh day of November, as a day for National Thanksgiving. I recommend that the people gather in their places of worship, and at the family altars, and offer up their thanks for the goodness which has been shown to them in such a multitude of ways. Especially I urge them to supplicate the Throne of Grace that they may gather strength from their tribulations, that they may gain humility from their victories, that they may bear without complaining the burdens that shall be placed upon them, and that they may be increasingly worthy in all ways of the blessings that shall come to them.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand and caused to be affixed the great seal of the United States.

A PROCLAMATION

American Education

Week.

Education for the children of all the people, extending from the

Preamble.

primary grades through the university, constitutes America's noblest

contribution to civilization . No child or youth in the United States

need be deprived of the benefits of education suited to his age and

degree of advancement.

Nevertheless , either through negligence or because of unfortunate

circumstances which might be controlled with sufficient effort, large numbers of children do not receive the full preparation for their

life's work to which they are justly entitled . Many have reached maturity without even the rudiments of education.

This condition demands the solicitude of all patriotic citizens.

It involves not only the persons immediately concerned and the communities in which they live, but the Nation itself, for the welfare

of the country depends upon the character and the intelligence of those who cast the ballots .
Education has come to be nearer to the hearts of the American

people than any other single public interest. The plan of maintain-

ing educational institutions from public funds did not originally

prevail in most of the States, and even where it was in use it was

but feebly developed in the early days of the Republic. That plan did not arise spontaneously in the minds of all citizens. It was only

when the suggestion came forcefully, convincingly, and repeatedly from a few pioneers that popular interest was fully aroused . Vigorous campaigns were required not only to establish the idea of public

education, but also for its maintenance, and for its important extensions .

Campaigns of national scope in behalf of education have been conducted annually since 1920, and they have been increasingly effective with each succeeding year. They have concentrated attention upon the needs of education , and the cumulative impetus of mass action has been peculiarly beneficial. It is clearly in the interest of popular education , and consequently of the country, that these campaigns be continued with vigor.
In the last few years we have placed much emphasis on vocational training. It is necessary for men to know the practical side of life

and be able to earn a living. We want to have masters of our material resources . But it is also necessary to have a broad and liberal

culture that will enable men to think and know how to live after

they have earned a living. An educated fool is a sorry spectacle, but he is not nearly so dangerous to society as a rich fool. We want neither in this country. We want the educated to know how to work and the rich to know how to think. Urging observance of week beginning No- NOW , THEREFORE, I, Calvin Coolidge, President of the Evdeumcbaetri1o7n, aWseAemker. ican United States of America, do designate November 17th to 23rd , inclusive, as American Education Week. I urge that the citizens do all they can to advance the interests of education . It is especially recommended that the Governors of the States issue proclamations emphasizing the services rendered by their educational institutions, and calling upon their people to observe the occasion by appropriate action . Further, I urge that all civil officers whose duties relate to education, and all persons connected with the profession of teaching, exert themselves to diffuse information concerning the condition and needs of the schools and to enhance appreciation of the value
of education . Patriotic, civic, religious, social, and other organizations could contribute by conducting meetings and demonstrations to promote the desire for knowledge. Ministers of religion and members

of the press are asked to exercise the means within their power to increase enthusiasm for educational advancement and to stimulate zeal for enlightened citizenship.

Whereas in and by section 315 (c) of said act it is further provided that in ascertaining the differences in costs of production, under the provisions of subdivisions (a) and (b) of said section , the President , in so far as he finds it practicable, shall take into consideration (1) the differences in conditions in production , including wages, costs of

foreign articles in the principal markets of the United States ; (3) advantages granted to a foreign producer by a foreign government , or by a person, partnership, corporation, or association in a foreign country ; and (4) any other advantages or disadvantages in competition ;

Whereas, under and by virtue of said section of said act , the United States Tariff Commission has made an investigation to assist the President in ascertaining the differences in costs of production of and of all other facts and conditions enumerated in said section with

respect to the articles described in paragraphs 1 and 5 of Title I of said tariff act of 1922 , namely , diethylbarbituric acid and salts and compounds thereof, being wholly or in part the growth or product of the United States, and of and with respect to like or similar articles wholly or in part the growth or product of competing foreign countries ;

And whereas the President upon said investigation of said differences in costs of production of said articles wholly or in part the

growth or product of the United States and of like or similar articles

wholly or in part the growth or product of competing foreign countries, has thereby found-

That the principal competing country is Switzerland ; That the duties fixed in said title and act do not equalize the differences in costs of production in the United States and in said principal competing country, namely, Switzerland ;

That the differences in costs of production in the United States

and the principal competing country are greater than the amount

of the present duty at the rate of 25 per centum ad valorem increased by the total maximum increase authorized under said section, subdivision (a) ;

And that said differences in costs of production in the United States

and the principal competing country can not be equalized by proceding under the provisions of subdivision (a) of said section and act,

that is to say, by increasing the duties to the extent of 50 per centum

of the existing ad valorem duties applied to the value of the imported

article in the country of exportation.

Forest protection and In proclaiming American Forest Week, I desire to bring to the Arbor Day observaattention of all our people the danger that comes from the neglect tioPnr,e1a92m5b.l1 e. of our forests .
For several years the Nation has observed Forest Protection Week. It is fitting that this observance be enlarged . We have too freely spent the rich and magnificent gift that nature bestowed on us. In our eagerness to use that gift we have stripped our forests ; we have permitted fires to lay waste and devour them; we have all too often destroyed the young growth and the seed from which new forests
might spring. And though we already feel the first grip of timber shortage, we have barely begun to save and restore.
We have passed the pioneer stage and are no longer excusable for continuing this unwise dissipation of a great resource. To the
Nation it means the lack of an elemental necessity and the waste of keeping idle or only partly productive nearly one-fourth of our soil .

1988

PROCLAMATIONS , 1925.

To our forest-using industries it means unstable investments , the depletion of forest capital, the disbanding of established enterprises , and the decline of one of our most important industrial groups.
Our forests ought to be put to work and kept at work. do not
minimize the obstacles that have to be met, nor the difficulty of changing old ideas and practices. We must all put our hands to this common task. It is not enough that the Federal, State, and local governments take the lead. There must be a change in our national attitude. Our industries, our landowners, our farmers, all our citizens must learn to treat our forests as crops, to be used but also to be renewed . We must learn to tend our woodlands as carefully as we tend our farms.
Let us apply to this creative task the boundless energy and skill we have so long spent in harvesting the free gifts of nature. The
forests of the future must be started to-day. Our children are dependent on our course. We are bound by a solemn obligation from which no evasion and no subterfuge will relieve us. Unless we fulfill our sacred responsibility to unborn generations , unless we use
with gratitude and with restraint the generous and kindly gifts of Divine Providence, we shall prove ourselves unworthy guardians of a heritage we hold in trust. Designation of week ofApril 27-May 3,1925, NOW, THEREFORE , I, CALVIN COOLIDGE, President of aWseekAm, eetrci.can Forest the United States, do recommend to the Governors of the various States to designate and set apart the week of April 27-May 3, inclusive , 1925 , as American Forest Week, and, wherever practicable and not in conflict with State law or accepted customs, to celebrate Arbor Day within that week. And I urge public officials , public and business associations , industrial leaders , forest owners, editors , educators , and all patriotic citizens to unite in the common task of forest conservation and renewal.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
