Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That any person, not being an owner, who shall, on the high seas, wilfully and corruptly cast away, burn, or otherwise destroy any ship or other vessel unto which he belongeth, being the property of any citizen or citizens of the United States, or procure the same to be done, and being thereof lawfully convicted, shall suffer death.
Sec . 2. Be it further enacted, That if any person shall, on the high seas, wilfully and corruptly cast away, burn, or otherwise destroy any ship or vessel of which he is owner, in part or in whole, or in any wise direct or procure the same to be done, with intent or design to prejudice any person or persons that hath underwritten, or shall underwrite any policy or policies of insurance thereon, or if any merchant or merchants that shall load goods thereon, or of any other owner or owners of such ship or vessel, the person or persons offending therein being thereof lawfully convicted, shall be deemed and adjudged guilty of felony, and shall suffer death.
Sec . 3. And be it further enacted, That any person or persons guilty of any crime arising under the revenue laws of the United States, or incurring any fine or forfeiture by breaches of the said laws, may be prosecuted, tried and punished, provided the indictment or information be found at any time within five years after committing the offence or

(a) Destroying a vessel at sea to the injury of the underwriters. Under the second section of the act of March 26th, 1804, chap. 40, on an indictment for destroying a vessel with intent to prejudice the underwriters, it is sufficient to show the existence of an association actually carrying on the business of insurance, by whose known officers, de facto, the policy was executed, and to prejudice whom the vessel was destroyed ; without proving the existence of a legal corporation authorized to insure, or a compliance on the part of such corporation with the terms of its charter, or the validity of the policy of insurance. United States v. Amedy, 11 Wheat. 392; 6 Cond. Rep. 362.
The law not making it an offence in the owner to destroy his vessel to the prejudice of the underwriters or the cargo, no evidence can be given to establish charges against the defendant for such destruction, to the prejudice of the underwriters on the cargo, even if the indictment contained such a charge. Evidence of the value of the property insured may be given to show inducements to destroy or preserve it. The United States v. Richard Johns, 1 Wash. C. C. R. 363.
It is necessary in the indictment to state that the intent was to prejudice the underwriters. Ibid. The prosecutor on an indictment for destroying a vessel, must show that the insurance is a valid insurance, and if made by an incorporated insurance company, the act of incorporation must be shown, and the contract of insurance must be shown to have been executed. Ibid. The legal meaning of the term " destroy" by the act of Congress is to unfit the vessel for service beyond the hope of ordinary means. This, as to the extent of the injury, is synonymous with " cast away." Both mean, such an act as causes the vessel to perish and to be lost, or to be irrecoverable by ordinary means. Ibid.

The United States, on the trial of the case in the circuit court, denied the right of the defendant to these commissions, as they had not been allowed to him by any department of the government, and asserted that the jury had not power to allow them on the trial.

Had the claim never been presented to the department, it could not have been admitted as evidence by the court. But, as it had been made out in form and presented to the proper accounting officers, and had been rejected, the circuit court did right in submitting it to the jury, if the claim was considered as equitable.

The said district of Louisiana shall be divided into districts by the governor, under the direction of the President, as the convenience of the settlements shall require, subject to such alterations hereafter as experience may prove more convenient. The inhabitants of each district, between the ages of eighteen and forty-five, shall be formed into a militia, with proper officers, according to their numbers, to be appointed by the governor, except the commanding officer, who shall be appointed by the President, and who whether a captain, a major or a colonel, shall be the commanding officer of the district, and as such, shall, under the

() Decisions of the Supreme Court on Louisiana land titles :--By the treaty of St. Ildefonso, made on the 1st of October, 1800, Spain ceded Louisiana to France; and France, by the treaty of Paris, signed the 30th of April, 1803, ceded it to the United States. Under this treaty the United States claimed the countries between the Iberville and the Perdido.. Spain contended that her cession to France comprehended only that territory which at the time of the cession was denominated Louisiana, consisting of the island of New Orleans, and the country which had been originally ceded to her by France, west of the Mississippi. The land claimed by the plaintiffs in error, under a grant from the crown of Spain, made after the treaty of St. Ildefonso, lies within the disputed territory; and this case presents the question, to whom did the country between the Iberville and Perdido belong after the treaty of St. Ildefonso ? Had France and Spain agreed upon the boundaries of the retroceded territory, before Louisiana was acquired by the United States, that agreement would undoubtedly have ascertained its limits. But the declarations of France, made after parting with the province, cannot be admitted as conclusive. In questions of this character, political considerations have too much influence over the conduct of nations, to permit their declarations to decide the course of an independent government, in a matter vitally interesting to itself. Foster et al. v. Neilson, 2 Peters, 254.
If a Spanish grantee had obtained possession of the land in dispute so as to be the defendant, would a court of the United States maintain his title under a Spanish grant, made subsequent to the acquisition of Louisiana, singly on the principle that the Spanish construction of the treaty of St. Ildefonso was right, and the American construction wrong ? Such a decision would subvert those principles which govern the relations between the legislative and judicial departments, and mark the limits of each. Ibid.
The sound construction of the 8th article of the treaty between the United States and Spain, of the 22d of February, 1829, will not enable the court to apply its provisions to the case of the plaintiff. Ibid.
The article does not declare that all the grants made by his Catholic majesty before the 24th of January, 1818, shall be valid to the same extent as if the ceded territories had remained under his dominion. It does not say that those grants are hereby confirmed. Had such been its language, it would have acted directly on the subject, and it would have repealed those acts of Congress which were repugnant to it; but its language is that those grants shall be ratified and confirmed to the persons in possession, &c. By whom shall they be ratified and confirmed ? This seems to be the language of contract; and if it is, the ratification and confirmation which are promised must be the act of the legislature. Until such act shall be passed, the court is not at liberty to disregard the existing laws on the subject. Ibid.
The controversy in relation to the country lying between the Mississippi and the Perdido rivers, and the validity of the grants made by Spain in the disputed territory, after the cession of Louisiana to the United States, were carefully examined and decided in the case of Foster and Elam v. Neilson. The supreme court, in that case, decided that the question of boundary between the United States and Spain was a question for the political departments of the government; that the legislative and executive branches having decided the question, the courts of the United States are bound to regard the boundary determined by them as the true one; that grants made by the Spanish authorities of lands, which, according to this boundary line belonged to the United States, gave no title to the grantees, in opposition to those claiming under the United States ; unless the Spanish grants were protected by the subsequent arrangements made between the two governments; and that no such arrangements were to be found in the treaty of 1819, by which Spain ceded the Floridas to the United States, according to the fair import of its words, and its true construction. Garcia v. Lee, 12 Peters, 511.
In the case of Foster and Elam v. Neilson, the supreme court said, that the Florida treaty of 1819 declares that all grants made before the 24th January, 1818, by the Spanish authorities, " shall be ratified and confirmed to the persons in possession of the lands, to the same extent that the same grants would be valid, if the territories had remained under the dominion of his Catholic majesty and in deciding the case of Foster and Elam, the court held that even if this stipulation applied to lands in the territory in question, yet the words used did not import a present confirmation by virtue of the treaty itself, but that they were words of contract; "that the ratification and confirmation, which were promised, must be the act of the legislature ; and until such shall be passed, the court is not at liberty to disregard the existing laws on the subject." Afterwards, in the case of the United States v. Percheman, 7 Peters, 86, in reviewing the words of the eighth article of the treaty, the court, for the reasons there assigned, came to a different conclusion; and held that the words were words of present confirmation, by the treaty, where the land had been rightfully granted before the cession ; and that it did not need the aid of an act of Congress to ratify and confirm the grant. This language was, however, applied by the court, and was intended to apply to grants made in a territory which belonged to Spain at the time of the grant. The case then before the court was one of that description. It was in relation to a grant of land in Florida, which unquestionably belonged to Spain at the time the grant was made ; and where the Spanish authorities had an undoubted right to grant, until the treaty of cession in 1819. It is of such grants that the court speak, when they declare them to be confirmed and protected by the true construction of the treaty; and that they do not need the aid of an act of Congress to ratify and confirm the title of the purchaser. The court do not apply this principle to grants made within the territory of Louisiana. The case of Foster and Elam v. Neilson, must in all other respects be considered as affirmed by the case of Percheman ; as it underwent a careful examination in that case, and as none of its principles were, questioned, except that referred to. Garcia v. Lee, 12 Peters, 511.
The acts of the commissioners appointed to adjust and settle land titles in Louisiana, under the acts of Congress authorizing and confirming the same, are conclusive as to all titles to lands which have been confirmed, according to the provisions of the different acts of Congress on the subject. Strother v. Lucas, 12 Peters, 410. See also The United States v. Percheman, 7 Peters, 86.

tained shall not be construed to make null and void any bona fide grant, made agreeably to the laws, usages and customs of the Spanish government to an actual settler on the lands so granted, for himself, and for his wife and family; or to make null and void any bona fide act or proceeding done by an actual settler agreeably to the laws, usages and
customs of the Spanish government, to obtain a grant for lands actually settled on by the person or persons claiming title thereto, if such settlement in either case was actually made prior to the twentieth day of December, one thousand eight hundred and three: Andprovidedfurther. that such grant shall not secure to the grantee or his assigns more than one mile square of land, together with such other and further quantity as heretofore hath been allowed for the wife and family of such actual settler, agreeably to the laws, usages and customs of the Spanish government. And that if any citizen of the United States, or other person, shall make a settlement on any lands belonging to the United States, within the limits of Louisiana, or shall survey, or attempt to survey, such lands, or to designate boundaries by marking trees, or otherwise, such offender shall, on conviction thereof, in any court of record of the United States, or the territories of the United States, forfeit a sum not exceeding one thousand dollars, and suffer imprisonment not exceeding
twelve months; and it shall, moreover, be lawful for the President of the United States to employ such military force as he may judge necessary to remove from lands belonging to the United States any such citizen or other person, who shall attempt a settlement thereon.
Sec . 15.

Statu te I.

Cha p. LXI.--An diet supplementary to the act intituled "An act regulating the
grants of land, and providing for the disposal of the lands of the United States,
south of the state of Tennessee.''(a)
Beit enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That persons claiming lands in the Mississippi territory, by virtue of any British or Spanish grant, or by virtue of the three first sections of the act to which this is a supplement, or of the articles of agreement and cession with the state of Georgia, may, after the last day of March, in the year one thousand eight hundred and four, and until the last day of November, then next following, give notice in writing, of their claims, to the register of the land-office, for the lands lying west of Pearl river, and have the same recorded in the manner prescribed by the fifth section of the act to which this is a supplement: Provided however, that where lands are claimed by virtue of a complete Spanish or British grant, in conformity with the articles of agreement and cession between the United States and the state of Georgia, it shall not be necessary for the claimant to have any other evidence of his claim recorded, except the original grant or patent, together with the warrant or order of survey and the plot; but all the subsequent conveyances or deeds shall be deposited with the register, to be by him laid before the commissioners when they shall take the claim into consideration: and the powers vested by law in the

March 27, 1804. Act of March
3, 1803, ch. 27. Notice to be
given to the re gister of the land-office by persons claiming lands in the Mississippi ter ritory west of Pearl river, and their claims to be recorded.
Proviso in favor of Spanish and British grants.

(a) Under the act of Congress of March 3, 1803, chap. 27, entitled, " An act regulating grants of lands, and providing for the disposal of the lands of the United States south of the state of Tennessee," such lands only were authorized to be offered for sale as had not been appropriated by the previous sections of the law, and certificates granted in pursuance thereof. A right therefore to a particular grant of land, derived from a donation certificate given under the law, is superior to the title of any one who purchased the same land at the public sales, unless there is some fatal infirmity in the certificate which renders it void. Ross v. Barland et al., 1 Peters, 666.
The act of Congress requires no precise form for the donation certificate. It is sufficient if the proofs be exhibited to the court of the commissioners to satisfy them of the facts entitling the party to the certificate. It is sufficient if the consideration, the occupancy, and the quantity granted appears: nothing more is necessary to certify to the government the party's right, or to enable him, after it is surveyed by the proper officer, to obtain a patent. Ibid.
The 2d section of the act of March 3, 1803, was intended to confer a bounty on a numerous class of individuals ; and in construing the ambiguous words of the section, it is the duty of the court to adopt that construction which will best effect the liberal intentions of the legislature. Ibid.
The time when the territory over which the law operated was evacuated by the Spanish troops, was very important, as the law was intended to provide for those who were actually, at that time, inhabitants of, and cultivated the soil within it; but whether it was in 1797 or 1798, was comparatively unimportant. The decision of the commissioners upon the period when the evacuation took place is sufficient; and the court are disposed to adopt the construction of the act given by the commissioners, west of Pearl river, that the evacuation took place on the 30th March, 1798, by which persons claiming within the objects of the section were entitled to certificates. Ibid.
Congress have treated as erroneous the construction given to the law by the commissioners to settle claims to lands east of Pearl river; who have decided that only those who have settled on the lands within the territory in the year 1797, were entitled to donation certificates, and who had granted to others preemption certificates. Ibid.
The commissioners appointed under the act of Congress relative to claims to lands south of the state of Tennessee, were authorized to hear evidence as to the time of the actual evacuation of the territory by the Spanish troops, and to decide upon the fact. The law gave them power to hear and decide all matters respecting such claims, and to determine thereon according to justice and equity, and declared their deliberations shall be final. The court are bound to presume that every fact necessary to warrant the certificate in the terms of it, was proved before the commissioners; and that subsequently it was shown to them that the final evacuation of the territory took place on the 30th March, 1798. Ibid.
It is the settled doctrine of the judicial department of the government of the United States, that the treaty of 1819 with Spain, ceded to the United States, no territory west of the Perdido river. It had already been acquired under the Louisiana treaty. Pollard's Lessee v. Files, 2 Howard's Sup. Court Rep. 591.
In the interval between the Louisiana treaty, and the time when the United States took possession of the territory west of the Perdido, the Spanish government had a right to grant permits to settle and improve by cultivation, and to authorize the erection of establishments for mechanical purposes. Ibid.
These incipient concessions were not regarded by Congress, but are recognized in the acts of 1804, 1812, 1819, and as claims are within the acts of 1824. Ibid.

Statu te I.

Cha p. LXI.--An diet supplementary to the act intituled "An act regulating the
grants of land, and providing for the disposal of the lands of the United States,
south of the state of Tennessee.''(a)
Beit enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That persons claiming lands in the Mississippi territory, by virtue of any British or Spanish grant, or by virtue of the three first sections of the act to which this is a supplement, or of the articles of agreement and cession with the state of Georgia, may, after the last day of March, in the year one thousand eight hundred and four, and until the last day of November, then next following, give notice in writing, of their claims, to the register of the land-office, for the lands lying west of Pearl river, and have the same recorded in the manner prescribed by the fifth section of the act to which this is a supplement: Provided however, that where lands are claimed by virtue of a complete Spanish or British grant, in conformity with the articles of agreement and cession between the United States and the state of Georgia, it shall not be necessary for the claimant to have any other evidence of his claim recorded, except the original grant or patent, together with the warrant or order of survey and the plot; but all the subsequent conveyances or deeds shall be deposited with the register, to be by him laid before the commissioners when they shall take the claim into consideration: and the powers vested by law in the

3, 1803, ch. 27. Notice to be
given to the re gister of the land-office by persons claiming lands in the Mississippi ter ritory west of Pearl river, and their claims to be recorded.
Proviso in favor of Spanish and British grants.

(a) Under the act of Congress of March 3, 1803, chap. 27, entitled, " An act regulating grants of lands, and providing for the disposal of the lands of the United States south of the state of Tennessee," such lands only were authorized to be offered for sale as had not been appropriated by the previous sections of the law, and certificates granted in pursuance thereof. A right therefore to a particular grant of land, derived from a donation certificate given under the law, is superior to the title of any one who purchased the same land at the public sales, unless there is some fatal infirmity in the certificate which renders it void. Ross v. Barland et al., 1 Peters, 666.
The act of Congress requires no precise form for the donation certificate. It is sufficient if the proofs be exhibited to the court of the commissioners to satisfy them of the facts entitling the party to the certificate. It is sufficient if the consideration, the occupancy, and the quantity granted appears: nothing more is necessary to certify to the government the party's right, or to enable him, after it is surveyed by the proper officer, to obtain a patent. Ibid.
The 2d section of the act of March 3, 1803, was intended to confer a bounty on a numerous class of individuals ; and in construing the ambiguous words of the section, it is the duty of the court to adopt that construction which will best effect the liberal intentions of the legislature. Ibid.
The time when the territory over which the law operated was evacuated by the Spanish troops, was very important, as the law was intended to provide for those who were actually, at that time, inhabitants of, and cultivated the soil within it; but whether it was in 1797 or 1798, was comparatively unimportant. The decision of the commissioners upon the period when the evacuation took place is sufficient; and the court are disposed to adopt the construction of the act given by the commissioners, west of Pearl river, that the evacuation took place on the 30th March, 1798, by which persons claiming within the objects of the section were entitled to certificates. Ibid.
Congress have treated as erroneous the construction given to the law by the commissioners to settle claims to lands east of Pearl river; who have decided that only those who have settled on the lands within the territory in the year 1797, were entitled to donation certificates, and who had granted to others preemption certificates. Ibid.
The commissioners appointed under the act of Congress relative to claims to lands south of the state of Tennessee, were authorized to hear evidence as to the time of the actual evacuation of the territory by the Spanish troops, and to decide upon the fact. The law gave them power to hear and decide all matters respecting such claims, and to determine thereon according to justice and equity, and declared their deliberations shall be final. The court are bound to presume that every fact necessary to warrant the certificate in the terms of it, was proved before the commissioners; and that subsequently it was shown to them that the final evacuation of the territory took place on the 30th March, 1798. Ibid.
It is the settled doctrine of the judicial department of the government of the United States, that the treaty of 1819 with Spain, ceded to the United States, no territory west of the Perdido river. It had already been acquired under the Louisiana treaty. Pollard's Lessee v. Files, 2 Howard's Sup. Court Rep. 591.
In the interval between the Louisiana treaty, and the time when the United States took possession of the territory west of the Perdido, the Spanish government had a right to grant permits to settle and improve by cultivation, and to authorize the erection of establishments for mechanical purposes. Ibid.
These incipient concessions were not regarded by Congress, but are recognized in the acts of 1804, 1812, 1819, and as claims are within the acts of 1824. Ibid.

A TREATY

Between the United States of America and the Delaware tribe of Indians.
The Delaware tribe of Indians finding that the annuity which they receive from the United States, is not sufficient to supply them with the articles which are necessary for their comfort and convenience, and afford the means of introducing amongst them the arts of civilised life, and being convinced that the extensiveness of the country they possess, by giving an opportunity to their hunting parties to ramble to a great distance from their towns, is the principal means of retarding this desirable event; and the United States being desirous to connect their settlements on the Wabash with the state of Kentucky: therefore the said United States, by William Henry Harrison, governor of the Indiana territory, superintendent of Indian affairs, and their commissioner plenipotentiary for treating with the Indian tribes northwest of the Ohio river; and the said tribe of Indians, by their sachems, chiefs, and head warriors, have agreed to the following articles, which when ratified by the President of the United States, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall be binding on the said parties.
Art ic le 1. The said Delaware tribe, for the considerations hereinafter mentioned, relinquishes to the United States forever, all their right and title to the tract of country which lies between the Ohio and Wabash rivers, and below the tract ceded by the treaty of Fort Wayne, and the road leading from Vincennes to the falls of Ohio.
Art . 2. The said tribe shall receive from the United States for ten years, an additional annuity of three hundred dollars, which is to be exclusively appropriated to the purpose of ameliorating their condition and promoting their civilization. Suitable persons shall be employed at the expence of the United States to teach them to make fences, cultivate the earth, and such of the domestic arts as are adapted to their situation; and a further sum of three hundred dollars shall be appropriated annually for five years to this object. The United States will cause to be delivered to them in the course of the next spring, horses fit for draft, cattle, hogs and implements of husbandry to the amount of four hundred dollars. The preceding stipulations together with goods to the amount of eight hundred dollars which is now delivered to the said tribe, (a part of which is to be appropriated to the satisfying certain individuals of the said tribe, whose horses have been taken by white

people) is to be considered as full compensation for the relinquishment made in the first article.

Stolen horses to be restored.
Right of the Delawares to lands, &c.

Art . 3. As there is great reason to believe that there are now in the possession of the said tribe, several horses which have been stolen from citizens of the United States, the chiefs who represent the said tribe are to use their utmost endeavors to have the said horses forthwith delivered to the superintendent of Indian affairs or such persons as he may appoint to receive them. And as the United States can place the utmost reliance on the honour and integrity of those chiefs who have manifested a punctilious regard to the engagements entered into at the treaty of Grenville, it is agreed that in relation to such of the horses stolen as aforesaid, but which have died or been removed beyond the reach of the chiefs, the United States will compensate the owners for the loss of them without deducting from the annuity of the said tribe the amount of what may be paid in this way. But it is expressly understood that this provision is not to extend to any horses which have been stolen within the course of twelve months preceding the date hereof.
Art . 4. The said tribe having exhibited to the above-named commissioner of the United States sufficient proof of their right to all the country which lies between the Ohio and White river, and the Miami tribe who were the original proprietors of the upper part of that country having explicitly acknowledged the title of the Delawares at the general council held at Fort Wayne in the month of June 1803, the said United States will in future consider the Delawares as the rightful owners of all the country which is bounded by the white river on the north, the Ohio on the south, the general boundary line running from the mouth of the Kentucky river on the east, and the tract ceded by this treaty, and that ceded by the treaty of Fort Wayne, on the west and south west.

Stipulation that the U. S. will treat with the Piankeshaws for an acknowledgment of the title of the Delawares, &c.

Art . 5. As the Piankishaw tribe have hitherto obstinately persisted in refusing to recognize the title of the Delawares to the tract of country ceded by this treaty, the United States will negociate with them and will endeavor to settle the matter, in an amicable way; but should they reject the propositions that may be made to them on this subject, and should the United States not think proper to take possession of the said country without their consent; the stipulations and promises herein made on behalf of the United States, shall be null and void.

Boundaries, &c.

Art . 6. As the road from Vincennes to Clark's grant will form a very inconvenient boundery, and as it is the intention of the parties to these presents that the whole of the said road shall be within the tract ceded to the United States, it is agreed that the boundary in that quarter shall be a straight line to be drawn parallel to the course of the said road from the eastern boundary of the tracts ceded by the treaty of Fort Wayne to Clark's grant; but the said line is not to pass at a greater distance than half a mile from the most northerly bend of said road.

In witness whereof the commissioner plenipotentiary of the United States, and the chiefs and head men of the said tribe have hereunto set their hands, and affixed their seals. Done at Vincennes the eighteenth day of August, in the year of our Lord one thousand
eight hundred and four; and of the independence of the United States, the twenty-ninth.

And it shall be the duty of the said chiefs upon complaint being made as aforesaid to deliver up the person or persons against whom the complaint is made, to the end that he or they may be punished agreeably to the laws of the state or territory where the offence may have been committed; and in like manner if any robery, violence or murder shall be committed on any Indian or Indians belonging to the said tribes or either of them, the person or persons so offending shall be tried, and if found guilty, punished in the like manner as if the injury had been done to a white man. And it is further agreed, that the chiefs of the said tribes shall, to the utmost of their power exert themselves to recover horses or other property which may be stolen from any citizen or citizens of the United States by any individual or individuals of their tribes, and the property so recovered shall be forthwith delivered to the superintendant or other person authorised to receive it, that it may be restored to the proper owner ; and in cases where the exertions of the chiefs shall be ineffectual in recovering the property stolen as aforesaid, if sufficient proof can be

None but authorized traders to reside among the Saukes ana and Foxes.

Art . 8. As the laws of the United States regulating trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes, are already extended to the country inhabited by the Saukes and Foxes, and as it is provided by those laws that no person shall reside as a trader in the Indian country without a license under the hand [and] seal of the superintendant of Indian affairs, or other person appointed for the purpose by the President, the said tribes do promise and agree that they will not suffer any trader to reside amongst them without such license; and that they will from time to time give notice to the superintendant or to the agent for their tribes of all the traders that may be in their country.

And the said tribes do further agree, that they will at all times allow to traders and other persons travelling through their country under the authority of the United States a free and safe passage for themselves and their property of every discription.
