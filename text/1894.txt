[No. 40.] Joint Resolution To establish, an observatory circle as a provision for guarding the delicate astronomical instruments at the United States Naval Observatory against smoke or currents of heated air in their neighborhood and undue vibrations from traffic upon the extension of public thoroughfares in the vicinity,

and for other purposes.


Preamble.

Whereas in order to insure within practicable limits the success of astronomical observations, it is of the highest importance that the

delicate instruments employed in that work be guarded against smoke or currents of heated air in their neighborhood, and also against undue vibrations from traffic upon public thoroughfares, all of which can only be attained by controlling a reasonable area of ground in the immediate vicinity of the buildings wherein the said instruments are mounted ;

and Whereas from experiments it has been ascertained that a circle
described with a radius of one thousand feet from a central point of the said buildings is the least inclosure that will accomplish such desired protection: Therefore,

Naval Observatorj'. No street, etc.,within 1,000 feet of clock room. Massachusetts avenue. Right of way through grounds.

CHAP. 97.--An Act For the relief of Captain John W. Pullman.
Whereas John W. Pullman, who was commissioned a second lieutenant of the Eighth Cavalry in the United States Army on the fifteenth day of June, eighteen hundred and sixty-nine, and consequently commissioned a captain in the Quartermaster's Department; and
Whereas Honorable W. A. Day, on the twelfth day of June, eighteen hundred and eighty-nine, then the Second Auditor of the Treasury of the United States, prepared a revised statement of Captain Pullman's account, finding due the said John W. Pullman the sum of one thousand three hundred and ninety-six dollars and thirty-one cents, and on the same day certified the result to the Second Comptroller of the Treasury for payment, which was subsequently returned to the Second Auditor without any decision, and "without prejudice" by him, inasmuch as Attorney-General Miller had expressed an opinion that a previous receipt given by Captain Pullman for an amount that the accounting officer had erroneously adjudged his due, estopped him from receiving the portion that had been erroneously and unlawfully previously withheld, supporting such opinion by the declaration that "had it happened through a mistake of law of the accounting officer of the United States the captain had been paid too much instead of too little, it would seem quite clear that the excess could not be recovered back:" Therefore,

CHAP. 241.--An Act For the relief of Charles B. Stivers.

Preamble. Charles B. Stivers. May be appointed captain, Army retired list.

Whereas Charles B. Stivers, late captain in the Seventh United States Infantry, was summarily and erroneously dismissed the service on the fifteenth day of July, eighteen hundred and sixty three, by Special Orders, Numbered Three hundred and thirteen, by order of the then Secretary of War, which order of dismissal, upon proof being made to the War Department that an injustice had been inadvertently done the said officer, was revoked by order of the Secretary of War on August eleventh, eighteen hundred and sixty-three, by Special Orders, Numbered Three hundred and fifty-six, whereupon said Captain Stivers was restored to his rank in the Army and continued in honorable and faithful service therein until December thirtieth, eighteen hundred and sixty-four, when, by a proper order from the War Department, after due examination, on account of long and faithful service and physical disability, he was placed upon the retired list of the Army; and
Whereas the said Charles B. Stivers was continued upon said retired list from the said date of his retirement until June first, eighteen hundred and ninety, when he was dropped from the same in pursuance of an order of the War Department made by reason of the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States (One hundred and fourteenth United States Report, six hundred and nineteen) to the effect that the revocation by the President by an order of dismissal of an officer of the Army did not restore him to his former position in the service, but that such restoration could only legally be effected by an Act of Congress: Therefore,
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the provisions of law regulating appointments in the Army by promotion in the line are hereby suspended for the purpose of this Act only, and only so far as they affect Charles B. Stivers; and the President of the United States is hereby authorized, in the exercise of his discretion and judgment, to nominate and, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to appoint said Charles B. Stivers, late a captain in the Seventh United States Infantry Regiment, to the same grade and rank of captain in the Army of the United States in the infantry service, and to place him on the retired list of the Army as of the date of December thirtieth, eighteen hundred and sixty-four, the retired list being thereby increased in number to that extent, with the pay of his grade and rank from said date the same as if he had never been considered out of the service since his original entrance therein; such retired pay, however, having been heretofore duly and continuously received by said Charles B,

CHAP. 241.--An Act For the relief of Charles B. Stivers.

Preamble. Charles B. Stivers. May be appointed captain, Army retired list.

Whereas Charles B. Stivers, late captain in the Seventh United States Infantry, was summarily and erroneously dismissed the service on the fifteenth day of July, eighteen hundred and sixty three, by Special Orders, Numbered Three hundred and thirteen, by order of the then Secretary of War, which order of dismissal, upon proof being made to the War Department that an injustice had been inadvertently done the said officer, was revoked by order of the Secretary of War on August eleventh, eighteen hundred and sixty-three, by Special Orders, Numbered Three hundred and fifty-six, whereupon said Captain Stivers was restored to his rank in the Army and continued in honorable and faithful service therein until December thirtieth, eighteen hundred and sixty-four, when, by a proper order from the War Department, after due examination, on account of long and faithful service and physical disability, he was placed upon the retired list of the Army; and
Whereas the said Charles B. Stivers was continued upon said retired list from the said date of his retirement until June first, eighteen hundred and ninety, when he was dropped from the same in pursuance of an order of the War Department made by reason of the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States (One hundred and fourteenth United States Report, six hundred and nineteen) to the effect that the revocation by the President by an order of dismissal of an officer of the Army did not restore him to his former position in the service, but that such restoration could only legally be effected by an Act of Congress: Therefore,
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the provisions of law regulating appointments in the Army by promotion in the line are hereby suspended for the purpose of this Act only, and only so far as they affect Charles B. Stivers; and the President of the United States is hereby authorized, in the exercise of his discretion and judgment, to nominate and, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to appoint said Charles B. Stivers, late a captain in the Seventh United States Infantry Regiment, to the same grade and rank of captain in the Army of the United States in the infantry service, and to place him on the retired list of the Army as of the date of December thirtieth, eighteen hundred and sixty-four, the retired list being thereby increased in number to that extent, with the pay of his grade and rank from said date the same as if he had never been considered out of the service since his original entrance therein; such retired pay, however, having been heretofore duly and continuously received by said Charles B,

Preamble.

Whereas, a Convention between the United States of America and China, concerning the subject of emigration between those two countries, was concluded and signed by their respective Plenipotentiaries at the City of Washington on the 17th day of March, one thousand eight hundred and ninety-four, which Convention is word for word as follows:

Contracting parties. Vol. 22, p. 826. Plenipotentiaries.

Whereas, on the 17th day of November A. D. 1880, and of Kwanghsii, the sixth year, tenth moon, fifteenth day, a Treaty was concluded between the United States and China for the purpose of regulating, limiting, or suspending the coming of Chinese laborers to, and their residence in, the United States;
And whereas the Government of China, in view of the antagonism and much deprecated and serious disorders to which the presence of Chinese laborers has given rise in certain parts of the United States, desires to prohibit the emigration of such laborers from China to the United States;
And whereas the two Governments desire to cooperate in prohibiting such emigration, and to strengthen in other ways the bonds of friendship between the two countries;
And whereas the two Governments are desirous of adopting reciprocal measures for the better protection of the citizens or subjects of each within the jurisdiction of the other;
Now, therefore, the President of the United States has appointed Walter Q. Gresham, Secretary of State of the United States, as his Plenipotentiary, and His Imperial Majesty, the Emperor of China has appointed Yang Yii, Officer of the second rank, Sub-Director of the Court of Sacrificial Worship, and Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the United States of America, as his Plenipotentiary; and the said Plenipotentiaries having exhibited their respective Full Powers found to be in due and good form, have agreed upon the following articles:

Nevertheless every such Chinese laborer shall, before leaving the United States, deposit, as a condition of his return, with the collector of customs of the district from which he departs, a full description in writing of his family, or property, or debts, as aforesaid, and shall be furnished by said collector with such certificate of his right to return under this Treaty as the laws of the United States may now or hereafter prescribe and not inconsistent with the provisions of this Treaty; and should the written description aforesaid be proved to be false, the right of return thereunder, or of continued residence after Return, shall in each case be forfeited. And such right of return to the United States shall be exercised within one year from the date of leaving the United States; but such right of return to the United States may be extended for an additional period, not to exceed one year, in cases where by reason of sickness or other cause of disability beyond his control, such Chinese laborer shall be rendered unable sooner to return-- which facts shall be fully reported to the Chinese consul at the port of departure, and by him certified, to the satisfaction of the collector of the port at which such Chinese subject shall land in the United States. And no such Chinese laborer shall be permitted to enter the United States by land or sea without producing to the proper officer of the
customs the return certificate herein required.

Sec . 3. No citizen of the United States or person above described, in the first section of this Act, shall, during the period and in the waters in which by section two of this Act the killing of fur seals is not prohibited, use or employ any vessel, nor shall any vessel of the United States be nsed or employed, in carrying on or taking part in fur-seal fishing operations, other than a sailing vessel propelled by sails exclusively, and such canoes or undecked boats, propelled by paddles, oars, or sails as may belong to, and be used in connection with, such sailing vessels; nor shall any sailing vessel carry on or take part in such operations without a special license obtained from the government for that purpose, and without carrying a distinctive flag prescribed by the government for the same purpose.

Sec . 7.

Sec . 12. That any vessel or citizen of the United States, or person described in the first section of this Act, offending against the prohibitions of this Act or the regulations thereunder, may be seized and detained by the naval or other duly commissioned officers of Her Majesty the Queen of Great Britain, but when so seized and detained they shall be delivered as soon as practicable, with any witnesses and proofs on board, to any naval or revenue officer or other authorities of the United States, whose courts alone shall have jurisdiction to try the offense and impose the penalties for the same: Provided, however, That British officers shall arrest and detain vessels and persons as in this section specified only after, by appropriate legislation, Great Britain shall have authorized officers of the United States duly commissioned and instructed by the President to that end to arrest, detain, and deliver to the authorities of Great Britain vessels and subjects of that Government offending against any statutes or regulations of Great Britain enacted or made to enforce the award of the treaty mentioned in the title of this Act."

Whereas, By reason of unlawful obstructions, combinations and assemblages of persons, it has become impracticable in the judgment of the President to enforce by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings, the laws of the United States within the State of Illinois and especially in the City of Chicago within said State:
And, Whereas, for the purpose of enforcing the faithful execution of the laws of the United States and protecting its property and removing obstructions to the United States mails in the State and City aforesaid, the President has employed a part of the military forces of the United
States: Now, therefore, I, Grover Cleveland, President of the United States,
do hereby admonish all good citizens and all persons who may be or may come within the City and State aforesaid, against aiding, countenancing, encouraging, or taking any partin such unlawful obstructions, combinations and assemblages; and I hereby warn all persons engaged in or in any way connected with such unlawful obstructions, combinations and assemblages to disperse and retire peaceably to their respective abodes on or before twelve o'clock noon on the ninth day of July
instant. Those who disregard this warning and persist in taking part with a
riotous mob in forcibly resisting and obstructing the execution of the laws of the United States, or interfering with the functions of the government or destroying or attempting to destroy the property belonging to the United States or under its protection, cannot be regarded otherwise than as public enemies.
Troops employed against such a riotous mob, will act with all the moderation and forbearance consistent with the accomplishment of the desired end; but the stern necessities that confront them will not with certainty permit discrimination between guilty participants and those who are mingled with them from curiosity and without criminal intent. The only safe course therefore for those not actually unlawfully participating is to abide at their homes, or at least not to be found in the neighborhood of riotous assemblages.
While there will be no hesitation or vacillation in the decisive treatment of the guilty, this warning is especially intended to protect and save the innocent.
In Testimony Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be hereto affixed.

(b) On the starboard side a green light so constructed as to show an unbroken light over an arc of the horizon of ten points of the compass, so fixed as to throw the light from right ahead to two points abaft the beam on the starboard side, and of such a character as to be visible at a distance of at least two miles.
(c) On the port side a red light so constructed as to show an unbroken light over an arc of the horizon of ten points of the compass, so fixed as to throw the light from right ahead to two points abaft the beam on the port side, and of such a character as to be visible at a distance of at least two miles.
(d) The said green and red side-lights shall be fitted with inboard screens projecting at least three feet forward from the light, so as to prevent these lights from being seen across the bow.
(e) A steam-vessel when under way may carry an additional white light similar in construction to the light mentioned in subdivision (a). These two lights shall be so placed in line with the keel that one shall be at least fifteen feet higher than the other, and in such a position with reference to each other that the lower light shall be forward of the upper one. The vertical distance between these lights shall be less than the horizontal distance.
Art . 3. A steam-vessel when towing another vessel shall, in addition to her sidelights, carry two bright white lights in a vertical line one over the other, not less than six feet apart, and when towing more than one vessel shall carry an additional bright white light six feet above or below such light, if the length of the tow measuring from the stern of the towing vessel to the stern of the last vessel towed exceeds six hundred feet. Each of these lights shall be of the same construction and character, and shall be carried in the same position as the white light mentioned in article two (a), excepting the additional light, which may be carried at a height of not less than fourteen feet above the hull.
Such steam-vessel may carry a small white light abaft the funnel or aftermast for the vessel towed to steer by, but such light shall not be visible forward of the beam.
Art . 4. (a) A vessel which from any accident is not under command shall carry at the same height as a white light mentioned in article two (a), where they can best be seen, and if a steam-vessel in lieu of that light, two red lights, in a vertical line one over the other, not less than six feet apart, and of such a character as to be visible all around the horizon at a distance of at least two miles; and shall by day carry in a vertical line one over the other, not less than six feet apart, where they can best be seen, two black balls or shapes, each two feet in diameter.
(b) A vessel employed in laying or in picking up a telegraph cable shall carry in the same position as the white light mentioned in article two (a), and if a steamvessel in lieu of that light, three lights in a vertical line one over the other not less than six feet apart.

(c) The vessels referred to in this article, when not making way through the water, shall not carry the side-lights, but when making way shall carry them.
(d) The lights and shapes required to be shown by this article are to be taken by other vessels as signals that the vessel showing them is not under command and can not therefore get out of the way.
These signals are not signals of vessels in distress and requiring assistance. Such signals are contained in article thirty-one.
Art . 5. A sailing vessel under way and any vessel being towed shall carry the same lights as are prescribed by article two for a steam-vessel under way, with the exception of the white lights mentioned therein, which they shall never carry.

On the near approach of or to othervessels they shall have their side-lights lighted, ready for use, and shall flash or show them at short intervals, to indicate the direction in which they are heading, but the green light shall not be shown on the port side, nor the red light on the starboard side. A pilot-vessel of such a class as to be obliged to go alongside of a vessel to put a pilot on board may show the white light instead of carrying it at the masthead, and may, instead of the colored lights above mentioned, have at hand, ready for use, a lantern with a green glass on the one side and a red glass on the other, to be used as prescribed above. Pilot-vessels when not engaged on their station on pilotage duty shall carry lights similar to those of other vessels of their tonnage. Art . 9. Fishing vessels and fishing boats when under way and when not required by this article to carry or show the lights therein named shall carry or show the lights prescribed for vessels of their tonnage under way. (a) Vessels and boats, when fishing with drift nets, shall exhibit two white lights from any part of the vessel where they can best be seen. Such lights shall be placed so that the vertical distance between them shall be not less than six feet and not more than ten feet, and so that the horizontal distance between them, measured in a line with the keel, shall be not less than five feet and not more than ten feet. The lower of these two lights shall be the more forward, and both of them shall be of such a character as to show all around the horizon, and to be visible at a distance of not less than three miles. (b) Vessels, when engaged in trawling, by which is meant the dragging of an apparatus along the the bottom of the sea-- First. If steam-vessels, shall carry in the same position as the white light mentioned in article two (a) a tricolored lantern so constructed and fixed as to show a white light from right ahead to two points on each bow, and a green light and a-red light over an arc of the horizon from two points on either bow to two points abaft the beam on the starboard and port sides, respectively; and, not less than six nor more than twelve feet below the tricolored lantern, a white light in a lantern, so constructed as to show a clear, uniform, and unbroken light all around the horizon Second. If sailing vessels, of seven tons gross tonnage and upwards, shall carry a white light in a lantern, so constructed as to show a clear, uniform, and unbroken light all around the horizon, and shall also be provided with a sufficient supply of red pyrotechnic lights, which shall each burn for at least thirty seconds, and shall be shown on the approach of or to other vessels in sufficient time to prevent collision. In the Mediterranean Sea the vessels referred to in subdivision (b) two may use a flare-up light in lieu of a pyrotechnic light. All lights mentioned in subdivision (b) one and two shall be visible at a distance of at least two miles. Third. If sailing vessels of less than seven tons gross tonnage, shall not be obliged to carry the white light mentioned in subdivision (b) two of this article, but if they do not carry such light they shall have at hand, ready for use, a lantern showing a bright white light, which shall, on the approach of or to other vessels, be exhibited where it can best be seen, in sufficient time to prevent collision; and they shall also show a red pyrotechnic light, as prescribedin subdivision (b) two, or in lieu thereof a flare-up light.

(g) In fog, mist, falling snow, or heavy ram-storms drift-net vessels attached to

their nets, and vessels when trawling, dredging, or fishing with any kind of drag-

net and vessels line-fishing with their lines out shall, if of twenty tons gross ton-

nage or upwards, respectively, at intervals of not more than one minute make a

blast; if steam-vessels with, the whistle or siren, and if sailing-vessels with the

fog-horn, each blast to be followed by ringing the bell. (h) Sailing vessels or boats fishing with nets or lines or trawls, when under way,
shall in day-time indicate their occupation to an approaching vessel by displaying

a basket or other efficient signal, where it can best be seen. The vessels referred to in this article shall not be obliged to carry the lights pre-

scribed by article four (a) and article eleven, last paragraph. Art . 10. A vessel which is being overtaken by another shall show from her stern

to such last-mentioned vessel a white light or a flare-up light.

..

The white light required to be shown by this article may be fixed and carried ma

lantern, but in such case the lantern shall be so constructed, fitted, and screened

that it shall throw an unbroken light over an arc of the horizon of twelve points of

the compass, namely, for six points from right aft on each side of the vessel, so as

to be visible at a distance of at least one mile. Such light shall be carried as nearly

as practicable on the same level as the side-lights. Art . 11. A vessel under one hundred and fifty feet in length, when at anchor,
shall carrv forward, where it can best be seen, but at a height not exceeding twenty feet above the hull, a white light in a lantern so constructed as to show a clear, uniform, and unbroken light visible all around the horizon at a distance of least one

m A vessel of one hundred and fifty feet or upwards in length, when at anchor, shall

carry in the forward part of the vessel, at a height of not less than twenty and not exceeding forty feet above the hull, one such light, and at or near the stern of the vessel, and at such a height that it shall be not less than fifteen feet lower than the

forward light, another such light.

.

The length of a vessel shall be deemed to be the length appearing in her certificate

^A^vessel aground in or near a fair-way shall carry the above light or lights and

the two red lights prescribed by article four (a).

,

Art . 12. Every vessel may, if necessary in order to attract attention, in addition

to the lights which she is by these rules required to carry, show a flare-up light or

use any detonating signal that can not be mistaken for a distress signal.

Art . 13. Nothing in these rules shall interfere with the operation of any special

rules made by the Government of any nation with respect to additional station and signal-lights Tor two or more ships of war or for vessels sailing under convoy, 01 with the exhibition of recognition signals adopted by ship-owners, which have been authorized by their respective Governments and duly registered and published.
Art . 14. A steam-vessel proceeding under sail only but having her funnel up, shall carry in day-time, forward, where it can best be seen, one black ball or shape twc

feet in diameter.

SOUND SIGNALS FOR FOG, AND SO FORTH.

Fog, etc., signals.

Art . 15. All signals prescribed by this article for vessels underway shall be given

1. By "steam-vessels" on the whistle or siren. 2. By "sailing vessels and vessels towed" on the fog-horn. The words "prolonged blast" used in this article shall mean a blast of from foui

to six seconds' duration.

.

A steam-vessel shall be provided with an efficient whistle or siren, sounded by

steam or by some substitute for steam, so placed that the sound may not be inter

cepted bv any obstruction, and with an efficient fog-horn, to be sounded by median

ical means, and also with an efficient bell. (In all cases where the rules require <1

bell to be used a drum may be substituted on board Turkish vessels, or a gong when3

such articles are used on board small sea going vessels ] . A sailing vessel of twenty

tons gross tonnage or upward shall be provided with a similar fog-horn and bell.

In fog, mist, falling snow, or heavy rainstorms, whether by day or night, the sig

nals described in this article shall be used as follows, viz:

(a) A steam-vessel having way upon her shall sound, at intervals of not moretnai1

two minutes, a prolonged blast.

Regulations to prevent collisions at sea-- Continued.

(b) A steam-vessel under way, but stopped, and having no way upon her, shall sound, at intervals of not more than two minutes, two prolonged blasts, with an interval of about one second between them.
(c) A sailing vessel under way shall sound, at intervals of not more than one minute, when on the starboard tack one blast, when on the port tack two blasts in succession, and when with the wind abaft the beam three blasts in succession
(d) A vessel when at anchor shall, at intervals of not more than one minute, ring the bell rapidly for about five seconds.
(e) A vessel at anchor at sea, when not in ordinary anchorage ground, and when in such a position as to be an obstruction to vessels under way, shall sound, if a steam-vessel, at intervals of not more than two minutes, two prolonged blasts with her whistle or siren, followed by ringing her bell; or, if a sailing-vessel, at intervals of not more than one minute, two blasts with her fog-horn, followed by ringing her bell.
(f) A vessel when towing shall, instead of the signals prescribed in subdivisions (a) and (c) of this article at intervals of not more than two minutes, sound three blasts in succession, namely, one prolonged blast followed by two short blasts. A vessel towed may give this signal and she shall not give any other.
(g) A steam-vessel wishing to indicate to another "The way is off my vessel, you may feel your way past me," may sound three blasts in succession, namely, short, long, short, with intervals of about one second between them.
(h) A vessel employed in laying or picking up a telegraph cable shall, on hearing the fog-signal of an approaching vessel, sound in answer three prolonged blasts in succession.
(i) A vessel under way, which is unable to get out of the way of an approaching vessel through being not under command, or unable to maneuver as required by these rules, shall, on hearing the fog-signal of an approaching vessel, sound in answerfour short blasts in succession.
Sailing vessels and boats of less than twenty tons gross tonnage shall not be oblige d to give the above-mentioned signals, but, if they do not, they shall make some other efficient sound-signal at intervals of not more than one minute.

Speed.

SPEED OF SHIPS TO BE MODERATE IN FOG, AND SO FORTH.

Art . 16. Every vessel shall, in a fog, mist, falling snow, or heavy rain-storms, go at a moderate speed, having careful regard to the existing circumstances and con-
ditions. A steam vessel hearing, apparently forward of her beam, the fog-signal of a vessel
the position of which is not ascertained shall, so far as the circumstances of the case admit, stop her engines, and then navigate with caution until danger of collision is over.

Steering and sailing rules.

Stee ri ng and Sai li ng Rule s .

PRELIMINARY--RISK OF COLLISION.

Risk of collision can, when circumstances permit, be ascertained by carefully watching the compass bearing of an approaching vessel. If the bearing does not appreciably change, such risk should be deemed to exist.
Art . 17. When two sailing vessels are approaching one another, so as to involve risk of collision, one of them shall keep out -of the way of the other, as follows, namely:
(a) A vessel which is running free shall keep out of the way of a vessel which is close-hauled.
(b) A vessel which is close-hauled on the port tack shall keep out of the way of a vessel which is close-hauled on the starboard tack.
(c) When both are running free, with the wind on different sides, the vessel which has the wind on the port side shall keep out of the way of the other.
(d) When both are running free, with the wind on the same side, the vessel which is to the windward shall keep out of the way of the vessel which is to leeward.
(e) A vessel which has the wind aft shall keep out of the way of the other vessel. Art . 18. When two steam-vessels are iheeting end on, or nearly end on, so as to involve risk of collision, each shall alter her course to starboard, so that each may pass on the port side of the other. This article only applies to cases where vessels are meeting end on, or nearly end on, in such a manner as to involve risk of collision, and does not apply to two vessels which must, if both keep on their respective courses, pass clear of each other. The only cases to which it does apply are when each of the two vessels is end on, or nearly end on, to the other; in other words, to cases in which, by day, each vessel sees the masts of the other in a line, or nearly in a line, with her own; and by night, to cases in which each vessel is in such a position as to see both the side-lights of the other.
It does not apply by day to cases in which a vessel sees another ahead crossing her own course; or by night, to cases where the red light of one vessel is opposed to the red light of the other, or where the green light of one vessel is opposed to the green light of the other, or where a red light without a green light, ora green light without a red light, is seen ahead, or where both green and red lights are seen anywhere but ahead.

Art . 20. When a steam-vessel and a sailing vessel are proceeding in such direc-

tions as to involve risk of collision, the steam-vessel shall keep out of the way of the

sailing-vessel.

Art . 21. Where by any of these rules one of two vessels is to keep out of the way,

the other shall keep her course and speed.

Art . 22. Every vessel which is directed by these rules to keep out of the way of

another vessel shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, avoid crossing ahead of

the other.

Art . 23. Every steam-vessel which is directed by these rules to keep out of the

way of another vessel shall, on approaching her, if necessary, slacken her speed or

stop or reverse.

Art . 24. Notwithstanding anything contained in these rules every vessel, over-

taking any other, shall keep out of the way of the overtaken vessel.

Every vessel coming up with another vessel from any direction more than two

points abaft her beam, that is, in such a position, with reference to the vessel which

she is overtaking that at night she would be unable to see either of that vessel's

side-lights, shall be deemed to be an overtaking vessel; and no subsequent altera-

tion of the bearing between the two vessels shall make the overtaking vessel a

crossing vessel within the meaning of these rules, or relieve her of the duty of keep-

ing clear of the overtaken vessel until she is finally past and clear.

As by day the overtaking vessel can not always know with certainty whether she

is forward of or abaft this direction from the other vessel she should, if in doubt,

assume that she is an overtaking vessel and keep out of the way.

Art . 25. In narrow channels every steam-vessel shall, when it is safe and prac-

ticable, keep to that side of the fair-way or mid-channel which lies on the star- i

board side of such vessel. Art . 26. Sailing vessels under way shall keep out of the way of sailing vessels or
boats fishing with nets, or lines, or trawls. This rule shall not give to any vessel or boat engaged in fishing the right of obstructing a fair-way used by vessels other than fishing vessels or boats.
Art . 27. In obeying and construing these rules due regard shall be had to all dangers of navigation and collision, and to any special circumstances which may render a departure from the above rules necessary in order to avoid immediate

danger.

SOUND-SIGNALS FOR VESSELS IN SIGHT OF ONE ANOTHER.

Sound signals.

Art . 28. The words " short blast " used in this article shall mean a blast of about one second's duration.
When vessels are in sight of one another, a steam-vessel under way, in taking any course authorized or required by these rules, shall indicate that course by the following signals on her whistle or siren, namely:
One short blast to mean, "I am directing my course to starboard." Two short blasts to mean, "I am directing my course to port." Three short blasts to mean, "My engines are going at full speed astern."

NO VESSEL, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, TO NEGLECT PROPER PRECAUTIONS.

Art . 29. Nothing in these rules shall exonerate any vessel or the owner or master

or crew thereof, from the consequences of any neglect to carry lights or signals, or

of any neglect to keep a proper look-out, or of the neglect of any precaution which

may be required by the ordinary practice of seamen, or by the special circumstances

of the case.



RESERVATION OF RULES FOR HARBORS AND INLAND NAVIGATION.

Art . 30. Nothing in these rules shall interfere with the operation of a special rule, duly made by local authority, relative to the navigation of any harbor, river, or inland waters.
DISTRESS SIGNALS.

Distress signals.

Art . 31. When a vessel is in distress and requires assistance from other vessels or from the shore, the following shall be the signals to be used or displayed by her, either together or separately, namely:
In the day time-- First. A gun fired at intervals of about a minute; Second. The International Code signal of distress indicated by N C; Third. The distance signal, consisting of a square flag, having either above or below it a ball or anything resembling a ball; Fourth. Rockets or shells as prescribed below for use at night; Fifth. A continuous sounding with any fog-signal apparatus. At night-- One. A gun fired at intervals of about a minute; Two. Flames on the vessel (as from a burning tar-barrel, oil-barrel, and so forth);

Three. Rockets or shells, bursting in the air with a loud report and throwing stars of any color or description, fired one at a time at short intervals;
Four. A continuous sounding with any fog-signal apparatus. Sec . 2. That all laws or parts of laws inconsistent with the foregoing regulations for preventing collisions at sea for the navigation of all public and private vessels of the United States upon the high seas, and in all waters connected therewith navigable by sea-going vessels, are hereby repealed. Sec . 3. That this act shall take effect at a time to be fixed by the President by proclamation issued for that purpose.

Ante, p. 82.

And, whereas, an Act of Congress entitled "An Act To amend an Act approved August nineteenth, eighteen hundred and ninety, entitled `An Act to adopt regulations for preventing collissions at sea,'''was approved May 28, 1894, the said Act being in the following words:

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America

in Congress assembled, That article seven of the Act approved August nineteenth,

eighteen hundred and ninety, entitled "An Act to adopt regulations for preventing

collisions at sea," be amended to read as follows:

than twenty tons gross tonnage, respectively, and rowing boats, when under way,

shall not be required to carry the lights mentioned in article two (a), (b), and (c),

but if they do not carry them they shall be provided with the following lights:

" First. Steam vessels of less than forty tons shall carry--

"(a) In the fore part of the vessel, or on or in front of the funnel, where it can

best be seen, and at a height above the gunwale of not Jess than nine feet, a bright

character as to be visible at a distance of at least two miles.

"(b) Green and red side-lights constructed and fixed as prescribed in article two

(b) and (c), and of such a character as to be visible at a distance of at least one mile,

or a combined lantern showing a green light and a red light from right ahead to two

points abaft the beam on their respective sides. Such lanterns shall be carried not

less than three feet below the white light.

" Second. Small steamboats, such as are carried by seagoing vessels, may carry the

white light at a less height than nine feet above the gunwale, but it shall be carried

above the combined lantern mentioned in subdivision one (b).

"Third. Vessels under oars or sails of less than twenty tons shall have ready at

hand a lantern with a green glass on one side and a red glass on the other, which, on

the approach of or to other vessels, shall be exhibited in sufficient time to prevent

collision, so that the green light shall not be seen on the port side nor the red light

on the starboard side.

"Fourth. Rowing boats, whether under oars or sail, shall have ready at hand a lantern showing a white light which shall be temporarily exhibited in sufficient time to prevent collision.

Ante, p. 281.

"The vessels referred to in this article shall not be obliged to carry the lights prescribed by article four (a) and article eleven, last paragraph."
That article nine be hereby repealed. That article twenty-one be amended to read as follows: "Article twenty-one. Where, by any of these rules, one of two vessels is to keep out of the way the other shall keep her course and speed.

"Not e .--When, in consequence of thick weather or other causes, such vessel finds

herself so close that collision can not be avoided by the action of the giving-way

vessel alone, she also shall take such action as will best aid to avert collision." (See

articles twenty-seven and twenty-nine.)



That article thirty-one be amended to read as follows:

Distress signals.

A PROCLAMATION.

Whereas Congress by a statute approved March 22d 1882, and by statutes in furtherance and amendment thereof, defined the crimes of. PVroela.m22b,lep.. 30. bigamy, polygamy and unlawful cohabitation in the Territories and other places within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States, and

prescribed a penalty for such crimes; and Whereas, on or about the sixth day of October, 1890, the Church of
the Latter Day Saints, commonly known as the Mormon Church, through its President, issued a manifesto proclaiming the purpose of said Church no longer to sanction the practice of polygamous marriages and calling upon all members and adherents of said Church to obey the laws of the United States in reference to said subject matter; and
Whereas on the fourth day of January, A. D. 1893, Benjamin Harri-

son, then President of the United States, did declare and grant a full Vol. 27, p. 1058. pardon and amnesty to certain offenders under said acts upon condition

of future obedience to their requirements as is fully set forth in said proclamation of amnesty and pardon; and
Whereas upon the evidence now furnished me I am satisfied that the members and adherents of said Church generally abstain from plural marriages and polygamous cohabitation and are now living in obedience to the laws, and that the time has now arrived when the interests of public justice and morality will be promoted by the granting of amnesty

and pardon to all such offenders as have complied with the conditions, of said proclamation, including such of said offenders as have been convicted under the provisions of said act,
Now Therefore, I, Grover Cleveland, President of the United States, Pardon and amnes+y

by virtue of the powers in me vested, do hereby declare and grant a ting polygamy, etc. full amnesty and pardon to all persons who have in violation of said acts committed either of the offences of polygamy, bigamy, adultery or unlawful cohabitation under the color of polygamous or plural marriage,

or who, having been convicted of violations of said acts, are now suffering deprivation of civil rights in consequence of the same, excepting all persons who have not complied with the conditions contained in said executive proclamation of January the fourth, 1893.
