CHAP. XIV.-An Act providing for Salvage in cases of Recapture. (a)

SECTION 1. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That when any

(a) Salvage on recapture. Salvage is a compensation for actual services rendered in saving the property charged with it ; and it is demandable of right for vessels saved fromthe enemy, or from pirates. There must be meritorious services, and the taking must be lawful. Talbot v. Seaman, 1 Cranch, 1 ; 1 Cond. Rep. 229.
On the recapture of a vessel by a neutral vessel, no claim for salvage can arise, for the recapture was a hostile act, not justified by the situation of the nation to which the recapturing vessel belongs, in relation to that from the possession of which the recaptured vessel was taken. The degree of service rendered in such a case, is precisely the same as if it had been rendered by a belligerent ; yet the rights accruing from the recapture are different, because no right can accrue from an act which was unlawful. Ibid.
American property recaptured was restored on payment of salvage ; the libel having prayed the condemnation as prize, and no salvage having been claimed. The question of salvage is incident to the question of prize. The Adeline, 9 Cranch, 244 ; 3 Cond . Rep. 397.
In order to entitle to salvage, as upon a recapture or rescue, the property must have been in possession of the enemy, either actual or constructive. The Ann Green, 1 Gallis . C. C. R. 274.
Salvage is not due for " rescuing a vessel of a neutral out of the hands of a belligerent , who has

April 4, 1800.
Repealed by Act of Dec. 19, 1803, ch. 6 .

(a) Decisions on the Bankrupt Law of the United States . - The holder of a promissory note, drawn before, but transferred after a commission of bankruptcy had issued against the drawer, is entitled to prove his debt under the commission , and to receive a dividend. Humphreys v. Blight's Assignees, 4 Dall. 370.
In the case of negotiable paper, the assignee takes it, discharged of all the equity as between the original parties, of which he had no notice. But wherever the assignee has notice of such equity, either
positively or constructively, he takes the assignment at his peril. A commission of bankruptcy is legal notice that wherever mutual debts subsisted between the bankrupt and his creditors , the right of set-off attaches. When the negotiable paper was assigned after the commission of bankruptcy, the party takes it, subject to any set-off as between the drawer and payee. Ibid.
Under the bankrupt law of the United States, a joint debt may be set- off against the separate claim of the assignee of one of the partners ; but such set- off could not have been made at law, independent of the bankrupt law. Tucker v. Oxley, 5 Cranch, 34 ; 2 Cond. Rep. 182.
A joint debt may be proved under a separate commission, and a full dividend received ; it is equity alone which can restrain the joint creditor from receiving his full dividend until the joint effects are exhausted . Ibid.
Wherever the terms in which a power is granted bythe constitution to Congress , or wherever the nature
of the power itself, requires that it shall be exclusively exercised by Congress, the subject is completely taken away from state legislatures, as if they had been forbidden to act upon it. The power granted to Congress of establishing uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcy, is not of this description. Sturges v. Crowninshield, 4 Wheat. 122 ; 4 Cond. Rep. 409.
In the distribution of a bankrupt's effects in this country, the United States are entitled to a preference, although the debt was contracted by a foreigner in a foreign country ; and although the United States had proved their debt under the commission of bankruptcy, and had voted for an assignee. Harrison v. Sterry et al., 5 Cranch, 289 ; 2 Cond. Rep. 260.
A conveyance on the eve of bankruptcy , to give a preference to a particular class of creditors, is a fraud on the bankrupt law and void. Ibid.
Such assignment may be valid to secure money actually advanced on the credit of it, and subsequent to its date. Ibid.
Under a separate commission of bankruptcy, against one partner only, his private property, and his interest in the funds of the company passes. Ibid.
The right to compensation from Spain, held under an abandonment made to underwriters, and accepted by them, for damages and injuries, which were to be satisfied under the treaty, by the United States ; passed to the assignees of the bankrupt, who held such rights by the provisions of the bankrupt law of the United States, passed April 4, 1800. Comegys et al. v. Vasse, 1 Peters, 193.
The circuit courts of the United States have jurisdiction of matters arising under the bankrupt law of the United States, as they have of any other subject, where the constitution and laws of the United States give jurisdiction ; but the district courts have not the same jurisdiction in cases of bankruptcy, as the chancellor of England has. Lucas et al. v. Morris et al. , 1 Paine's C. C. R. 396.
The district courts of the United States have not, like the chancellor in England, exclusive jurisdiction over the entire execution of the bankrupt law. They cannot remove assignees, nor compel them to account. lbid.
Upon the death of an assignee under the bankrupt law of the United States, the right of action for a debt due to the bankrupt, vested in the executor of the assignee. Richards et al . Assignees, &c. v. Ma. ryland Ins. Co., 8 Cranch, 84 ; 3 Cond. Rep. 45.
Where the original ground of action is founded on contract, but the immediate cause arises ex delicto, and the claim is for damages, unliquidated by any express agreement, or such as the law will not imply an agreement to pay ; the certificate of bankruptcy is no bar ; because such claim could not have been proved under the commission . Dusar v. Murgatroyd, 1 Wash. C. C. R. 13.

But if the agreement were to pay a particular sum, on failure to perform the contract ; or if the case was such that the plaintiff has his election to bring either trespass or case for money had and received, and waives the former by bringing the latter ; the damages become a debt, which the law implies a promise to pay, and the certificate is a bar. Ibid.
In an action brought against the owner of a vessel for damages for an injury sustained on board a ship by the neglect of the master, a certificate of bankruptcy cannot be pleaded in bar. Ibid.
One guilty of perjury in proceedings under the bankrupt law, cannot be prosecuted for the offence , after the repeal of the law. United States v. Passmore , 4 Dall. 372.
A deed executed before the 1st of June , 1800 , although acknowledged after, is not within the 1st section of the bankrupt act of April 4th, 1800, chap. 19. Wood v. Owings, 1 Cranch, 239 ; 1 Cond. Rep. 302.
A certificated bankrupt or insolvent, discharged from the particular contract, need not be made a party to the bill on the contract. Van Reimsdyke v. Kane Ex'r, 1 Gall. C. C. R. 371 .
The power given to Congress to pass uniform laws, relative to bankruptcy, is exclusive of such power in the state governments ; and this, whether the former has thought proper to exercise it or not. Golden v. Prince, 3 Wash. C. C. R. 313.
A discharge from a debt under the bankrupt laws of the place of contract, is good in every other place where pleaded , as an extinguishment of the debt. But a like discharge where the contract is not made, has no effect. Le Roy v. Crowninshield, 2 Mason's C. C. R. 151.
A debtor concealing himself from, and being denied to his creditors, does not constitute an act of bankruptcy under the laws of the United States ; unless the service of process is thereby prevented. Barnes et al. v. Billington, 1 Wash. C. C. R. 29.
If the debtor order himself to be denied to creditors and others, and is in consequence thereof denied
to an officer, who comes to serve a process, it is an act of bankruptcy ; provided the officer comes to serve the process, and not on other business : and the denial has taken place within six months of the issuing of the commission. Ibid.
Giving a bond, with warrant to confess judgment to one creditor, upon the eve and in contemplation of bankruptcy, does not constitute a bankruptcy ; unless the judgment entered on the bond, and the issuing of the execution was at the instance or by the procurement of the debtor. Such a bond would be a fraud on the general creditors. Ibid.
Where two of three assignees of a bankrupt enter into an agreement in the absence of the third, the contract is not binding on the absent assignee ; unless he had previously given authority to make it , or substantially recognize and acknowledge it. Aliter, among partners. Blight v. Ashley et al. , 1 Peters' C. C. R. 16.
The agreement of the assignees of a bankrupt, to give a preference to a particular creditor, is not valid, without the assent of the commissioners , and a certain portion of the creditors. Ibid.
Denial to an officer, whereby he is prevented serving process, must be really adversary, and not by concert between the creditor and the debtor, to bring about an act of bankruptcy. Ibid.
No debt but such as is due and owing at the time of the bankruptcy, can be proved under the commission ; and, consequently, an endorser or acceptor of a bill of exchange, drawn by the bankrupt , who has not paid it before the bankruptcy, cannot prove the debt. Marks et al. Assignees v. Barker et al. , 1 Wash. C. C. R. 178.
The acceptor or endorser of a bill of exchange, who pays the bill after the bankruptcy of the drawer, may offset the same against the bankrupt's assignees ; but he must show the debt to be a subsisting one in him, at the time the action was brought, for this is a case of mutual credit, given before the bankruptcy, although the money was not paid until after. Ibid.
The district courts of the United States have not power, in bankrupt cases, to remove assignees, or compel them to account. Lucas v. Morris, Paine's C. C. R. 396.
The holder of the negotiable paper, payable " without defalcation ," under the laws of Pennsylvania, assigned after a commission of bankruptcy has issued , may come in under the commission ; allowing all
just offsets existing at the time of the bankruptcy, and which would have been admitted if the assignment had not been made. Humphreys v. Blight's Assignees, 1 Wash . C. C. R. 44.
The purchaser of a negotiable note , who becomes so after a commission of bankruptcy has issued, may prove under the commission ; and he holds the note, subject to all legal offsets. Ibid.
The 65th section of the bankrupt law of the United States , passed the 2d of March, 1799 , does not repeal the provisions of the laws of the United States, which give to the surety who pays bonds for duties, a preference over other creditors. Mott v. The Assignees of Maris , 2 Wash. C. C. R. 196.
The provisions of the bankrupt law except from its general operation , not only the preference of the United States, but also the right of preference for satisfaction of debts dueto the United States. Ibid.
P. paid a sum of money to the United States, as surety of S., in a bond for duties. S. became insolvent, and assigned his effects to Baker, who received four thousand dollars under the assignment, mixed the same with his own funds, and afterwards became bankrupt, and the defendants were appointed his assignees ; but no effects, known to be part of the estate of S. , came into their hands. The plaintiff
claimed to have a preference and priority over the general creditors of Baker. By the Court- Although the United States might, under the 65th section of the law to regulate the collection of duties, be entitled to claim of the defendants to the amount which came into the hands of B. , as the assignees of S. , the provisions of the law do not extend to the surety who has paid the bond, the same rights and privileges. Pollock v. Pratt & Harvey, 2 Wash. C. C. R. 490.
A. H. devised an estate to C. S. , for life ; and after the death of C. S. , he directed that the estate should be sold, and divided among the grandchildren of the testator, who should be living at the death of C. S. B. married one of the grandchildren , and, before the death of C. S., B. became bankrupt. B. and wife, after the decease of C. S. , sold the property claimed under the will of A.

amounting to one thousand dollars or upwards, shall not, upon notice of

such attachment, give sufficient security for the payment of what may be recovered in the suit in which he or she shall be arrested, at or

before the return day of the same, to be approved by the judge of the

district, or some judge of the court out of which the process issued

that no person shall be liable to a commission of bankruptcy, if the petition be not preferred, in manner herein after directed, within six months

thousand dollars, shall have power, by commission under his hand and seal, to appoint such good and substantial persons, being citizens of the United States, and resident in such district, as such judge shall deem proper, not exceeding three, to be commissioners of the said bankrupt, and in case of vacancy or refusal to act , to appoint others from time to

time, as occasion may require :(a) Provided always , that before any

under this conveyance. By the Court- The decisions of the English courts, abundantly prove that a

possibility, whether belonging to the husband or the wife, would not pass to the assignees of the husband, on his becoming bankrupt, if it were not for the strong language of the statutes of bankruptcy. Krumbaar v. Burt, 2 Wash. C. C. R. 406.

The possibility held by B., under the will of A. H., formed no part of his estate to which he was entitled in law or equity, of which the commissioners could take possession under the 5th section of the bankrupt law of the United States ; and, therefore, they could not transfer it to the assignees of the bank-

rupt, under the provisions of the 6th section. Ibid.

The provisions of the English bankrupt laws, and those of the bankrupt law of the United States, differ

in relation to the contingent interests of the bankrupt ; and it is clear, that by the most liberal construc-

tion of the law, the interest of the husband in the estate of his wife, under the will of A. H. , did not

pass to the assignees . Ibid.



The provisions of the 13th section of the bankrupt law of the United States, do not affect this question ;

they do not require an assignment of contingent interests , but relate to their disclosure by the bankrupt. Ibid.

So exclusively have bankrupt laws operated on traders, that it may well be doubted, whether an act of

Congress, subjecting to such a law every description of persons within the United States, would comport

with the spirit of the powers vested in them in relation thereto. Per Livingston , J. in Adams v. Storey, Paine's C. C. R. 79.

(a) By the 14th section of the act of April 29, 1802, entitled , " An act to amend the judicial system of

The decisions of the courts of the United States upon this and other statutes relating to the District of Columbia , and other questions arising in the district, have been : The act of Congress of 27 February, 1801 , concerning the District of Columbia, directs that writs of error shall be prosecuted in the same manner, under the same regulations , and the same proceedings shall be had thereon , as is or shall be provided in case of writs of error on judgments, or appeals upon
orders or decrees, rendered in the circuit courts of the United States. United States v. Hooe et al., 1 Cranch, 318 ; 1 Cond. Rep. 322.
By the separation of the District of Columbia from the state of Maryland, the residents in that part of Maryland which became a part of the district ceased to be citizens of the state. Reilly, Appellant v. Lamar et al. , 2 Cranch, 344 ; 1 Cond. Rep. 419.
A citizen of the District of Columbia, could not be discharged by the insolvent law of Maryland , out of the district. Ibid.
A citizen of the District of Columbia, cannot maintain an action in the circuit court of the United States, out of the district ; he not being a citizen of a state within the meaning of the provision in the law of the United States, regulating the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States. Hepburn and Dundas v. Ellzey, 2 Cranch, 445 ; 1 Cond. Rep. 444.
A justice of the peace, in the District of Columbia, is an officer of the government of the United States ; and is exempt from militia duty. Wise v. Withers, 3 Cranch, 331 ; 1 Cond. Rep. 552 .
Under the sixth and eighth sections of the act of assembly of Virginia, of the 22d of December, 1794, property pledged to the Mutual Assurance Society, &c. continues liable for assessments, on account of the losses insured against, in the hands of a bona fide purchaser, without notice . The Mutual Assurance Society v. Watts' Ex'r, 1 Wheat. 279 ; 3 Cond. Rep. 570.
A mere change of sovereignty produces no change in the state of rights existing in the soil ; and the cession ofthe District of Columbia to the national government did not affect the lien created by the above
act on real property situate in the town of Alexandria ; though the personal character or liability of a member of the society could not be thereby forced on a purchaser of such property. Ibid.
Congress has authority to impose a direct tax on the District of Columbia, in proportion to the census directed to be taken by the constitution . Loughborough v. Blake, 5 Wheat. 317 ; 4 Cond. Rep. 660.
Congress, when legislating for the District of Columbia, under the fifth section of the first article ofthe constitution, is still the legislature of the Union , and its acts are the laws of the United States. Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264 ; 5 Cond . Rep. 90.
An act of the legislature of Maryland, passed the 19th of December, 1791 , entitled " An act concerning the territory of Columbia, and the city of Washington, " which, by the 6th section, provides for the holding of lands by " foreigners," is an enabling act ; and applies to those only who could not take lands without the provisions of that law. It enables a " foreigner" to take in the same manner as if he were a citizen. Spratt v. Spratt, 1 Peters , 343.
A foreigner who becomes a citizen, is no longer a foreigner, within the view of the act. Thus , after purchase, lands vested in him as a citizen ; not by virtue of the act of the legislature of Maryland, but because of his acquiring the rights of citizenship. Ibid.
Land in the county of Washington, and District of Columbia, purchased by a foreigner, before naturalization, was held by him under the law of Maryland , and might be transmitted to the relations of the purchasers, who were foreigners : and the capacity so to transmit those lands, is given , absolutely, by this act, and is not affected by his becoming a citizen ; but passes to his heirs and relations, precisely as if he had remained a foreigner. Ibid.
The supreme court of the United States has jurisdiction of appeals from the orphans' court, through the circuit court for the county of Washington, by virtue of the act of Congress of February 13, 1801 ; and by the act of Congress subsequently passed , the matter in dispute, exclusive of costs, must exceed the value of one thousand dollars, in order to entitle the party to an appeal. Nicholls et al. v. Hodges' Ex'rs, 1 Peters , 565.
The statute of Elizabeth is in force in the District of Columbia. Cathcart et al. v. Robinson, 5 Peters, 264.
The levy court of Washington county is not entitled to one half of all the fines, penalties, and forfeitures imposed by the circuit court in cases at common law, and under the acts of Congress, as well as
the acts of assembly of Maryland, adopted by Congress as the law of the District of Columbia. Levy Court of Washington v. Ringgold, 5 Peters, 451 .
The supreme court of the United States has no jurisdiction of causes brought before it, upon a certifi. cate of division of opinion of the judges of the circuit court for the District of Columbia. The appellate jurisdiction, in respect to that court, extends only to its final judgments and decrees. Ross v. Triplett.
Wheat. 600 ; 4 Cond. Rep. 351. Bythe insolvent law of Maryland , of January 3, 1800, the chancellor of Maryland could not discharge one who was an inhabitant of the District of Columbia, after the separation from Maryland, unless previous

as they now exist, shall be and continue in force in that part of the said district, which was ceded by that state to the United States, and by them accepted as aforesaid.
SEC. 2. And be it further enacted, That the said district of Columbia
shall be formed into two counties ; one county shall contain all that part of said district, which lies on the east side of the river Potomac, together with the islands therein, and shall be called the county of Washington ; the other county shall contain all that part of said district, which lies on the west side of said river, and shall be called the county of Alexandria ; and the said river in its whole course through said district shall be taken and deemed to all intents and purposes to be within both of said counties.

Said court shall consist of one chief judge and two assistant judges resident within said district, to hold their respective offices during good behaviour ; any two of whom shall constitute a quorum ; and each of the said judges shall, before he enter on his

to that separation he had entitled himself to a discharge by performing all the requisites of the act. Reilly v. Lamar et al . 2 Cranch, 344 ; 1 Cond . Rep . 419.
No appeal or writ of error lies, in a criminal case, from the judgment of the circuit court of the District of Columbia, to the supreme court of the United States : the appellate jurisdiction given by the act of Congress, is confined to civil cases. United States v. More, 3 Cranch, 159 ; 1 Cond. Rep. 480.
There is, in the District of Columbia, no division of powers between the general and the state governments. Congress has the entire control over the district, for every purpose of government : and it is reasonable to suppose that, in organizing a judicial department in the district, all the judicial power, necessary for the purpose of government, would be vested in the courts of justice. Kendall, Postmaster General v . The United States, 12 Peters, 524.
The circuit court of the United States, for the District of Columbia, has a right to award a mandamus to the postmaster- general of the United States, requiring him to pass to the credit of certain contractors
for conveying the mail ofthe United States, a sum found to be due to them bythe solicitor ofthe treasury of the United States, the solicitor acting under the special provisions of an act of Congress. Ibid.
There can be no doubt, that, in the state of Maryland, a writ of mandamus might be issued to an executive officer, commanding him to perform a ministerial act, required of him by the laws : and if it would lie in that state, there can be no good reason why it should not lie in the District of Columbia, in analogous cases. Ibid.
The powers of the supreme court of the United States, and of the circuit courts of the United States, to issue writs of mandamus, granted by the fourteenth section of the judiciary act of 1789, is only for the purpose of bringing the case to a final judgment or decree, so that it may be reviewed. The mandamus does not direct the inferior court how to proceed , but only that it must proceed, according to its own judgment, to a final determination ; otherwise it cannot be reviewed in the appellate court. It is different
in the circuit court of the District of Columbia, under the adoption of the laws of Maryland, which included the common law. Ibid.
The power of the circuit court of the District of Columbia, to exercise the jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus to a public officer, to do an act required of him by law, results from the third section of the act of Congress of February 27, 1804 ; which declares that the court and judges thereof shall have all the powers by law vested in the circuit courts of the United States. The circuit courts referred to,
were those established by the act of February 13 , 1801. The repeal of that law, fifteen months afterwards, and after that law had gone into operation , under the act of February 27, 1801 , could not in any manner affect that law, any further than was provided by the repealing act. Ibid.
The circuit courts of the United States, sitting in the states of the Union, have no jurisdiction in a case in which a citizen of the District of Columbia is plaintiff. Westcott's Lessee v. Inhabitants , &c. Peters' C. C. R. 45.
The act of Congress of June , 1822, authorizes any person to whom administration has been granted in the states of the United States, to prosecute claims by suits in the District of Columbia, in the same manner as if the same had been granted by proper authority, in the District of Columbia, to such persons. The power is limited by its terms to the institution of suits, and does not authorize suits against an executor or administrator. The effect of this law was to make all debts due by persons in the District of Columbia, not local assets, for which the administrator was bound to account in the courts of the district, but general assets which he had full authority to receive, and for which he was bound to account in the courts of the state from which he derived his letters of administration. Vaughan et al . v. Northup et al., 15 Peters' Rep. 1.
The courts of the United States in the District of Columbia, have a like jurisdiction upon personal property, with the courts in England, and in the states of the Union ; and in the absence of statutory provisions, in the trial of them they must apply the same common law principle which regulates the mode of bringing such actions, the pleadings and the proof.

APPROVED , March 30, 1802.

(a) The decisions of the courts of the United States, on the subject of the Indians , have been : It was doubted whether a state can be seised in fee of lands subject to the Indian title, and whether a decision that they were seised in fee , might not be construed to amount to a decision that their grantee might maintain an ejectment for them, notwithstanding that title. The majority of the court is of opinion that the nature of the Indian title, which is certainly to be respected by all courts until it be legitimately extinguished, is not such as to be absolutely repugnant to a seisin in fee on the part of the state. Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch, 87 ; 2 Cond. Rep. 308. The acts of assembly of North Carolina, passed between the years 1783 and 1789, avoid all entries, surveys, and grants of land set apart for the Cherokee Indians, and no title can be acquired to those lands. Danforth's Lessee v. Thomas , 1 Wheat. 155 ; 3 Cond. Rep. 524. The boundaries of the reservation made by the laws of North Carolina, have been altered by treaties
with the Indians ; but it seems that the mere extinguishment of their title does not subject the land to entry, unless expressly authorized by the legislature. Ibid.
The condition of the Indians, in relation to the United States, is perhaps unlike that of any other two people in existence. In general , nations not owing a common allegiance, are foreign to each other. The term foreign nation , is with strict propriety applicable by either to the other. But the relation ofthe
Indians to the United States, is marked by peculiar and cardinal distinctions, which exist no where else. The Cherokee Nation v. The State of Georgia , 5 Peters , 1 .
The Indians are acknowledged to have an unquestionable, and heretofore an unquestioned right to the lands they occupy, until that right shall be extinguished by a voluntary cession to the government. It may well be doubted , whether those tribes which reside within the acknowledged boundaries of the United States, can with strict accuracy be denominated foreign nations. They may more correctly , perhaps, be denominated domestic dependent nations. They occupy a territory to which we assert a title, independent of their will, which must take effect in point of possession , when their right of possession ceases ; meanwhile they are in a state of pupilage. Their relations to the United States resemble that of a ward to his guardian. They look to our government for protection ; rely upon its kindness and its power ; appeal to it for relief to their wants ; and address the President as their great father. Ibid.
The treaties and laws of the United States, contemplate the Indian territory as completely separated from that of the states ; and provide that all intercourse with them shall be carried on exclusively by the government of the Union. Worcester v. The State of Georgia, 6 Peters , 515.
The Indian nations had always been considered as distinct, independent political communities, retaining their original natural rights, as the undisputed possessors of the soil, from time immemorial ; with the single exception of that imposed by irresistible power, which excluded them from intercourse with any other European potentate, than the first discoverer of the coast of the particular region claimed and this was a restriction which those European potentates imposed on themselves, as well as on the Indians. The very term " nation," so generally applied to them, means " a people distinct from others." The constitution , by declaring treaties already made, as well as those to be made , to be the supreme law of the land, has adopted and sanctioned the previous treaties with the Indian nations, and , consequently, admits their rank among those powers who are capable of making treaties . The words " treaty" and " nation" are words of our own language , selected in our diplomatic and legislative proceedings, by ourselves ; having each a definite and well understood meaning. We have applied them to Indians, as we have applied them to other nations of the earth. They are applied to all in the same sense. Ibid.
One uniform rule seems to have prevailed in the British provinces in America, by which Indian lands were held and sold, from their first settlement, as appears by their laws ; that friendly Indians were pro. tected in the possession of the lands they occupied , and were considered as owning them by a perpetual right of possession in the tribe or nation inhabiting them, as their common property, from generation to generation, not as the right of the individuals located on particular spots. Subject to this right of pos session, the ultimate fee was in the crown , and its grantees ; which could be granted by the crown or colonial legislatures , while the lands remained in possession ofthe Indians ; though possession could not be taken without their consent. Mitchell v. United States, 9 Peters, 711.
Individuals could not purchase Indian lands without permission or license from the crown , colonial governors, or according to the rules prescribed by colonial laws ; but such purchases were valid with such license , or in conformity with the local laws and by this union of the perpetual right of occupancy with the ultimate fee, which passed from the crown by the license , the title of the purchaser became complete . Ibid.
Indian possession or occupation was considered with reference to their habits and modes of life ; their hunting grounds were as much in their actual possession , as the cleared fields of the whites ; and their rights to its exclusive enjoyment in their own way, and for their own purposes, were as much respected, until they abandoned them, made a cession to the government, or an authorized sale to individuals.

either case their rights became extinct, the lands could be granted disencumbered of the right of occupancy, or enjoyed in full dominion by the purchasers from the Indians. Such was the tenure of Indian lands by the laws of Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island , New Hampshire, New York, New Jersey , Pennsylvania, Maryland , Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia. Ibid.
Grants made by the Indians at public councils, since the treaty at Fort Stanwick's, have been made directly to the purchasers , or to the state in which the land lies , in trust for them , or with directions to convey to them ; of which there are many instances of large tracts so sold and held ; especially in New York. Ibid.
It was an universal rule, that purchases made at Indian treaties, in the presence, and with the approbation of the officer under whose direction they were held by the authority of the crown, gave a valid title to the lands ; it prevailed under the laws of the states after the revolution, and yet continues in those where the right to the ultimate fee is owned by the states, or their grantees. It has been adopted
by the United States, and purchases made at treaties held by their authority, have been always held good by the ratification of the treaty, without any patent to the purchasers from the United States. This rule in the colonies was founded on a settled rule of the law of England , that by his prerogative, the king was the universal occupant of all vacant lands in his dominions, and had the right to grant them at his pleasure, or by his authorized officers. Ibid.
When the United States acquired and took possession of the Floridas, the treaties which had been made with the Indian tribes , before the acquisition of the territory by Spain and Great Britain , remained in force over all the ceded territory, as the laws which regulated the relations with all the Indians who were parties to them, and were binding on the United States, by the obligation they had assumed by the Louisiana treaty, as a supreme law of the land, which was inviolable by the power of Congress . They were also binding as the fundamental law of Indian rights ; acknowledged by royal orders, and municipal regulations of the province, as the laws and ordinances of Spain in the ceded provinces, which were declared to continue in force by the proclamation of the governor in taking possession of the provinces ; and by the acts of Congress, which assured all the inhabitants of protection in their property. It would be an unwarranted construction of these treaties, laws, ordinances and municipal regulations, to decide that the Indians were not to be maintained in the enjoyment of all the rights which they could have enjoyed under either, had the provinces remained under the dominion of Spain. It would be rather a perversion of their spirit, meaning and terms, contrary to the injunction of the law under which the court acts, which makes the stipulations of any treaty, the laws and ordinances of Spain, and these acts of Congress, so far as either apply to this case, the standard rules for its decision. Ibid.
The treaties with Spain and England, before the acquisition of Florida by the United States, which guarantied to the Seminole Indians their lands according to the right of property with which they possessed them, were adopted by the United States ; who thus became the protectors of all the rights they had previously enjoyed, or could of right enjoy under Great Britain or Spain, as individuals or nations, by any treaty, to which the United States thus became parties in 1803. Ibid.
The Indian right to the lands as property, was not merely of possession, that of alienation was concomitant ; both were equally secured , protected and guarantied by Great Britain and Spain, subject only to ratification and confirmation by the license, charter or deed from the governor representing the king. Such purchases enabled the Indians to pay their debts, compensate for their depredations on the traders resident among them to provide for their wants ; while they were available to the purchasers as payment of the considerations which at their expense had been received by the Indians. It would have been a violation of the faith of the government to both, to encourage traders to settle in the province , to put themselves and property in the power of the Indians , to suffer the latter to contract debts, and when willing to pay them by the only means in their power, a cession of their lands, withhold an assent to the purchase, which by their laws or municipal regulations, was necessary to vest a title. Such a course was never adopted by Great Britain , in any of her colonies, nor by Spain in Louisiana or Florida. Ibid.
The laws made it necessary, when the Indians sold their lands, to have the deeds presented to the
governor for confirmation . The sales by the Indians transferred the kind of right which they possessed ; the ratification of the sale by the governor, must be regarded as a relinquishment of the title of the crown to the purchaser ; and no instance is known where permission to sell has been " refused, or the rejection of an Indian sale." Ibid.
The colonial charters, a great portion of the individual grants by the proprietary and royal governments, and a still greater portion by the states of the Union after the revolution , were made for lands within the Indian hunting grounds, North Carolina and Virginia to a great extent paid their officers and soldiers of the revolutionary war by such grants, and extinguished the arrears due the army by similar means. It was one of the great resources which sustained the war, not only by those states, but by other states. The ultimate fee, encumbered with the right of Indian occupancy, was in the crown previous to the revolution, and in the states of the Union afterwards, and subject to grant. This right of occupancy was protected by the political power, and respected by the courts, until extinguished, when the patentee took the unencumbered fee. So the supreme court and the state courts have uniformly held. Clark v. Smith, 13 Peters, 195.

(a) The acts of Congress which regulate the original jurisdiction of the circuit courts, are : An act to establish the judicial courts of the United States, September 24, 1789, chap. 20 ; an act in addition to an act to prohibit the carrying on the slave trade from the United States to any foreign place or country, May 10, 1800, sec. 4 ; an act to vest more effectually in the state courts, and in the district courts ofthe United States, jurisdiction in the cases therein mentioned, March 3, 1815. Turner v. The Bank of North America, 4 Dall . 8 ; 1 Cond. Rep. 205.
The inferior courts of the United States, are all of limited jurisdiction , but they are not on that account inferior courts, in the technical sense of those words, whose judgments taken alone. are to be disregarded. If the jurisdiction be not alleged in the proceedings, they are erroneous, but they are not nullities. M'Cormick et al. v. Sullivant et al. , 10 Wheat. 192 ; 6 Cond. Rep. 71.
The justices of the supreme court have by practice and acquiescence under it, for a period of several years, commencing with the organization of the judicial system, sat as circuit judges : this practical ex-
position is too strong to be shaken or controlled . Stuart v. Laird, 1 Cranch, 299 ; 1 Cond. Rep. 316. The circuit court has jurisdiction on a bill in equity, filed by the United States , against the debtor of
their debtor, they claiming a priority under the fifty- fifth section of the act of March 2, 1'99, notwith-
standing the local law of the state allows a creditor to proceed against the debtor of his debtor by a peculiar process. The United States v. Howland et al., 4 Wheat. 108 ; 4 Cond. Rep. 404.

(a) The decisions of the Supreme Court ofthe United States, upon the provisions of this section, are : The law which empowers the supreme court to take cognizance of questions adjourned from a circuit court, gives jurisdiction over the single point on which the judges were divided ; not over the whole cause. Wayman et al. v. Southard et al. , 10 Wheat. 1 ; 6 Cond. Rep. 1 . Where the court is equally divided, the decree of the court below is of course affirmed , so far as the point of division goes. The Antelope, 10 Wheat. 66 ; 6 Cond. Rep. 30. The supreme court has no jurisdiction in a case in which the judges of the circuit court have divided in opinion upon a motion for a rule to show cause why the taxation of the costs of the marshal on an execution should not be reversed and corrected . Bank of the United States v. Green and others, 6 Peters, 26.
Where the court is equally divided in opinion upon a writ of error the judgment of the inferior court is affirmed. Etting v. The Bank of the United States, 11 Wheat. 59 ; 6 Cond. Rep. 216.
Where a case is certified to the supreme court upon a division of opinion of the judges of the circuit court, and the points upon which they were so divided, are too imperfectly stated to enable the supreme court to pronounce any opinion upon them, it will neither award a venire facias de novo, nor certify any opinion to the court below, but will merely certify that they are too imperfectly stated . Perkins v. Hart's Ex'r, & c., 11 Wheat. 237 ; 6 Cond. Rep. 287.
It appeared on a certificate from the circuit court of the United States of Pennsylvania, that the judges of the court were divided on a motion in arrest of judgment. Held, that judgment must be given on the verdict. United States v. Worrall , 2 Dall. 384.
Where a case is certified from a circuit court of the United States, the judges of the circuit court having differed in opinion upon questions of law which arose on the trial of the cause ; the supreme court cannot be called upon to express an opinion on the whole facts of the case, instead of upon particular points of law, growing out of the same. Adams, Cunningham & Co. v. Jones, 12 Peters, 207.
The intention of Congress, in passing the act authorizing a division of opinion of the judges of the circuit courts of the United States to be certified to the supreme court was, that a division of the judges of the circuit court, upon a single and material point, in the progress of the cause, should be certified to the supreme court for its opinion ; and not the whole cause. When a certificate of division brings up the whole cause, it would be, if the court should decide it, in effect, the exercise of original , rather than appellate jurisdiction. White v. Turk et al., 12 Peters, 238.
This case came up to the supreme court, from the circuit court, upon a division of opinion between the judges of the court. It was decided by the supreme court, that the question certified would , alone, be considered ; each party being left to bring up the whole case from the circuit court, by a writ of error. Ogle v. Lee, 2 Cranch, 33.
The question certified from the circuit court of North Carolina, was, " whether the act of assembly, (of North Carolina , ) entitled, an act concerning proving wills, and to prevent frauds in the management of intestates' estates, passed in 1715, recited in the plea of the defendants , was, under all the circumstances stated, and the various acts passed by the legislature of North Carolina, a bar to this action." The certificate stated, that the 9th section of the act had been pleaded by the defendant, in bar to the action . The certificate of the division was granted on the motion of the plaintiff, by his counsel ; and at his request, a statement of the facts, " made under the direction of the judges," was certified. The certificate, thus made out, set forth all the laws of North Carolina, which operated on the question certi. fied ; and stated the questions which arose in the cause, on which the opinions of the judges were divided. The court decided in favour of the plaintiff. Ogden, Adm'r of Cornell v. Blackledge, Ex'r of Sater, 2 Cranch, 272 ; 1 Cond. Rep. 411.
The certificate of division of opinion by the judges ofthe circuit court of Virginia, stated, " In this cause it occurred as a question , whether Hepburn and Dundas, the plaintiffs in this cause, who are citi. zens and residents in the District of Columbia ; and are so stated in the pleadings ; can maintain an action in the supreme court against the defendant, who is a citizen and inhabitant of the district and the commonwealth of Virginia, and is also stated so to be in the pleadings : or whether, for want of jurisdic . tion, the said suit ought to be dismissed ." It was certified that the circuit court had no jurisdiction in the case. Hepburn and Dundas v. Ellzey, 2 Cranch, 445 ; 1 Cond . Rep. 444.
This case was certified from the circuit court of Pennsylvania, the judges being divided in opinion upon the question, " whether, in the state of the pleadings, the judgment ought to be rendered for the plaintiffs." The supreme court said-Judgment, therefore, on the pleadings, must be rendered for the plaintiffs. Mr. Chief Justice Marshall, who delivered the opinion of the court, said : " By the twenty- sixth section ofthe judicial act, it is directed that, in cases of this description , the court shall render judgment for so much as is due according to equity. And when the sum for which judgment is to be rendered is uncertain, the same shall, if either of the parties request it, be assessed by a jury. In this case, it is the opinion of a majority of the court, that the judgment ought to be rendered for so much as remains due of the sum of one hundred and seventy thousand guilders, calculating interest thereon from the 1st of March, 1803 ; and if either of the parties request it, that a jury be empannelled to ascertain the value of this sum in money of the United States." United States v. Gurney and others, 4 Cranch, 333 ; 2 Cond. Rep. 132.
This case was certified on division of opinion, the question being, whether the assignee of a part of a patent right, cannot maintain an action on the case, for a violation of the patent right. The court certified that he could not. Tyler v. Tuel, 6 Cranch, 324.
In this case, the question certified, on which the judges of the circuit were divided in opinion, was

Cond. Rep. 492. The defendant was indicted in the circuit court of Vermont, under embargo laws, for loading carriages
with pearl ashes, with intent to export them. The jury found him guilty ; and that the ashes were worth two hundred and eighty dollars. The defendant moved in arrest of judgment, for defect in the finding ; and on the question presented by the motion , the judges were divided in opinion ; which division was certified to the supreme court. United States v. John Tyler, 7 Cranch, 285 ; 2 Cond. Rep. 492.
The question certified to the supreme court, from the circuit court of West Tennessee, was on the construction of the act of the legislature of Tennessee , relative to possession of lands. Patton's Lessee v. Easton, 1 Wheat. 476 ; 3 Cond. Rep. 631 .
The supreme court of the United States has no jurisdiction of causes brought before it, on a certificate of division of opinion of the judges of the circuit court, for the District of Columbia. The appellate jurisdiction extends, only, to the final judgment and decrees of that court. Ross v. Triplett, 3 Wheat. 600 ; 4 Cond. Rep. 351.
The question referred to the supreme court, by a certificate of division between the judges of the circuit court, on facts stated by the court, was, whether the circuit court of Kentucky could take jurisdiction of a case, when one of the grants for the land in controversy was issued out by the state ofVirginia, the other by the state of Kentucky, both grants being founded upon warrants and locations made under the laws of Virginia. Colson v. Lewis, 2 Wheat. 377 ; 4 Cond. Rep. 168.
The facts of the case being found by a special verdict, and the judges being divided in opinion on questions arising on the verdict, the questions were certified to the supreme court. Somerville's Ex'rs v. Hamilton, 4 Wheat . 230 ; 4 Cond. Rep. 436.
The difference of opinion of the judges of the circuit court of Delaware, was, whether certain depositions taken under a commission issued from the circuit court of Delaware, could be read in evidence. This difference was certified to the supreme court, and the question decided . Sergeant's Lessee v. Biddle et al. , 4 Wheat. 508 ; 4 Cond. Rep. 522.
On an indictment for manslaughter, the defendant was found guilty, subject to the opinion of the court,
whether the circuit court of Pennsylvania had jurisdiction in a case where the offence was committed on board an American ship, lying in the river Tigris, off Wampoa, in the empire of China. On the question of jurisdiction, the judges were divided in opinion , and the division was certified to the supreme court ; and was decided in favour of the defendant. United States v. Wiltberger, 5 Wheat. 76 ; 4 Cond. Rep. 593.
The jury found a special verdict, in the circuit court of Virginia, on a trial of an indictment for piracy ; and on a motion to arrest the judgment, the question whether the acts charged against the defendant, and found by the jury, was a piracy by the law of nations, so as to be punishable under the act of Congress of 3d March, 1819, was presented ; and the judges of the circuit court were divided in opinion ; and thereupon, the question was certified to the supreme court. United States v. Smith, 5 Wheat. 153 ; 4 Cond. Rep. 619.
The prisoners were found guilty in the circuit court of Massachusetts, for murder on the high seas, out of the jurisdiction of a particular state. The counsel of the prisoners moved the court for a new trial for the misdirection of the court on points of law which arose during the trial. The judges of the court being opposed in opinion upon questions presented with the motion ; the indictment, and a statement of the evidence, were certified to the supreme court. United States v. Holmes et al. , 5 Wheat. 412 ; 4 Cond. Rep. 708.
The defendant was indicted in the circuit court of South Carolina , charging him with wickedly and maliciously concealing a murder committed on the high seas, of which he had knowledge. The judge charged the jury, that the concealment, under the circumstances, was sufficient to convict the defendant, and the jury found him guilty. On a motion to arrest the judgment, and for a new trial, the judges were opposed in opinion on the motion , which was certified to the supreme court. The supreme court said, a motion for a new trial is not a part of the proceedings of the case. The question must be one which arises in a cause depending before the court, relative to a proceeding belonging to the cause. A motion
for a new trial has never before been brought to this court on a division of opinion in the circuit court. United States v. Daniel, 6 Wheat. 542 ; 5 Cond. Rep. 170.
On a trial of a writ of right in the circuit court of Kentucky, the judges of the court differed in opin. ion on questions as to the constitutionality of certain laws of Kentucky, giving to occupying claimants of land, the value of their improvements.

Miller v. Stewart, 9 Wheat. 680 ; 5 Cond. Rep. 727.
This cause was certified from the circuit court of the district of Kentucky, upon a division of opinion between the judges of that court, on several questions which occurred, on a motion made by the plaintiff, to quash the marshal's return on an execution issued on a judgment obtained in that court on a replevin bond ; and also to quash the replevin bond taken on the execution , for the causes assigned in the motion. The court divided in opinion on the points stated in the motion , and the same were certified to the supreme court. Wayman et al. v. Southard , 10 Wheat, 1 ; 6 Cond. Rep. 1.

The defendants , Kelly and others, were indicted in the circuit court of Pennsylvania, for feloniously endeavouring to make a revolt on the high seas, on board of a merchant vessel of the United States.
They were found guilty ; and their counsel moved to arrest the judgment, on the ground , " that the act of Congress does not define the offence of making a revolt, and that it was not competent to the court to give a judicial definition of a crime heretofore unknown."

The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, " if, on points reserved, the court should be of opinion that the law is for the plaintiff; if not, for the defendant." The opinions of the judges being opposed, the cause was removed to the supreme court, upon a certificate of disagreement upon points stated, and the special verdict. The points were, that the whole evidence and certain letters, show a subsisting and open agreement at the time of action brought ; that the whole evidence constitutes a special agreement, &c.; that the plaintiff cannot recover on two items of the account, &c. The supreme court held the points imperfectly stated, and refused to give a certificate of their opinion. Perkins v. Hart's Ex'r, 11 Wheat. 237 ; 6 Cond. Rep. 287.

It was certified , accordingly, to the circuit court. Devereaux v. Marr, 12 Wheat. 212 ; 6 Cond. Rep. 522.
In this case, an action of debt was brought in the circuit court of Rhode Island, on two bonds given, conditioned that N. H. should remain a true prisoner within the limits of the prison .

The judges of the circuit court were opposed in opinion, as to the validity of the discharge ; and the same was certified to the supreme court. Mason v. Haile, 12 Wheat. 370 ; 6 Cond. Rep . 535.
An action was instituted in the circuit court of the United States for the southern district of New York,
against the drawer, upon nine several bills of exchange, and a verdict was taken for the plaintiffs, subject to the opinion of the court, on a case agreed. The judges of the circuit court being divided in opinion upon certain points, the same was certified to the supreme court. The case stated formed a part of the record sent up to the supreme court. The supreme court directed the opinion of the court to be certified on each of the points, on which the judges of the circuit court had been divided in opinion ; and which were argued before it. Schimmelpennich et al. v. Bayard et al. , 1 Peters, 264.
This case came before the court on a certificate of a division of opinion between the judges of the circuit court of the southern district of New York ; the court having divided in opinion on a motion for

execution, after a verdict against the sureties of a postmaster, for the plaintiff. The circuit court directed

An action was instituted in the circuit court of Kentucky on a promissory note, by the Bank of the United States and the defendants filed a plea, setting forth circumstances which brought up the question of usury, in the discounting of the note. The plaintiffs demurred ; and the judges of the circuit court
differed in opinion on the questions raised by the pleadings : 1. Whether the facts set forth in the plea, made out a case of usury. 2. Whether, if there was usury in the case, the note is invalid, so that no recovery can be had thereon . 3. Whether, if not wholly void , a part of the note can be recovered. Bank of the United States v. Owens and others, 2 Peters , 527.

A writ of right was brought in the circuit court of the southern district of New York, and the judges of the court were opposed in opinion on questions presented in the trial of the cause, on the pleadings , and on the merits.

questions on which the judges were opposed were certified to the supreme court. Inglis v. The Trustees of the Sailor's Snug Harbor, 3 Peters , 99.
The questions on which the judges of the circuit court of North Carolina were opposed in opinion , arose in an action instituted against the defendant, to recover damages for neglecting to institute a suit against the indorser of a promissory note, until after the remedy was barred by the statute of limitations.
The question certified to the supreme court, arose on the finding of the jury for the plaintiff, subject to the opinion of the court, whether the statute of limitations was not a bar to the plaintiff's action against the defendant. Wilcox et al . v. The Ex'rs of Plummer, 4 Peters, 172.
On inspecting the record, it was perceived that the judges of the circuit court of Rhode Island, instead of dividing on one or more points, had divided on the whole case, and had directed the whole case to be certified to the supreme court. Considering this as irregular, the supreme court directed the cause to be remanded to the circuit court, that further proceedings may be had therein according to law. Saunders v. Gould , 4 Peters, 392.

nessee, and the judges of the court were opposed in opinion on questions which arose on the plaintiff's demurrers to the defendant's pleas ; and also whether the averment of the citizenship of some of the parties to the suit was sufficient. A certificate of this division of opinion was, by the direction of the
circuit court, made to the supreme court , according to law. Kirkman v. Hamilton, 6 Peters , 20.
The judges of the circuit court of North Carolina were opposed in opinion, on a question, whether the priority to which the United States are entitled in case of a general assignment made by a debtor, comprehends a bond for duties executed anterior to the assignment, but not payable until after the same. The question was certified to the supreme court. United States v. The State Bank of North Carolina, 6 Peters, 29.
In this case the defendant was indicted and convicted of robbing the United States' mail, and being pardoned by the President of the United States , a question arose in the circuit court of the United States, whether the defendant should plead the pardon. On this question the judges of the court were opposed in opinion, and the question was certified to the supreme court, for its decision . United States v. Wilson, 7 Peters, 150.
This case was submitted to the circuit court, on a statement of facts agreed upon by the counsel ofthe plaintiff, and the district attorney of the United States. The whole of the agreed facts were sent up with the record. Upon the trial and statement of facts in the cause, certain questions had occurred , on which the opinions of the judges were opposed ; and the points of disagreement were certified to the supreme court for their decision . The court decided on all the questions certified, with one exception. Harris v. Elliott, 10 Peters , 25.
An action of assumpsit was commenced by the plaintiff against the collector of the port of New York , to recover a sum paid to him for duties on certain goods ; the goods not being liable, under the law, to the duties charged by the collector. On the trial of the cause, the judges of the circuit court of the southern district of New York were opposed in opinion, as to the construction of the act of Congress, by which the duties were claimed ; and being so opposed in opinion, the question as to the construction of the law was certified to the supreme court for decision . Elliott v. Swartwout, 10 Peters, 137.
An action of detinue was instituted in the circuit court of West Tennessee , to recover a slave . During the progress of the suit, the defendant died ; and his personal representative moved to dismiss the suit, on the ground that it did not survive. On this motion, the judges of the court were divided in opinion ; and the same was certified, for its decision, to the supreme court. Davis v. Braden , 10 Peters, 286.
A question, whether a plaintiff in ejectment shall be permitted to enlarge the term in the demise , is one within the discretion of the court, to which the motion for the purpose is submitted ; and it cannot be certified to the supreme court, if the judges of the circuit court are divided in opinion . Lanning's Lessee v. Vaughan et al. , 10 Peters, 366.
Questions respecting the practice of the circuit court in equity cases, which depend on the sound discretion of the court, in the application of the rules which regulate the course of equity proceedings, to the circumstances of such particular case ; are not questions which can be certified, on a division of opinion of the circuit court. Packer v. Nixon, 10 Peters, 408.
The questions certified to the supreme court were , whether, on certain facts which were in evidence in the cause, the deed was admissible in evidence , under the acts of the legislatures of North Carolina and Tennessee ; and whether certain evidence, which was given on the trial, did or did not conduce to prove that the defendants purchased under a particular person. On these questions, the judges of the circuit court of Tennessee were opposed in opinion ; and the same were certified, and answered by the supreme court. Denn, Lessee of Scott v. Reid et al. , 10 Peters, 524.
An action of debt was instituted on an act of the legislature of New York, to recover certain penalties, for bringing into the state of New York certain paupers, in violation of the provisions of the act. The declaration set out the law of New York, and the breach of its provisions, by the defendant. The defendant demurred to the declaration, and the plaintiff joined in the demurrer. The judges of the circuit court of the southern district of New York were opposed in opinion on the question ; whether the act of the legislature of New York, mentioned in the declaration, assumes to regulate commerce between the port of New York and foreign ports. This was certified to the supreme court. City of New York v. Milne, 11 Peters , 102.
The defendant was indicted for forging a bill of the Bank of the United States ; and the judges of the circuit court of the United States for the Pennsylvania district, being opposed in opinion , whether the same was a bill of the Bank of the United States , according to the eighteenth section of the act, granting a charter to the bank ; the same, with the indictment, was certified to the supreme court for its decision. United States v. Brewster, 7 Peters, 164.
The opinions of the judges of the circuit court of Pennsylvania were opposed in opinion, on a question arising on a demurrer, by the United States, to a plea of autre fois acquit, to an indictment for passing a counterfeit bank note of the Bank of the United States ; and the same was certified to the supreme court. United States v. Randenbush, 8 Peters, 288.
The judges of the circuit court of Massachusetts were opposed in opinion on five points which arose on the trial, before a jury, of the cause ; and they were, with all the evidence, certified to the supreme court for its decision." Carrington et al. v. The Merchants' Ins. Co. , 8 Peters, 495.

(a) Decisions of the Supreme Court on Louisiana land titles :-By the treaty of St. Ildefonso , made on the 1st of October, 1800, Spain ceded Louisiana to France ; and France, by the treaty of Paris , signed the 30th of April, 1803, ceded it to the United States. Under this treaty the United States claimed the countries between the Iberville and the Perdido. Spain contended that her cession to France compre. hended only that territory which at the time of the cession was denominated Louisiana, consisting ofthe island of New Orleans, and the country which had been originally ceded to her by France, west of the Mississippi. The land claimed by the plaintiffs in error, under a grant from the crown of Spain, made after the treaty of St. Ildefonso, lies within the disputed territory ; and this case presents the question, to whom did the country between the Iberville and Perdido belong after the treaty of St. Ildefonso ? Had France and Spain agreed upon the boundaries of the retroceded territory , before Louisiana was acquired by the United States, that agreement would undoubtedly have ascertained its limits. But the declarations of France, made after parting with the province, cannot be admitted as conclusive. In questions of this character, political considerations have too much influence over the conduct of nations, to permit their declarations to decide the course of an independent government, in a matter vitally interesting to itself. Foster et al. v. Neilson , 2 Peters, 254.
If a Spanish grantee had obtained possession of the land in dispute so as to be the defendant, would a
court of the United States maintain his title under a Spanish grant, made subsequent to the acquisition of Louisiana, singly on the principle that the Spanish construction of the treaty of St. Ildefonso was right, and the American construction wrong ? Such a decision would subvert those principles which
govern the relations between the legislative and judicial departments, and mark the limits of each. Ibid. 309.
The sound construction of the 8th article of the treaty between the United States and Spain, of the 22d of February, 1829 , will not enable the court to apply its provisions to the case of the plaintiff. Ibid. 314.
The article does not declare that all the grants made by his Catholic majesty before the 24th of January, 1818 , shall be valid to the same extent as if the ceded territories had remained under his dominion .
It does not say that those grants are hereby confirmed. Had such been its language, it would have acted
directly on the subject, and it would have repealed those acts of Congress which were repugnant to it; but its language is that those grants shall be ratified and confirmed to the persons in possession, &c. By
whom shall they be ratified and confirmed ? This seems to be the language of contract ; and if it is, the ratification and confirmation which are promised must be the act of the legislature. Until such act shall
be passed, the court is not at liberty to disregard the existing laws on the subject. Ibid. The controversy in relation to the country lying between the Mississippi and the Perdido rivers, and
the validity of the grants made by Spain in the disputed territory, after the cession of Louisiana to the United States, were carefully examined and decided in the case of Foster and Elam v. Neilson . The supreme court, in that case, decided that the question of boundary between the United States and Spain was a question for the political departments of the government ; that the legislative and executive branches having decided the question, the courts of the United States are bound to regard the boundary determined by them as the true one ; that grants made by the Spanish authorities of lands, which, according to this boundary line belonged to the United States, gave no title to the grantees, in opposition to those claiming under the United States ; unless the Spanish grants were protected by the subsequent arrangements made between the two governments ; and that no such arrangements were to be found in the treaty of 1819, by which Spain ceded the Floridas to the United States, according to the fair import of its words, and its true construction. Garcia v. Lee, 12 Peters, 511.
In the case of Foster and Elam v. Neilson, the supreme court said, that the Florida treaty of 1919
declares that all grants made before the 24th January, 1818, by the Spanish authorities, " shall be ratified and confirmed to the persons in possession of the lands, to the same extent that the same grants would
be valid, if the territories had remained under the dominion of his Catholic majesty :" and in deciding the case of Foster and Elam, the court held that even if this stipulation applied to lands in the territory in question, yet the words used did not import a present confirmation by virtue of the treaty itself, but
that they were words of contract ; " that the ratification and confirmation , which were promised, must be the act of the legislature ; and until such shall be passed, the court is not at liberty to disregard the existing laws on the subject." Afterwards, in the case of the United States v. Percheman , 7 Peters, 86,
in reviewing the words of the eighth article of the treaty, the court, for the reasons there assigned , came to a different conclusion ; and held that the words were words of present confirmation, by the treaty, where the land had been rightfully granted before the cession ; and that it did not need the aid of an act
of Congress to ratify and confirm the grant. This language was, however, applied by the court, and was intended to apply to grants made in a territory which belonged to Spain at the time of the grant. The case then before the court was one of that description. It was in relation to a grant of land in Florida,
which unquestionably belonged to Spain at the time the grant was made ; and where the Spanish authorities had an undoubted right to grant, until the treaty of cession in 1819. It is of such grants that the court speak, when they declare them to be confirmed and protected by the true construction of the treaty ; and that they do not need the aid of an act of Congress to ratify and confirm the title of the purchaser. The court do not apply this principle to grants made within the territory of Louisiana. The case of Foster
and Elam v. Neilson, must in all other respects be considered as affirmed by the case of Percheman ; as it underwent a careful examination in that case, and as none of its principles were questioned , except that referred to. Garcia v. Lee , 12 Peters, 511.
The acts of the commissioners appointed to adjust and settle land titles in Louisiana, under the acts of Congress authorizing and confirming the same, are conclusive as to all titles to lands which have been confirmed, according to the provisions of the different acts of Congress on the subject. Strother v. Lu cas, 12 Peters, 410. See also The United States v. Percheman , 7 Peters , 86.

(a) Destroying a vessel at sea to the injury of the underwriters. Under the second section of the act of March 26th, 1804, chap. 40, on an indictment for destroying a vessel with intent to prejudice the underwriters, it is sufficient to show the existence of an association actually carrying on the business of insurance, by whose known officers, de facto, the policy was executed, and to prejudice whom the vessel was destroyed ; without proving the existence of a legal corporation authorized to insure, or a compliance onthe part of such corporation with the terms of its charter, or the validity of the policy of insurance. United States v. Amedy, 11 Wheat. 392 ; 6 Cond. Rep. 362.
The law not making it an offence in the owner to destroy his vessel to the prejudice of the underwri ters or the cargo, no evidence can be given to establish charges against the defendant for such destruc-
tion, to the prejudice of the underwriters on the cargo, even if the indictment contained such a charge. Evidence of the value of the property insured may be given to show inducements to destroy or preserve it. The United States v. Richard Johns, 1 Wash. C. C. R. 363.
It is necessary in the indictment to state that the intent was to prejudice the underwriters. Ibid.
The prosecutor on an indictment for destroying a vessel , must show that the insurance is a valid insurance, and if made by an incorporated insurance company, the act of incorporation must be shown, and the contract of insurance must be shown to have been executed. Ibid.
The legal meaning of the term " destroy" by the act of Congress is to unfit the vessel for service
beyond the hope of ordinary means. This, as to the extent of the injury, is synonymous with " cast away." Both mean , such an act as causes the vessel to perish and to be lost, or to be irrecoverable by ordinary means. Ibid.

(a) See note to chapter 53, post, page 297, Navy Pension Fund. By an act passed 10th July, 1832 , Congress authorized the appointment of a separate and permanent navy agent at Washington , and directed the performance of the duties, " not only for the navy yard in the City of Washington , but from the navy department, under the direction of the Secretary of the Navy, in the payment of such accounts and claims as the secretary may direct." These duties would not have been so specially stated in this act, if they had been considered by Congress as coming within the ordinary duties of an agent of the navy yard atWashington , under the act of 1804. But independent of this consideration , it is enough to know, that the duties in question were discharged by the defendant, under the construction given to the law by the Secretary of the Navy. United States v. Macdaniel, 7 Peters, 1.
The United States instituted a suit to recover a balance charged on the books of the treasury department, against the defendant, who was a clerk in the navy department, upon a fixed annual salary, and acted as agent for the payment of moneys due to the navy pensioners, the privateer pensioners, and for navy disbursements, for the payment of which, funds were placed in his hands by government. He claimed these commissions at the treasury, and the claim had been there rejected by the accounting offi-

cers, and ifthey had allowed the same, he was not now indebted to the government. The United States, on the trial ofthe case in the circuit court, denied the right of the defendant to these commissions, as they
had not been allowed to him by any department of the government, and asserted that the jury had not power to allow them on the trial. By the Court- The rejection of the claim to commissions by the treasury department, formed no objection to the admission of it as evidence of offset before the jury. Had the claim never been presented to the department, it could not have been admitted as evidence by the court. But, as it had been made out in form and presented to the proper accounting officers, and had been rejected, the circuit court did right in submitting it to the jury, if the claim was considered as equitable. Ibid.
It would be a novel principle to refuse payment to the subordinates of a department because their chief, under whose direction they had faithfully served the public , had given an erroneous construction to the law. Ibid.
The Secretary of the Navy, in authorizing the defendant to make the disbursements on which the claim for compensation is founded, did not transcend those powers, which, under the circumstances of the case, he might well exercise. Ibid.

(a) Under the act of Congress of March 3, 1803, chap. 27, entitled, " An act regulating grants of lands , and providing for the disposal of the lands of the United States south ofthe state of Tennessee," such lands only were authorized to be offered for sale as had not been appropriated by the previous sections of the law, and certificates granted in pursuance thereof. A right therefore to a particular grant of land, derived from a donation certificate given under the law, is superior to the title of any one who purchased the same land at the public sales, unless there is some fatal infirmity in the certificate which renders it void. Ross v. Barland et al ., 1 Peters , 666.
The act of Congress requires no precise form for the donation certificate. It is sufficient if the proofs be exhibited to the court of the commissioners to satisfy them of the facts entitling the party to the certificate. It is sufficient if the consideration , the occupancy, and the quantity granted appears : nothing
more is necessary to certify to the government the party's right, or to enable him, after it is surveyed by the proper officer, to obtain a patent. Ibid.
The 2d section of the act of March 3, 1803, was intended to confer a bounty on a numerous class of individuals ; and in construing the ambiguous words of the section, it is the duty of the court to adopt that construction which will best effect the liberal intentions of the legislature. bid.
The time when the territory over which the law operated was evacuated by the Spanish troops , was very important, as the law was intended to provide for those who were actually, at that time, inhabitants of, and cultivated the soil within it ; but whether it was in 1797 or 1798 , was comparatively unimportant.
The decision ofthe commissioners upon the period when the evacuation took place is sufficient ; and the court are disposed to adopt the construction of the act given by the commissioners, west of Pearl river, that the evacuation took place on the 30th March, 1798, by which persons claiming within the objects of the section were entitled to certificates. Ibid.
Congress have treated as erroneous the construction given to the law by the commissioners to settle claims to lands east of Pearl river ; who have decided that only those who have settled on the lands within
the territory in the year 1797, were entitled to donation certificates, and who had granted to others preemption certificates. Ibid.
The commissioners appointed under the act of Congress relative to claims to lands south of the state
of Tennessee, were authorized to hear evidence as to the time of the actual evacuation of the territory by the Spanish troops, and to decide upon the fact. The law gave them power to hear and decide all matters respecting such claims , and to determine thereon according to justice and equity, and declared their deliberations shall be final. The court are bound to presume that every fact necessary to warrant
the certificate in the terms of it, was proved before the commissioners ; and that subsequently it was shown to them that the final evacuation of the territory took place on the 30th March, 1798. Ibid.
It is the settled doctrine of the judicial department of the government of the United States, that the treaty of 1819 with Spain, ceded to the United States, no territory west of the Perdido river. It had already been acquired under the Louisiana treaty. Pollard's Lessee v. Files, 2 Howard's Sup. Court Rep. 591.
In the interval between the Louisiana treaty, and the time when the United States took possession of the territory west of the Perdido , the Spanish government had a right to grant permits to settle and improve by cultivation , and to authorize the erection of establishments for mechanical purposes. Ibid.
These incipient concessions were not regarded by Congress, but are recognized in the acts of 1804, 1812, 1819, and as claims are within the acts of 1824. Ibid.

Soulard et al. v . The United States, 4 Peters, 511 .
The term property, as applied to lands, comprehends every species of title, inchoate or complete. It is supposed to embrace those rights which lie in contract, those which are executory as well as those which are executed. In this respect the relation of the inhabitants of Louisiana to their government is not changed. The new government takes the place of that which has passed away. Ibid.

CHAP. XXI. --An Act relating to bonds given by Marshals. (a)

(a) By the 27th section of the act of September 24, 1789, chap . 20 , vol . i. 87, the appointment of a marshal in each district, is provided for, and his duties and powers regulated.
The decisions of the courts of the United States as to the duties, powers, and liabilities of Marshals are :-
The marshal may have an attachment to enforce the payment of his fees of office, against suitors in the court ; so also against the endorser on the writ, who by the lex loci, is liable to respond for costs. Anonymous, 2 Gallis. C. C. R. 101 .
The marshal is entitled to his full commissions according to the act of 1799 , chap. 19, upon all interlocutory sales of prize property. The act of 27th January , 1813 , applies only to sales after final condemnation. The Avery, 2 Gallis. C. C. R. 308.
It is the duty of the marshal , upon all interlocutory sales , to bring the proceeds into court, with a regular account of the sales. Ibid.
The marshal is entitled to commissions upon prize property, removed from his district, by consent of parties, and there sold . The San Jose Indiana, 2 Gallis. C. C. R. 311 .
After a rule on the marshal to return the capias ad satisfaciendum issued against the defendants, on the return of the marshal that the plaintiff had directed him not to serve the writ on one defendant, and that the other could not be found, the court have nothing more to do with the rule. If the marshal has misconducted himself, the remedy is an action for a false return. Segourney v. Ingraham et al ., 2 Wash. C. C. R. 336.
Where an individual, acting in pursuance of what he conceives a just claim to property, proceeds by legal process to enforce it, and causes a levy to be made on property which is claimed by another, without abusing or perverting its true object, there is and ought to be a very different rule for damages, from the case in which vindictive damages may be allowed , if after a due course of legal investigation , his case is not well founded. Where the defendant had acted as the marshal of the United States, in the execution of his duties as a public officer, and had made a levy, but had done nothing out of the strictest line of duty, the circuit court instructed the jury to allow compensation for the injury sustained, and nothing more. Pacific Ins . Co. v. Conard , Baldwin's C. C. R. 143.
It has long been settled that a jury ought not in any case to find exemplary damages against a public officer, acting in obedience to orders from the government, without any circumstances of aggravation, if he violates the law in making a seizure of property. Ibid.
A marshal is not removed by the appointment of a new one, until he receives notice of such appointment ; all acts done by the old marshal after the appointment of a new one, before notice, are good ; but his acts subsequent to notice are void. Wallace's C. C. R. 119.
If a debtor, committed to the state jail under process from the courts of the United States, escape, the marshal is not liable. Randolph v. Donaldson, 9 Cranch, 76 ; 3 Cond. Rep. 280.
The act of Congress has limited the responsibility of the marshal to his own acts and the acts of his deputies. The keeper of a state jail is, neither in fact nor in law, the deputy of the marshal ; he is not appointed by, nor removable at the will of the marshal. When a prisoner is regularly committed to a state jail by the marshal, he is no longer in the custody of the marshal , or controllable by him. Ibid.
If a marshal, before the date of his official bond , receive, upon an execution , money due to the United States, with orders from the comptroller to pay it into the Bank of the United States, which he neglects to do, the sureties in his official bond, executed afterwards , are not liable therefor upon the bond ; although the money remain in the marshal's hands after the execution of the bond. The United States v. Giles and others, 9 Cranch, 212 ; 3 Cond. Rep. 377.
Query. Whether the sureties in a marshal's bond conditioned for the faithful execution of his duty, " during his continuance in the said office ," are liable for money received by him after his removal from office, upon an execution which remained in his hands at the time of such removal ? Ibid.
The comptroller of the treasury has a right to direct the marshal to whom he shall pay money received upon executions, and a payment according to such directions is good ; and it seems he may avail himself of it upon the trial without having submitted it as a claim to the accounting officers of the treasury. Ibid.
It is the duty ofthe marshal of a court of the United States , to execute all process which may be placed in his hands ; but he performs this duty at his peril , and under the guidance of law. He must, of course, exercise some judgment in the performance. Should he fail to obey the exigit of the writ without a legal excuse, or should he in its letter violate the rights of others, he is liable to the action of the injured party. Life and Fire Ins. Co. of New York v. Adams, 9 Peters , 573 .
The marshal makes distribution of proceeds of prize sales in his hands, at his peril ; and on his mis. payment a libel lies against him. For safety the marshal should obtain the order of the court, which ought not to be made without previous measures guarding against fraud, and providing for latent claims. Keene et al. v. The Gloucester, 2 Dallas, 36.

The marshal is bound to serve a subpoena in chancery as soon as he reasonably can ; and he will, in case of neglect, be answerable to the complainant, who may have sustained a loss in consequence of his neglect. Kennedy v. Brent, 6 Cranch, 187 ; 2 Cond . Rep. 345.
The court will not dictate to the marshal what return he shall make to process in his hands ; he must return it at his peril ; and any person injured by it, may have his legal remedy for the return. Wortman v. Conyngham, Peters' C. C. R. 241.
The return of the marshal to a writ, cannot be traversed in an action between the parties to the suit in which the writ issued. Wilson v. The Executor of Hurst, Peters' C. C. R. 441 .
An officer of the United States, who has levied a sum of money on an execution in favour of the United States, to whom the United States are indebted for fees of office in a sum greater than the amount of the execution, has a right to retain it by way of set-off; and on a motion made on the part of the United States to commit the officer for failure to pay over the money so levied, he will be permitted to show that the United States are indebted to him: and if this be shown, it is sufficient cause why he should not be attached. United States v. Mann , 2 Brockenb. C. C. R. 9.
A marshal is liable upon his official bond, for the failure of his deputy to serve original process ; but the measure of his liability is the extent of the injury received by the plaintiff, produced by such negligence. If the loss of the debt be the direct legal consequence of the failure to serve the process, the amount of the debt is the measure of damage ; but the mere failure to execute the process, does not, in itself, necessarily infer the loss of the debt to the plaintiff, by the negligence of the officer, because the plaintiff might sue out other process, on the failure of the officer to execute the first process. The question, whether the loss of the debt was or was not the direct legal consequence of the negligence of the officer, is a question of fact, depending on circumstances, of which the jury must judge. United States v. Moore's Administrators, 2 Brockenb. C. C. R. 317.
Where a writ of capias ad respondendum , comes to the hands of a deputy marshal , who arrests the debtor, and the debtor thereupon pays to the deputy the amount of the debt for which he was sued, and the officer discharges the debtor from custody, and returns the writ, " debt and costs satisfied," this is not an official act which binds his principal. The deputy marshal is a mere ministerial officer, and he has no right to adjust the debt, and make himself responsible to the plaintiff. He is bound to pursue the mandate of the writ, and that requires him to arrest the debtor, and take bail. The discharge of the debtor from custody, without taking bail, is indeed a misfeasance in office, for which his principal , the marshal , is responsible ; but he is only responsible for the injury done to the plaintiff. The return ofthe deputy, shows that no bail was taken ; and if by taking out other process, the plaintiff could have secured his debt, which is a fact to be determined by the jury ; the loss of the debt to the plaintiff, is not the necessary legal consequence of the conduct of the deputy, and no injury, in a legal sense, is done to the plaintiff thereby. Ibid.
Where a decree directs an officer of the court to sell property, " and bring the proceeds of sale into
court," and the sale is on a credit of one, two, and three years, and bonds are given for the payment of the instalments, these bonds are the immediate proceeds of sale. As a matter of convenience, they may be permitted to remain in the hands of the officer ; but as matter of strict right, the creditor may require that they shall be brought into court. Wallis v. Thornton's Administrators et al . 2 Brockenb. C. C. R. 422.
Where bonds are made payable to the marshal of a court, he has a right to collect them. In such case, the marshal must be considered as a trustee for the creditor. Query. Whether the direction to take bond implies, that it shall be taken to the marshal, rather than to the creditor ? Where bonds are
taken, not to the marshal and his successors, but to J. P. , marshal , &c. , his executors, administrators , and assigns, could his successor, in the event of the marshal being changed before the money is paid, act on these bonds without an assignment ? Ibid.
By the 69th section of the collection act of 1799 , ch. 22, the goods or merchandise seized under that act, are to be put into custody of the collector, or such other persons as he may appoint for that purpose, no longer than until the proper proceedings are instituted under the 89th section of the same act, to ascertain whether they are forfeited or not ; and as soon as the marshal seizes the goods under the proper process of the court, the marshal is entitled to the sole and exclusive custody thereof, subject to the future orders of the court. Ex parte Jesse Hoyt, Collector of the Port of New York, 13 Peters, 279.
By the statute of Indiana, the marshal on a replevy bond is required to take one or more sufficient freehold securities, and if freehold security be not taken , the marshal is liable. Bispham v. Taylor, 2 M'Lean's C. C. R. 355.
If the sureties be not freeholders, however ample at the time they may have been considered, the marshal is liable. In this respect the statute must be pursued. Ibid.
To examine the county records, is not an unreasonable duty on the marshal. Ibid. Where the marshal takes insufficient bail for the appearance of a defendant, he is only answerable for
the actual injury sustained by the plaintiff. In such a case the insolvency of the defendant may be shown in mitigation of damages. Ibid.
But where a judgment is replevied , good freehold security must be taken for the payment of the judg ment. If insufficient security be taken, the marshal is liable. Ibid.

If a collector justify the detention of a vessel under the 11th section of the embargo law of April 25, 1808, he need not show that his opinion was correct, nor that he used reasonable care and diligence in ascertaining the facts upon which his opinion was founded. It is sufficient if he honestly entertained the opinion in which he acted. Otis v. Watkins, 9 Cranch, 339 ; 3 Cond. Rep. 424.

If a suit be brought against the seizing officer for a supposed trespass in making a seizure of a vessel for a supposed forfeiture, while the suit is depending, the fact of such pendency may be pleaded in abatement, or as a temporary bar to the action ; if after a decree of condemnation, then that fact may be pleaded as a bar ; if after an acquittal without a certificate of probable cause, then the officer is without any justification for the seizure, and it is definitively settled to be a tortious act. Gelston et al . v. Hoyt, 3 Wheat. 246 ; 4 Cond. Rep. 244.
To justify a seizure there must be probable cause of seizure ; and if an officer of the customs seize without probable cause, no indictment lies for resisting him in the seizure, for he is not in the execution of his office. United States v. Gay, 2 Gallis. C. C. R. 359.
Seizures for breach of municipal laws, are made at the peril of the seizers. If made without probable cause, the seizers are liable for all the consequences ; for the act is construed a tortious act, and his
diligence for the preservation of the property, is no defence against losses occasioned by the superior force, or inevitable casualty. Burke v. Trevitt, 1 Mason's C. C. R. 96.
(a) Indictment in the circuit court of North Carolina, for the forging of, and an attempt to pass a certain paper writing in imitation of, and purporting to be, a bill or note issued by the president and directors of the Bank of the United States, provided in the 18th section of the act of 1816 , establishing the Bank of the United States. The note was signed with the name of " John Huske," who had not
been at any time president of the Bank of the United States ; but who at the date of the counterfeiting was president of the office of discount at Fayetteville ; and was countersigned by the name of " John W. Sanford," who at no time was cashier of the mother Bank, but was at the said date cashier of the said office of discount and deposit. Held, that this was an offence within the provisions of the law. United States v. Turner, 7 Peters, 132.
Indictment on the 18th section of the act of Congress, entitled, " An act to incorporate the Bank of the United States," passed April 15, 1816. The indictment charged the defendant with uttering and forging " a counterfeit bill in imitation of a bill used by the president, &c. , of the bank." The forged paper was in these words and figures : " Cashier of the Bank of the United States, pay C. W. Earnest or order, five dollars. Office of discount and deposit in Pittsburg, 10th day of December, 1829. A. Brackenridge, Pres't, J. Correy, Cash'r." " Pay bearer, C. W. Earnest." Held, that a genuine instrument of which the forged and counterfeited instrument is an imitation, is not a bill issued by order of the president of the Bank of the United States, according to the true intent and meaning of the 18th section of the act incorporating the bank. The United States v. Brewster, 7 Peters, 164.
Counterfeiting an indorsement on a post note of the Bank of the United States, is not an offence under the 18th section of the act incorporating the bank. United States v. Stewart, 4 Wash. C. C. R. 226.
In a prosecution for forging the notes of the Bank of the United States, it is not necessary to prove that it was committed with intention to defraud some corporation or person, and that the notes stated in the indictment, and given in evidence as forged, and those alleged to be forged, are the same. United States v. Reuben Moses , 4 Wash. C. C. R. 726.
An order on the cashier of the Bank of the United States, is evidence for supporting an indictment for forging an order on the cashier of the corporation of the Bank of the United States. United States v. Hinman, Baldwin's C. C. R. 292.

CHAP. XXI.-An Act to extend the time for locating Virginia military [land] warrants, for returning surveys thereon to the office of the Secretary ofthe department of War, and appropriating lands for the use of schools, in the Virginia military reservation, in lieu of those heretofore appropriated. (a)
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the officers and soldiers

(a) Under the reserve contained in the cession act of Virginia, and under the acts of Congress of August 10, 1790, and of June 9, 1794, the whole country lying between the Sciota and Little Miami rivers, was subjected to military warrants, to satisfy which the reserve was made. Doddridge v. Thompson, 9 Wheat. 469 ; 5 Cond. Rep. 645.
The territory lying between the two rivers, is the whole country from their sources to their mouths ; and if no branch of either of them has acquired the name exclusively of another, the main branch to its source must be considered the true river. Ibid.
The act of June 26, 1812, to ascertain the western boundary ofthe tract reserved for military warrants, and which provisionally designates Ludlow's line , as the western boundary, did not invalidate the titleto the land between that line and Roberts's line, acquired under a Virginia military warrant previous to the passage of that act. Ibid.
The land between Ludlow's and Roberts's line was not withdrawn from the territory liable to be surveyed for military warrants by any act of Congress passed before the act of June 12, 1812. Ibid.
The reservation made by the law of Virginia of 1783, ceding to Congress the territory northwest of the river Ohio, is not a reservation of the whole tract of country between the rivers Sciota and Little Miami. It is a reservation of only so much as may be necessary to make up any deficiency ofgood land in the country set apart for the officers and soldiers of the Virginia line on continental establishment, on the southeast side of the Ohio. The residue of the lands are ceded to the United States as a common
fund for those states who come or might become members of the Union ; to be disposed of for that purpose. Jackson v. Clarke et al. , 1 Peters , 635.
Although the military lands constituted the primary claim upon the trust, that claim was according to the intention of the parties so to be satisfied, as still to keep in view the interests of the Union , which were also vital objects of the trust. This was only to be effected by prescribing the time in which the lands to be appropriated by those claimants should be separated from the general mass, so as to enable the government to apply the residue to the general purposes of the trust. Ibid.
If the right existed in Congress to prescribe the time in which military warrants should be located, the right to annex conditions to its extension , follows as a necessary consequence. Ibid.
If it be conceded that the proviso in the act of March 2, 1807 , was not intended for the protection of surveys which were in themselves absolutely void , it must be admitted that it was intended to protect

Lands surveyed are as completely withdrawn from the common mass, as lands patented. It cannot be

said that the prohibition that " no location shall be made on tracts of land for which patents have pre-

viously been issued , or which had been previously surveyed," was intended only for valid and regular

surveys. They did not require legislative aid. The clause was introduced for the protection of defective

entries and surveys, which might be made in quiet times. Ibid.

Under the peculiar system of the Virginia land law, as it has been settled in Kentucky and the military

district in Ohio, by usages adapted to the circumstances of the country, many principles are established,

which are unknown to the common law. A long course of adjudication has fixed these principles, and

they are considered as the settled rules by which these military titles are to be governed. ` Galt v. Gallo-

(a) Cases decided upon the embargo acts of December 22, 1807, chap. 5 : January 9, 1808, chap. 8 : March 12, 1808 , chap . 33 : April 25, 1808, chap. 66 : and January 9, 1809, chap. 5 :-
Where a vessel had been driven by stress of weather into a port, in the West Indies, while proceeding to Portland in Maine, and there detained by the government of the place, this was such a casualty as came within the exception of " dangers of the seas," in the condition of an embargo bond, dated 29th December, 1807, taken in pursuance of the act of Congress of December 22, 1807. United States v. Hall and Worth, 6 Cranch, 176 ; 2 Cond. Rep. 340.
Subsequent to the execution of this bond, on the 9th of January, 1808, Congress passed a supplement to the embargo law, by which other and additional penalties were imposed , and the circumstances under which the obligor in any embargo bond given under the act of 22d December, 1807, could obtain relief, were changed. The court said they would never consider the latter act as applying to previous facts, unless such construction should be unavoidable. Ibid.
In an action of debt for the penalty of an embargo bond, it is a good plea under the act of Congress of
12th March, 1808, sec. 3, that the party was prevented relanding the goods in the United States by unavoidable accidents. Durousseau v. The United States, 6 Cranch, 307 ; 2 Cond. Rep. 380.
It was no offence under the embargo laws, to take goods out of one vessel and put them in another in the port of Baltimore ; unless it was with an intention to export them. 6 Cranch, 327.
The evidence of the necessity which will excuse a violation of the embargo laws, must be clear and
certain. Brig James Wells v. The United States, 7 Cranch, 22 ; 2 Cond . Rep. 402. The departure of a vessel from a wharf in a port, and proceeding a mile and an half therefrom, with
the intention of proceeding to sea, is not a departure from the port within the meaning of the supple-
mentary embargo act of January 9, 1808 , if the vessel had not actually gone out of the port before seizure. Sloop Active v. The United States, 7 Cranch, 100 ; 2 Cond. Rep. 431.
A vessel which has proceeded to a foreign port, contrary to the embargo act of January 8, 1808, is

hereby is laid on all ships and vessels in the ports and places within the limits or jurisdiction of the United States, cleared or not cleared , bound

the President be authorized to give such instructions to the officers of the revenue, and of the navy and revenue cutters of the United States, as shall appear best adapted for carrying the same into full effect : Provided, that nothing herein contained shall be construed to prevent the departure of any foreign ship or vessel, either in ballast, or with the goods, wares and merchandise on board of such foreign ship or vessel, when notified of this act.

liable to be seized on her return , although that act gives a penalty ofdouble her value, in case she should not be seized. United States v. The brig Eliza, 7 Cranch, 13 ; 2 Cond. Rep. 437.
A merchant vessel captured as prize, condemned and sold, and afterwards purchased by her former master, a citizen of the United States, who obtained a Danish burgher's brief, and who cleared out of a port of the United States as a Dane, is a foreign ship within the fifth section of the act of January 9, 1808, supplementary to the embargo act, although the purchaser was yet a citizen of the United States. The schooner Good Catherine v. The United States, 7 Cranch, 349 ; 2 Cond. Rep. 525.
By the 11th section of the act of April 25, 1808, the collector had no right to detain a vessel and her cargo, after her arrival at her port of destination, under a suspicion that she intended to violate the embargo, and such suspicions could not be justified by instructions from the Secretary of the Treasury nor the confirmation of the President. Otis v. Bacon , 7 Cranch, 589 ; 2 Cond. Rep. 618.
Under the 11th section of the embargo act of April 25, 1808, the collector was justified in detaining a vessel by his honest opinion that there was an intention to violate or evade the provisions of the embargo laws. It was not necessary for him to show that his suspicions were reasonable. Crowell et al. v. M'Faddon, 8 Cranch, 94 ; 3 Cond. Rep. 48.
A bond taken under the first section of the embargo act of January 9, 1808, is not void , although taken by consent of the parties, after the vessel had sailed. Speake et al. v. The United States, 9 Cranch, 28 ; 3 Cond. Rep. 244.
The obligors are estopped to deny that the penalty of the bond is double the true value of the cargo. Ibid.
Under the third section of the embargo act of April 25, 1808, a vessel is not subject to forfeiture, for departing without a clearance, unless she has departed out of port. The Active v. The United States, 7 Cranch, 100 ; 2 Cond . Rep . 431.
It seems to be a good defence to an action on an embargo bond, that the same was given for more than twice the value of the cargo, and that the obligors were constrained to execute it by the refusal of a clearance. United States v. Gordon et al. , 7 Cranch, 287 ; 2 Cond. Rep. 494.
If the collector justify a detention under the embargo law of April 25 , 1808 , sec. 11 , he need not show that his opinion was correct, nor that he used reasonable diligence in ascertaining the facts on which his opinion was founded. Otis v. Watkins, 9 Cranch, 339 ; 3 Cond. Rep. 424. See Slocum v. Mayberry, 2 Wheat. 1 ; 4 Cond . Rep. 1 ; Otis v. Walter, 2 Wheat. 18 ; 4 Cond. Rep. 10.
Under the embargo act of December 22 , 1807 , the words, " an embargo shall be laid," not only imposed upon the public officers the duty of preventing the departure of registered or sea- lettered vessels on a foreign voyage, but consequently rendered them liable to forfeiture under the supplementary act of January 9, 1808. In such a case, if the vessel be actually and bona fide carried by force to a foreign port, she is not liable. The William King, 2 Wheat. 148 ; 4 Cond. Rep. 71.
Under the embargo act of April 25, 1808, a vessel not arriving at her port of original destination , excites an honest suspicion in the collector, that a demand of a permit to land a cargo, was merely colourable ; this is not a termination of the voyage, so as to preclude the right of detention. Otis v. Walter, 11 Wheat. 192 ; 6 Cond. Rep. 270.
Under the 5th section ofthe embargo act of January 9, 1808, " a foreign vessel," means a vessel navi. gating under the flag of a foreign power ; and not a vessel owned in whole or in part by foreigners, domicilled in the United States. The Sally, 1 Gallis. C. C. R. 58.
A departure from any place within the jurisdictional limits of the United States, although such place be not within any port, is within the embargo act of December 22, 1807. The Ann, 1 Gallis. C. , R. 62.
A vessel, which during the existence ofthe embargo laws, departed from one port ofthe United States to another, but was obliged from irresistible necessity, to put into a foreign port, and sell her cargo, was not guilty of a violation of the embargo laws. The Brig William Gray, Paine's C. C. R. 16.
The embargo law was passed December 22, 1807. A vessel cleared for St. Mary's, Georgia, on the 15th of January ; the collector received information of the passage of the law, and gave notice of it. It did not appear that this was known to the master or owners previous to the sailing. Being seized for a violation of the law, the court ordered her restitution. The Cotton Planter, 1 Paine's C. C. R. 23.
To excuse a vessel which has sailed under an embargo bond, from re-landing her cargo in the United States, under this clause, " the perils of the sea only excepted ," the accident must happen without any fault or negligence of the master, and must occur at sea ; or if at land, it must be the immediate consequence of the peril happening at sea. United States v. Hall et al. , 2 Wash. C. C. R. 366. See the United States v. The Nancy, 3 Wash. C. C. R. 281. The United States v. Morgan et al. , 3 Wash. C. C. R. 10. The United States v.

The third section of the embargo act of December 22, 1807, was not repealed by the act of 1809. The Argo, 2 Gallis. C. C. R. 314.

RESOLUTIONS .

Resolution in I. RESOLVED by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United

relation to the States of America in Congress assembled, That the expressions contained

conduct of F. J. Jackson, minis.

in the official letter of Francis J. Jackson , minister plenipotentiary of

ter plenipoten his Britannic majesty near the United States, dated the 23d day of Octo-

tBirairtyaifnr.om Great ber, 1809, and addressed to Mr. Smith, Secretary of State, conveying the idea that the executive government ofthe United States had a know-

ledge, that the arrangement lately made by Mr. Erskine , his predecessor,

in behalf of his government, with the government of the United States,

was entered into without competent powers on the part of Mr. Erskine

for that purpose, were highly indecorous and insolent : That the repetition of the same intimation in his official letter dated the 4th of No-

vember, 1809, after he was apprised by the asseveration of the Secretary of State, that the executive government had no such knowledge, and that if it had possessed such knowledge, such arrangement would not have been entered into on the part of the United States ; and after also being officially apprised , that such intimation was inadmissible, was still more insolent and affronting ; and that in refusing to receive any further communications from him, in consequence ofthese outrageous and pre-

meditated insults, the executive government has manifested a just regard to its own dignity and honour, as well as to the character and interest of the American people : That the letter , signed Francis J. Jackson, headed " Circular," dated 13th November, 1809, and published and circulated through the country, is a still more direct and aggravated insult and affront to the American people and their government, as it is evidently

an insidious attempt to excite their resentments and distrusts against their own government, by appealing to them, through false or fallacious disguises, against some of its acts ; and to excite resentments and divisions amongst the people, themselves, which can only be dishonourable to their own characters and ruinous to their own interests : And the

Congress of the United States do hereby solemnly pledge themselves to the American people, and to the world, to stand by and support the executive government in its refusal to receive any further communications from the said Francis J. Jackson , and to call into action the whole force of the nation , if it should become necessary, in consequence of the

conduct of the executive government in this respect, to repel such

insults, and to assert and maintain the rights, the honour and the interests of the United States.

(a) The decisions of the Courts of the United States upon the law of Bail have been : Bail in Criminal Cases.-The circuit court has no authority to issue a habeas corpus for the purpose of
surrendering a principal in discharge of his bail, when the principal is confined in jail merely under the process of a state court ; nor will the court discharge the bail of such party, who has become bound by recognizance in the circuit court to answer, &c. , merely on account of such impediment ; but, in their discretion, the court will respite the recognizance. U. S. v. Jonathan French, 1 Gallis. C. C. R. 1 .
The mere continuance of a cause , on sufficient grounds exhibited by the district attorney, constitutes no reason why the court should admit a defendant who is in confinement, to bail. But if the court is satisfied that the health of the accused is such as that his life will be endangered by his being kept in confinement until next term , it furnishes a strong ground for bail. The U. S. v. Jones, 3 Wash. C. C. R. 209.
Probable cause, on oath, must be stated, to justify the holding a defendant to bail under the 3d sec. ofthe act of Congress of 26th Feb. 1795, ch. 31. Leonard v. Caskin, Bee's Adm. Decis. 146.
Aaron Burr, charged with carrying on a military expedition against a nation with whom the United States were at peace, was admitted to bail. 1 Burr's Trial, 18.
The postponement of a criminal case, on the application ofthe defendant, to allow him an opportunity to obtain testimony, is not a cause of bail. The U. S. v. Stewart. C. C. U. S. of Pennsylvania, 2 Dal. 345 .
The circumstances must be very strong, which will, at any time, induce the court to admit a person to bail who stands charged with high treason. Ibid.
The supreme court of the United States has jurisdiction , under the constitution and laws of the United States, to bail a person committed for trial on a criminal charge, by a district judge of the United States. U. S. v. Hamilton , 3 Dall . 13.
The marshal of the United States ofthe Connecticut district, upon a writ of attachment sued out by the United States, to recover a penalty, may commit a defendant to prison for want of bail, without a mitti. mus from a state magistrate, as is required by the local laws of the state ; for such municipal regulation does not bind the officers ofthe United States. Palmer v. Allen, 7 Cranch, 560 ; 2 Cond. Rep. 607.
Bail in Civil Cases.-The bail is fixed by the death of the principal, after the return of a capias ad satisfaciendum, and before the return of the scire facias ; and the bail is not entitled to an exoneretur in such a case. Davidson v. Taylor, 12 Wheat. 604 ; 6 Cond. Rep. 660.
Demanding excessive bail, where the plaintiff has a good cause of action, or holding to bail where there is no cause of action, if done vexatiously, entitles the party injured to an action for a malicious prosecution. If bail be not demanded, no such action will lie. Ray v. Law, Peters' C. C. R. 207.
Pennsylvania. The circuit court will discharge, on common bail, a defendant who has been arrested for a debt contracted in the state in which he has, subsequent to the commencement of the suit, been discharged by the insolvent laws ofthe state. Read v. Chapman, Peters' C. C. R. 404.
Pennsylvania. Where a capias has been issued against a person who has been discharged from the debt for which it was issued , by the insolvent laws of the state in which it was contracted, the court will not quash the writ, but will discharge the defendant on common bail. Ibid.
On a rule to show cause why the defendant should not be discharged on common bail, he having been discharged under the insolvent laws of Pennsylvania ; evidence to show that the discharge had been fraudulently obtained , cannot be given. Campbell et al . v. Claudius, Peters' C. C. R. 484.
Pennsylvania. Where the debt has been contracted and made payable out of the state, the circuit court will not discharge, on common bail, a defendant arrested for such debt, notwithstanding his discharge by the insolvent laws of the state in which the action was brought. Ibid.
After bail given, and plea pleaded, the defendant cannot arrest the judgment on the ground of a misnomer. Scull v. Briddle, 2 Wash. C. C. R. 200.
The proceedings were amended by the recognizance of bail , and the name of the defendant in the recognizance was inserted in the declaration. Ibid.
The court are not precluded from obtaining further satisfaction as to the debt sworn to in an affidavit to

circuit court of the United States, to be holden in any district in which the present provision , by law, for taking bail and affidavits in civil causes, (in cases where such affidavits are, by law, admissible) is inadequate, or on account of the extent of such district, inconvenient, to appoint such

hold to bail, because the affidavit is positive ; but the necessity to examine the party who makes the affidavit, must be presented on the face of the same. Oliver v. Parish, 2 Wash. C. C. R. 462.
New York. Under the act of Congress of 6th January, 1800, the sheriff of a county is bound to take a bond for the limits , as provided by the state laws, from a prisoner confined on process from the courts of the United States ; and false imprisonment would lie on his refusal. United States v. Noah, Paine's C. C. R. 368.
New York. Such a bond has , in all respects, the same incidents, and the like legal effects with a bond taken under the state laws. Ibid.
New York. It is assignable : and an assignment discharges the sheriff from a liability for a subsequent escape. Ibid.
New York. The United States are expressly named in the act, and bound by it ; and an assignment of a bond to them when they are plaintiffs, is valid. Ibid.
New York. The Secretary of the Treasury having accepted such an assignment, the court presumed that he was authorized, and held the plaintiffs bound by his acceptance. Ibid.
New York. The term " process," in the act, includes executions, as well as mesne process. Ibid. New York. After a prisoner has been enlarged upon a limit bond, the sheriff can confine him again only on the bail's becoming insufficient. He cannot accept a surrender of him ; certainly not after an assignment of the bond. Ibid.
Pennsylvania. The bail to the sheriff entered special bail ; on being excepted to, he refused to justify, whereupon he was sued on the bail bond, and he surrendered the principal before the return of the writ. Held , that the surrender was good, and the bail was entitled to relief on the usual terms. Stockton v. Throgmorton, 1 Baldwin's C. C. R. 148.
No justification of bail is necessary, when special bail is entered for the purpose of a surrender. Ibid. Bail may take the principal on a Sunday, or in another state. Johnson v. Tomkins, 1 Baldwin's C. C. R. 577.
If the defendant be discharged under an insolvent law of the state where the contract is made, after
the bail bond has been assigned to the plaintiff, the court will not order an exoneretur to be entered on the bail piece. Bosbyshell v. Oppenheimer, 4 Wash. C. C. R. 317.
By the Pennsylvania practice, filing the declaration before the return of the writ, is not a waiver ofthe bail. The English rule is otherwise, unless the declaration be filed de bene esse. Ibid.
The undertaking of the appearance bail can be no otherwise fulfilled, than by the defendant giving special bail, if so ruled ; and that bail justifying, if excepted to. Ibid.
If, instead of ruling the marshal to bring in the body of the defendant, the plaintiff accept an assign. ment of the bail bond, and bring a suit thereon , still the court will not fix the appearance bail, if certain terms are complied with ; one of which is the defendant's entering special bail. Ibid.
On a rule on the plaintiff to show his cause of action, who thereupon filed a positive affidavit of the debt, the court will not order the party making the affidavit, to be examined on oath in court ; no ground appearing to the court to justify a suspicion that the debt was not due. Champion v. Ross, 4 Wash. C. C. R. 325.
The court will not relieve the appearance bail, upon his delivering the principal in court, unless he put in and perfect special bail. Bosbyshell v. Oppenheimer, 4 Wash. C. C. R. 317.
Although the special bail may deliver up the principal at any time before the second scire facias, it does not follow that the appearance bail may do it. Their engagements are of a different nature. Ibid.
Where the defendant is discharged under the insolvent law of the state where the debt was contracted, and has given special bail, the court will order an exoneretur to be entered on the bail piece. Richardson v. McIntyre, 4 Wash. C. C. R. 412.
If the special bail surrender the principal, who has been discharged under an insolvent law, the court will discharge the principal from custody. Ibid.
Under the act of assembly of Virginia, the defendant may enter special bail , and defend the suit at any time before the entering up of judgment, upon a writ of inquiry executed ; and the appearance of the defendant, or the entry of special bail, before such judgment, discharges the appearance bail. Bartle v. Coleman, 6 Wheat. 475 ; 5 Cond. Rep. 142.
If the defendant does not appear, or give special bail, the appearance bail may defend the suit, and is liable to the same judgment as the defendant would have been liable to ; but the defendant cannot appear
and consent to a reference, the report and judgment on which is to bind the appearance bail as well as himself. Such a joint judgment is erroneous, and will be reversed as to both. Ibid.
District of Columbia. The bail is fixed by the death of the principal after the return of the ca. sa. and before the return of the scire facias ; and the bail is not entitled to an exoneretur in such a case. Davidson v. Taylor, 12 Wheat. 604 ; 6 Cond. Rep. 660.
Ohio. The recognizance of special bail being a part of the proceedings in a suit, and subject to the regulation of the court, the nature , extent, and limitations of the responsibility created thereby, are to be decided, not by a mere examination of the terms of the instrument, but by a reference to the known rules of the court, and the principles of law applicable thereto. Whatever, in the sense of these rules and principles, will constitute a discharge of the liability of the special bail , must be deemed included within the purview of the instrument, as much as if it were expressly stated. Beers et al. v. Haughton, 9 Peters, 329.
By the rules of the circuit court of Ohio, adopted as early as January, 1808, the liability of special bail was provided for and limited ; and it was declared, that special bail may surrender their principal at any time before or after judgment against the principal, provided such surrender shall be before a return of a scire facias executed, or a second scire facias returned " nihil " against the bail. And this, in fact, constituted a part of the law of Ohio, at the time the present recognizance was given ; the same having been so enacted by the legislature. This act of the legislature of Ohio, was in force at the time of the passage of the act of Congress of the 19th of May, 1828 , regulating the process of the courts of the

and so many discreet persons, in different parts of the district, as such court shall deem necessary, to take acknowledgments of bail and affida vits ; which acknowledgments of bail and affidavits shall have the like force and effect as if taken before any judge of said court ; and any per

United States, in the new states ; and must therefore be deemed as a part of the " modes of proceeding in suits," and to have been adopted by it : so that the surrender of the principal within the time thus prescribed, is not a mere matter of favour of the court, but is strictly a matter of legal right. Ibid.
It is not strictly true, that on the return of " non est inventus " to a capias ad satisfaciendum against the principal, the bail is " fixed," in courts acting professedly under the common law, and independently of statute. So much are the proceedings against bail deemed a matter subject to the regulation and practice of the court, that the court will not hesitate to relieve them in a summary manner, and direct an exoneretur to be entered in cases by the indulgence of the court, by giving them time to render the principal until the appearance day of the last scire facias against them, as in cases of strict right. Ibid.
When bail is entitled to be discharged, ex debito justiti, they may not only apply for an exoneretur by way of summary proceeding, but they may plead the matter as a bar to the suit, in their defence. But
when the discharge is matter of indulgence only, the application is to the discretion of the court ; and an exoneretur cannot be insisted on, except by way of motion. Ibid.
When the party is, by the practice of the court, entitled to an exoneretur without a positive surrender of the principal, according to the terms of the recognizance ; he is, a fortiori, entitled to insist on it by way of defence, when he is entitled , ex debito justiti, to surrender the principal. Ibid.
The doctrine is fully established, that where the principal would be clearly entitled to an immediate and unconditional discharge, if he had been surrendered, there the bail are entitled to relief by entering an exoneretur without any surrender. And, a fortiori, this doctrine will apply, when the law prohibits the party from being imprisoned at all, and where by the positive operation of law the surrender is prevented. Ibid.
Where the defendants in a judgment are not liable to be imprisoned , having been released under the insolvent laws of a state, the special bail is not bound to surrender them in his discharge. Beers et al. v. Haughton, 1 M'Lean's C. C. R. 231.
To an action on the recognizance of bail, he may plead the discharge of his principal. Ibid. To hold to bail under the statute of Illinois, the affidavit must state more than the belief of the assent, or the legal import of the action on which it is founded. Wright et al . v. Cayswell, 1 M'Lean's C. C. R. 471 .
The act of 20th February, 1839, which adopted the state laws, in regard to imprisonment of debtors, took immediate effect, as well in suits pending, as in other cases. Gray, Sherwood & Co. v. Monroe et al., 1 M'Lean's C. C. R. 528.
The law relates to the remedy, and under it, when appearance bail has been given, the defendant may, on motion, be discharged on common bail . Ibid.
Bail in Admiralty, and in Prize Causes.-Where the court of admiralty has parted with the possession of the property upon bail or stipulation , and it is necessary for the purposes of justice to retake the property into the custody of the court, the proper process against any person not a party to the stipulation, but who is alleged to have the actual or constructive possession , is a monition, and not an execution in the first instance. The Gran Para, 10 Wheat. 497 ; 6 Cond. Rep. 199.
Wherever a stipulation is taken in an admiralty suit for property subjected to legal process and condemnation, the stipulation is deemed a mere substitute for the thing itself; and the stipulators are liable to the exercise of all those authorities on the part of the court, which it could properly exercise if the thing was in custody. The Palmyra, 12 Wheat. 1 ; 6 Cond. Rep . 397.
Regularly there should be no delivery of prize property on bail, until after a hearing of the cause, and in most cases a sale is preferable to an appraisement. The George, 2 Gallis. C. C. R. 249.
Proceedings by libel were instituted upon a seizure of goods, and a bond given for their appraised value on the delivery of the goods to the claimant. Afterwards the libel was by amendment changed to an in-formation, and the goods were condemned. On an application for an attachment against the obligors in the bond, it was held that although the case was not regularly within the 89th section of the collection law, yet a compliance with the stipulations in the bond might be enforced by attachment against the obligors. United States v. Four Part Pieces of Woollen Cloth, 1 Paine, 435.
And the court held that it made no difference that the obligors were only sureties, and had not themselves received the goods. Ibid.
If the claimant is not a party on the bond, all the obligors are to be deemed principals. Ibid. The bond was taken in the district court of New York, and under the statute dividing the district, the proceedings were transferred to the district court of the northern district, and by a subsequent statute to this court, where the condemnation took place. The condition of the bond was to pay the appraised value of the goods into the district court, if they should be condemned in that court. Held, that a condemnation in this court had the same effect to forfeit the bond. Ibid.
In prize causes, before a hearing, the property is never delivered on bail, unless by consent. If it is perishable, the proper remedy is by an appraisement and sale ; and in like manner the court will decree a sale, pending the proceedings, for any other justifiable cause. After a hearing, the property may, in the discretion of the court, be delivered on bail. In cases ordered for further proof, a delivery on bail is sometimes allowed, to the claimants ; and if they decline, to the captors. But it is a proceeding adopted with extreme caution, as it opens a door to many inconveniences, and sometimes to frauds. In no case should a delivery on bail take place, until the court is fully satisfied that the appraisement is perfectly fair, and the property estimated at its full value. The ship Euphrates, 1 Gallis . C. C. R. 451 .
Where, on the hearing, the property is acquitted , and an appeal is interposed to a tribunal not sitting within the same jurisdiction ; or into which the property does not follow the cause, (as an appeal to the supreme court of the United States, ) the claimants are generally allowed a delivery of the property, or in a case of sale of the proceeds on bail. Where there is a decree of condemnation, the same rule is generally adopted, as to the captors. But it is always an application to the sound discretion of the court ; and

if there be danger of injustice, the court will withhold it from either party, and content itselfwith retaining the property, or with ordering a sale thereof, and a deposit of the proceeds in the registry. Ibid. 452.
If a bond, taken on the delivery of property on bail , be void, as not conforming to law, the court will enforce a re- delivery of the property by attachment. The Struggle, 1 Gallis. C. C. R. 476.
A bond voluntarily given upon the delivery of property on bail, on application of the claimant, is good ; although the condition does not exactly conform to the act of Congress, under which it may have been intended to take it. Ibid.
The act of Congress of 2d March, 1799, chap. 22, is not understood as compulsory on the court as to the delivery on bail. It still rests in the discretion of the court. Ibid. 477.
The district courts of the United States have no authority, after an appeal, to bail or sell property. The Grotius, 1 Gallis. C. C. R. 503.
Whether the security for property, delivered on bail, be by bond or stipulation, is immaterial . On such security, a summary judgment may be entered for the appraised value , and for the costs. The Alligator, 1 Gallis. C. C. R. 145.
The district court, by virtue of its general admiralty jurisdiction , may deliver property on bail ; and the form in which the security is taken is immaterial : on such security a summary judgment may be rendered to the appraised value. The Lively, 1 Gallis. C. C. R. 315.
It is the duty of commissioners to whom it is referred to estimate damages, to make their report as specific as the nature of the thing will admit ; so that not only the result, but the detail of their judgment should appear. Ibid.
In cases of restitution with damages, in prize proceedings, if in order to ascertain the damages, an inspection or a sale of the cargo be, in the judgment of the commissioner or the parties, necessary ; application should be made to the court for an order of unlivery and appraisement, or for a sale, as the case may require. Ibid.
No delivery of property on bail, in a prize cause, can be made legally, where the United States are parties, without due notice to the district attorney. Ex parte Robbins , 2 Gallis. C. C. R. 320.
If the cargo is liable to deteriorate or perish, or the ship to be injured by the delay incident to the salvage proceedings, the proper course is to apply to the court for a sale thereof. It is not a matter of right
of either party to have a delivery on bail in such cases. The Ship Nathaniel Hooper, 3 Sumner's C. C. R. 542.

STATUTE I.

CHAP. L.-An Act for the admission of the State of Louisiana into the Union, April 8, 1812.

and to extend the laws of the United States to the said state.(a)

Act of Feb.

WHEREAS , the representatives of the people of all that part of the ter- 15A, c18t11o, fchM. 2a1y. ritory or country ceded, under the name of " Louisiana," by the treaty 22, 1812, ch. 93.

(a) The decisions of the Supreme Court on the extension of the laws of the United States to Louisiana, and the practice of the courts of the United States in the district of Louisiana, have been :-
As, by the laws of Louisiana, questions of fact in civil cases are tried by the court, unless either ofthe parties demand a jury, in an action of debt on a judgment, the interest on the original judgment may be computed, and make part of the judgment in Louisiana, without a writ of inquiry, and the intervention of a jury. Mayhew v. Thatcher, 6 Wheat. 129 ; 5 Cond. Rep. 34.
By the treaty by which Louisiana was acquired , the United States stipulated that the inhabitants ofthe ceded territories should be protected in the free enjoyment of their property. The United States, as a just nation, regard this stipulation as the avowal of a principle which would have been held equally sacred , although it had not been inserted in the treaty. Soulard et al. v. The United States , 4 Peters, 511.
The term property, as applied to lands, comprehends every species of title, inchoate or complete. It is supposed to embrace those rights which lie in contract ; those which are executory , as well as those which are executed. In this respect, the relation of the inhabitants of Louisiana to their government, is not changed. The new government takes the place of that which is passed away. Ibid.
By the provisions of the acts of Congress, Louisiana, when she came into the Union, had organized therein a district court of the United States, having the same jurisdiction , except as to appeals and writs of error, as the circuit courts of the United States in other states ; and the modes of proceeding in that court, were required to be according to the principles, rules, and usages which belong to courts of equity, as contradistinguished from courts of common law. And whether there were or not, in the several states,
courts of equity proceeding according to such principles and usages, made no difference, according to the construction uniformly given by the supreme court. Livingston v. Story, 9 Peters , 632.
The provisions of the act of Congress of 1824, relative to the practice of the courts of the United States in Louisiana, contain the descriptive term civil actions, which embrace cases at law and in equity ; and may be fairly construed as used in contradistinction to criminal causes. They apply equally to cases in equity ; and if there are any laws in Louisiana directing the mode of proceeding in equity causes, they are adopted by that act, and will govern the practice in the courts of the United States. Ibid.
Under the law of Louisiana, there are two kinds of pledges, the pawn and the antichresis. A thing is said to be pawned , when a movable is given as a security ; the antichresis consists of immovables. Livingston v. Story, 11 Peters , 351 .

made at Paris, on the thirtieth day of April , one thousand eight hundred and three, between the United States and France, contained within the following limits, that is to say : beginning at the mouth of the river Sabine ; thence, by a line to be drawn along the middle of said river, including all islands to the thirty-second degree of latitude ; thence, due north, to the northernmost part of the thirty-third degree of north latitude ; thence, along the said parallel of latitude, to the river Mississippi ; thence, down the said river, to the river Iberville ; and from thence, along the middle of the said river, and lakes Maurepas and Ponchartrain, to the gulf of Mexico ; thence, bounded by the said gulf, to the place of beginning, including all islands within three leagues of the coast ; did, on the twenty-second day of January, one thousand eight hundred and twelve, form for themselves a constitution and state government, and give to the said state the name of the state of Louisiana, in pursuance of an act of Congress, entituled "An act to enable the people of the territory of Orleans to form a constitution and state government, and for the admission of the said state into the Union, on an equal footing with the original states, and for other purposes :" And the

a sum of money paid to him , and took from them a counter - letter, signed by them ; by which it was agreed, that on the payment of a sum stated in it, on a day stated, the property should be recon. veyed by them to L.; and if not so paid, the property should be sold by an auctioneer ; and, after repaying, out of the proceeds, the sum mentioned in the counter-letter, the balance should be paid to L. The money was not paid on the day appointed, and a further time was given for its payment, with additional interest and charges ; and if not paid at the expiration of the time, it should be sold by an auctioneer. An agreement was at the same time made by L., that the counter-letter should be delivered up to F. and S., and cancelled . The money not being paid, it was again agreed between the parties, that if on a subsequent day fixed upon , it should not, with an additional amount for interest, &c. , be paid, the property should belong absolutely to F. and S. The money was not paid, and F. and S. afterwards held the property as their own. The supreme court held this transaction to be an antichresis, according to the civil code of Louisiana and on a bill filed in the district court of the United States, for the eastern district of Louisiana , in 1832 , decreed that the rents and profits of the estate should be accounted for by S., who had become the sole owner of the property by purchase of F.'s moiety, and that the property should be sold by an auctioneer, unless the balance due S. , after charging the sum due at the time last agreed upon for the payment of the money, and legal interest, with all the expenses of the estate , deducting the rents and profits, should be paid to S.; and on payment of the balance due S. , the residue should be paid to the legal representative of L. Ibid.
The antichresis must be reduced to writing. The creditor acquires by this contract, the right of reaping the fruits, or other rewards of the immovables given to him in pledge, on condition of deducting, annually, their proceeds from the interest, if any be due to him, and afterwards from the principal of his debt. The creditor is bound , unless the contrary is agreed on , to pay the taxes, as well as the annual charges of the property given to him in pledge. He is likewise bound, under the penalty of damages, to provide for the keeping and necessary repairs of the pledged estate ; and may lay out, from the revenues of the estate, sufficient for such expenses. Ibid.
The creditor does not become proprietor of the pledged immovables, by the failure of payment at the stated time ; any clause to the contrary is null : and in that case , it is only lawful for him to sue his debtor before the court, in order to obtain a sentence against him, and to cause the objects which have been put into his bands , to be seized and sold. Ibid.
The debtor cannot, before the full payment of his debt, claim the enjoyment of the immovables which he has given in pledge ; but the creditor, who wishes to free himself from the obligations under the antichresis, may always , unless he has renounced this right, compel the debtor to retake the enjoyment of his immovables. Ibid.
The doctrine of prescription, under the civil law, does not apply to this case, which is one of pledge ; and if it does, the time before the institution of this suit had not elapsed, in which, by the law of Louisiana, a person may sue for immovable property. Ibid.
By the contract of antichresis, the possession of the property is transferred to the person advancing the money. In case of failure to pay, the property is to be sold by judicial process ; and the sum which it may bring, over the amount for which it was pledged , is to be paid to the person making the pledge. Ibid.
If any rule has been made by the district court of Louisiana, abolishing chancery practice in that court, it is a violation of those rules which the supreme court of the United States has passed to regulate the courts of equity of the United States. Those rules are as obligatory on the courts of the United States in Louisiana, as they are upon all other courts of the United States ; and the only modifications or additions which can be made by the circuit or district courts, are such as shall not be inconsistent with the
rules prescribed. When the rules prescribed by the supreme court do not apply, the practice of the circuit and district courts shall be regulated by the practice ofthe high court of chancery in England. Story v. Livingston, 13 Peters , 359.
The supreme court has said, upon more than one occasion, after mature deliberation upon able arguments of distinguished counsel against it, that the courts ofthe United States in Louisiana, possess equity powers under the constitution and laws of the United States. That if there are any laws in Louisiana, directing the mode of procedure in equity causes, they are adopted by the act of 26th May, 1829 ; and will govern the practice in the courts of the United States. But if there are no laws regulating the prac-
tice in any equity causes, the rules of chancery practice in Louisiana, mean the rules prescribed by the supreme court, for the government of the courts of the United States, under the act of Congress of May 8, 1792, chap. 36, sec . 2. Ibid.

The President is the sole and exclusive judge whether the exigency has arisen, in which he is authorized to call out the militia. Ibid.
Where a party justifies, in an action against him, under the orders of the President calling out the militia, it is not necessary that he should aver in his pleadings, that the exigency had actually occurred ; it is sufficient that the President has so decided , and has issued his orders ; and if the fact of the exist ence ofthe exigency were averred, it might be traversed. Ibid.
Nor is it necessary to set forth the orders of the President at large ; it is sufficient to state that the call made by the governor of the state was in obedience to the orders of the President. Ibid.
A requisition from the President upon the governor, is an order, in legal intendment. Ibid. A militia man who refuses to obey the order of the President, calling him into public service, is liable to be tried for the offence, under the 5th section of the act of 1795. Ibid.
The 64th of the rules and articles of war, enacted by the act of April 10, 1806, chap. 20, which provides that general courts martial may consist of any number of commissioned officers, from five to thirteen inclusively, but they shall not consist of less than thirteen where that number can be convened without manifest injury to the service, being in a matter submitted to his sound discretion, is conclusive. Ibid.
This article, however, is not obligatory in cases where the court martial is convened to try militia. men who have neglected to obey the orders of the President, calling them into public service. Ibid.
Where there is no positive statutory regulation as to the number of persons of whom the court is to be constituted, reference must be had to the general usage of the military service, or what may be called the customary military law. Ibid.
Courts martial, when duly organized , are bound to execute their duties, and regulate their modes of proceeding by this customary military law in the absence of positive enactment. Ibid.
In a case out of the operation of the articles of war, the sentence of a court martial, which has been
approved by the President, is sufficiently approved. Ibid. A court martial regularly called under the act of 1795, does not expire with the termination of the
war then existing ; nor is its jurisdiction to try offences in any way dependent upon the fact of war or peace. Ibid.
Where, in an action of replevin, the defendant being a deputy marshal of the United States , avowed and justified the taking of the plaintiff's goods, by virtue of a warrant issued to the marshal of the district, to collect a fine imposed by the judgment of a court martial, described as a general court martial,
composed of officers of the militia of the state of New York, in the service of the United States, (six in number, and naming them ,) duly organized and convened by general orders issued pursuant to the act of Congress of February 28, 1795, chap. 36, for the trial of those of the militia of the state of New York, ordered into the service ofthe United States, in the third military district, who had refused to rendezvous and enter into the service of the United States, in obedience to the order of the commander in chief of the state of New York, of the 4th and 29th of August, 1814, issued in compliance with the requisition of the President, made in pursuance of the same act of Congress ; and alleging that the plaintiff being a
private in the militia , neglected and refused to rendezvous, &c.; and was regularly tried by the said general court martial , and duly convicted of the said delinquency : Held, that the avowry was good. Ibid.
Alien enemies, who had enrolled themselves as volunteers, and been accepted by the President , under the act of February 6th, 1812, chap. 21 , are not entitled to a discharge on the ground of such alienage ; there being no law enjoining the President from accepting their services.

It seems that the President had a right to accept volunteers to serve at a particular post, as well as for general service ; the act being silent on the subject : at any rate, he had a discretion on the subject, not to be controlled by a court of justice. Ibid.
The insertion in the enrolment, of the officer's name, under whom the volunteers were to serve, was meant merely to ascertain the post where they were to serve , by designating its commander ; and not to attach them to his personal command, so that he could not be changed. Ibid.

April 25, 1812.
Act of April 18, 1814, ch. 85.
Act ofMay 8, 1822, ch. 128.

(a) On the 12th February, 1813, Congress passed an " act authorizing the President of the United States to take possession of a tract of country lying south of the Mississippi territory, and west of the river Perdido." This act was not promulgated until the publication of the " Session acts " of the first session ofthe fifteenth Congress, which terminated April 20 , 1818. See " resolution and acts relative to the occupation of Florida by the United States," Appendix to the acts of the first session of the fifteenth Congress, 1818, Vol. 3, p. 472.

Upon the titles to lands in this country, the following decisions have been made by the Supreme Court:-

By the treaty of St. Ildefonso, made on the 1st of October, 1800, Spain ceded Louisiana to France ; and France, by the treaty of Paris, signed the 30th of April, 1803, ceded it to the United States. Under this treaty, the United States claimed the countries between the Iberville and the Perdido. Spain con-

tended that her cession to France comprehended only that territory which at the time of the cession was denominated Louisiana, consisting of the island of New Orleans, and the country which had been originally ceded to her by France, west of the Mississippi . The land claimed by the plaintiffs in error, under a grant from the crown of Spain, made after the treaty of St. Ildefonso , lies within the disputed territory ; and this case presents the question, to whom did the country between the Iberville and Perdido belong after the treaty of St. Ildefonso ? Had France and Spain agreed upon the boundaries of the retroceded territory before Louisiana was acquired by the United States ; that agreement would undoubtedly have ascertained its limits. But the declarations of France, made after parting with the province, cannot be admitted as conclusive. In questions of this character, political considerations have too much influence over the conduct of nations, to permit their declarations to decide the course of an independent government, in a matter vitally interesting to itself. Foster et al. v. Neilson , 2 Pters, 306.
If a Spanish grantee had obtained possession of the land in dispute so as to be the defendant, would a court of the United States maintain his title under a Spanish grant, made subsequent to the acquisition of Louisiana, singly on the principle that the Spanish construction of the treaty of St. Ildefonso was right, and the American construction wrong ? Such a decision would subvert those principles which govern the relations between the legislative and judicial departments, and mark the limits of each. Ibid. 309.

The sound construction of the 8th article of the treaty between the United States and Spain, of the 22d of February, 1829, will not enable the court to apply its provisions to the case of the plaintiff. Ibid. 314.
The article does not declare that all the grants made by his Catholic Majesty before the 24th January, 1818, shall be valid to the same extent as if the ceded territories had remained under his dominion. It

does not say that those grants are hereby confirmed. Had such been its language, it would have acted

directly on the subject, and it would have repealed those acts of Congress which were repugnant to it;

but its language is, that those grants shall be ratified and confirmed to the persons in possession , &c.

By whom shall they be ratified and confirmed ? This seems to be the language of contract ; and if it is,

the ratification and confirmation which are promised must be the act of the legislature. Until such act

Congress, in order to guard against imposition , declared, by the law of 1804, that all grants of land made by the Spanish authorities in the territory west of the Perdido, after the treaty of St. Ildefonso, should be null and void, excepting those to actual settlers , acquired before December 20, 1803. Garcia v. Lee, 12 Peters , 511.
The controversy relative to the country lying between the Mississippi and the Perdido rivers, and the validity of the grants made by Spain in the disputed territory after the cession of Louisiana to the United States, were carefully examined in the case of Foster & Elam v. Neilson . The supreme court, in that case, decided that the question of boundary between the United States and Spain was a question for the political departments of the government : that the legislative and executive branches having decided the question, the courts of the United States are bound to regard the boundary determined by them as the true one ; that grants made by the Spanish authorities of lands, which, according to this boundary line, belonged to the United States, gave no title to the grantees, in opposition to those claiming under the United States ; unless the Spanish grants were protected by the subsequent arrangements made between the two governments ; and that no such arrangements were to be found in the treaty of 1819, by which Spain ceded the Floridas to the United States, according to the fair import of its words, and its true con. struction. Ibid.
In the case of Foster & Elam v. Neilson , the supreme court said that the Florida treaty of 1819 , declares that all grants made before the 24th of January, 1818 , by the Spanish authorities, " shall be ratified and confirmed to the persons in possession of the lands, to the same extent that the same grants would be valid, if the territories had remained under the dominion of his Catholic Majesty :" and in deciding the case of Foster & Elam, the court held , that even if this stipulation applied to lands in the territory in question, yet the words used did not import a present confirmation by virtue of the treaty itself, but that they were words of contract : " that the ratification and confirmation which were promised , must be the act of the legislature ; and until such shall be passed, the court is not at liberty to disregard the existing laws on the subject." Afterwards, in the case of the United States v . Percheman , 7 Peters, 86, in reviewing the words of the Sth article of the treaty ; the court, for the reasons there assigned , came to a different conclusion ; and held , that the words were words of present confirmation, by the treaty, where the land had been rightfully granted before the cession ; and that it did not need the aid of an act of Congress to ratify and confirm the grant. This language was, however, applied by the court, and was intended to apply to grants made in a territory which belonged to Spain at the time ofthe grant. The case then before the court was one of that description . It was in relation to a grant of land in Florida, which unquestionably belonged to Spain at the time the grant was made ; and where the Spanish authorities had an undoubted right to grant, until the treaty of cession in 1819. It is of such grants that the court speak, when they declare them to be confirmed and protected by the true construction of the treaty ; and that they do not need the aid of an act of Congress to ratify and confirm the title of the purchaser. The court do not apply this principle to grants made within the territory of Louisiana. The case of Foster & Elam v. Neilson must, in all other respects , be considered as affirmed by the case of Percheman ; as it underwent a careful examination in that case, and as none of its principles were questioned except that referred to.

(a) In the sales of lots, in the city of Washington, the lots are not chargeable for their proportion of the internal alley laid out for the common benefit of the lots ; although the practice so to charge them has been heretofore universally acquiesced in by purchasers ; and if a purchaser has acquiesced in that
practice, and has received a conveyance accordingly without objection , yet he does not thereby acquire a fee simple in such proportion of the alley ; and he may in equity, recover back the purchase money which he has paid therefor.

In 1822 , Congress passed an act authorizing the corporation of Washington to drain the ground in and

near certain public reservations, and to improve and ornament certain parts of the public reservations.

The corporation are empowered to make an agreement, by which parts of the location of the canal shall

To effect these objects, the corporation is authorized to lay off in building lots certain parts of the public

be composed of a mayor, a board of aldermen and a board of common council, to be elected by ballot, as herein after directed . The board of
aldermen shall consist of eight members, to be elected for two years, two to be residents of and chosen from each ward by the qualified voters resident therein ; and the board of common council shall consist of

reservations, No. 10, 11 , and 12 , and of other squares , and also a part of B. street, as laid out and designated in the original plan of the city, which lots they may sell at auction , and apply the proceeds to those objects, and afterwards to enclosing, planting and improving other reservations, and building bridges, &c.; the surplus, if any, to be paid into the treasury of the United States. The act authorizes the heirs, &c . of the former proprietors of the land on which the city was laid out, who may consider themselves injured by the purposes of the act, to institute in the circuit court a bill in equity, in the nature of a petition of right, against the United States , setting forth the grounds of any claim they may consider themselves entitled to make, to be conducted according to the rules of a court of equity ; the court to hear and determine upon the claim of the plaintiffs, and what portion , if any, of the money arising from the sale of the lots they may be entitled to, with a right of appeal to the supreme court. The plaintiffs , Van Ness and wife, filed in the circuit court their bill against the United States and the corporation of Washington, claiming title to the lots which had been thus sold, under David Burns, the original proprietor of that part of the city, and father of one of the plaintiffs, on the ground that by the agreement between the United States and the original proprietors , upon laying out the city, those reservations and streets were, for ever, to remain for public use ; and , without the consent of the proprietors, could not be otherwise appropriated or sold for private use ; that the act of Congress was a violation of that contract ; that by such sale and appropriation for private use the right of the United States thereto was determined, or that the original proprietors re -acquired a right to have the reservations, &c. laid out in building lots for their joint and equal benefit with the United States, or that they were in equity entitled to the whole or a moiety of the proceeds of the sales of the lots. Held, by the supreme court, that no rights or claims exist in the former proprietors or their heirs, and that the proceedings of the corporation of Washington, under and in conformity with the provisions of the act, are valid and effectual for the purposes of the act. Van Ness et al. v . The City of Washington and the United States, 4 Peters, 232.
The official tax books of the corporation of Washington , made up by the register from the original returns or lists of the assessors laid before the court of appeals, he being empowered by the ordinances of the corporation to correct the valuations made by the assessors , are evidence ; and it is not required that the assessor's original lists shall be produced in evidence, to prove the assessment of the taxes on real estate in the city of Washington . Ronkendorf v. Taylor's Lessee, 4 Peters , 349.
In an ex parte proceeding, as a sale of land for taxes under a special authority, great strictness is required. To divest an individual of his property against his consent, every substantial requisite of the law must be complied with. No presumption can be raised , in behalf of a collector who sells real estate for taxes, to cure any radical defect in his proceedings ; and the proof of regularity devolves upon the person who claims under the collector's sale. Ibid.
Proof of the regular appointment of the assessors is not necessary. They acted under the authority of the corporation , and the highest evidence of this fact is the sanction given to their returns. Ibid.
The act of Congress, under which the lot in the city of Washington in controversy was sold, required that public notice of the time and place of sale of lots, the property of non- residents, should be given, by advertising " once a week " in some newspaper in the city for three months. Notice of the sale of the lot in controversy was published for three months ; but in the course of that period, eleven days at one time, at another ten days , and at another eight days transpired in succeeding weeks, between the insertions of the advertisement in the newspapers. "A week " is a definite period of time, commencing on Sunday and ending on Saturday. The notice was published Monday, January 6th, and was omitted until Saturday, January 18th, leaving an interval of eleven days. Still the publication on Saturday was within the week preceding the notice of the 6th ; and this was sufficient. It would be a most rigid construction of the act of Congress , justified neither by its spirit nor its language, to say that this notice must be published on any particular day of a week. If published once a week for three months, the law is complied with, and its object effectuated. Ibid.
No doubt can exist that a part of a lot may be sold for taxes, where they have accrued on such part. Ibid.
The lot on which the taxes were assessed , belonged to two persons as tenants in common . The assessment was made by a valuation of each half of the lot. To make a sale of the interest of one tenant in common for unpaid taxes valid , it need not extend to the interest of both claimants ; one having paid his tax, the interest of the other may well be sold for the balance. Ibid.
The advertisement purported to sell " half of lot No. 4, in square No. 491 ; " and the other half was advertised in the same manner, as belonging to the other tenant in common. This was not a sufficient
advertisement ; and a sale made under the same was void. It is not sufficient that in an advertisement of land for sale for unpaid taxes, such a description is given as would enable the persons desirous of purchasing, to ascertain the situation of the property by inquiry ; nor, ifthe purchaser, at the sale, had been informed of every fact necessary to enable him to fix a value upon the property, would the sale be valid, unless the same information had been communicated to the public in the notice. Ibid.
The 10th section of the act of Congress provides that real property in Washington , on which two or more years' taxes shall be due and unpaid, may be sold , &c . In this section a distinction is made between a general and a special tax. Property may be sold to pay the former as soon as two years' tax shall be due ; but to pay the latter, property cannot be sold until the expiration of two years after the second year's tax becomes due. The taxes for which the property in controversy was sold , became due , by the ordinance of the corporation , on the 1st day of January , 1821 and 1822. The special tax for paving was charged against the lot in 1820, and became due on the first of January, 1821 : but the ground on which it was assessed, was not liable to be sold for the tax until the 1st of January, 1823. The first notice of the sale was given on the 6th of December, 1822, nearly a month before the lot was liable to be sold for the special tax of 1820. Held , by the supreme court, that the whole period should have elapsed , which wliasshende.ceIsbsiadr.y to render the lot liable to be sold for the special tax, before the advertisement was pub.

June 13, 1812 . CHAP. XCIX.--An Act making further provision for settling the claims to land
in the territory of Missouri.(a)
Be it enacted by the Senate and House ofRepresentatives ofthe United
States of America in Congress assembled, That the rights, titles and
(a) Land titles in Missouri :-
The state of Missouri was formerly part of the territory, first of France, next of Spain , then of France, who ceded it to the United States by the treaty of 1803, in full propriety, sovereignty and dominion , as she had acquired and held it ; by which this government put itself in place of the former sovereigns, and became invested with all their rights, subject to their concomitant obligations to the inhabitants . Both were regulated by the law of nations , according to which the rights of property are protected , even in the case of a conquered country , and held sacred and inviolable when it is ceded by treaty, with or without any stipulation to such effect ; and the laws, whether in writing, or evidenced by the usage and customs of the conquered or ceded country, continue in force, until altered by the new sovereign. Strother v. Lucas, 12 Peters, 410.
No principle can be better established by the authority of the supreme court, than " that the acts of an officer, to whom a public duty is assigned by his king, within the sphere of that duty, are prima facie taken to be within his power." The principles on which it rests, are believed to be too deeply founded in law and reason, ever to be successfully assailed . He who would controvert a grant executed by the lawful authority, with all the solemnities required by law, takes on himself the burthen of showing that the officer has transcended the powers conferred upon him ; or that the transaction is tainted with fraud. Ibid.
Where the act of an officer to pass the title to land according to the Spanish law, is done contrary to the written order of the king, produced at the trial, without any explanation, it shall be presumed that the power has not been exceeded : that the act was done on the motive set out therein ; and according to some order known to the king and his officers , though not to his subjects : and courts ought to require very full proof, that he had transcended his powers, before they so determine it. Ibid.
In favour of long possession and ancient appropriation , every thing which was done shall be presumed to have been rightfully done ; and though it does not appear to have been done, the law will presume that whatever was necessary has been done. Ibid.
The stipulations of the treaty ceding Louisiana to the United States , affording that protection or security to claims under the French or Spanish government to which the act of Congress refers, are in the first, second and third articles. They extended to all property until Louisiana became a member of the Union ; into which the inhabitants were to be incorporated as soon as possible, " and admitted to all the

claims, to town or village lots, out lots, common field lots and commons, in, adjoining and belonging to the several towns or villages of Portage des Sioux, St. Charles, St. Louis, St. Ferdinand, Villago a Robert, Carondelet, St. Genevieve, New Madrid, New Bourbon, Little Prairie and Arkansas, in the territory of Missouri , which lots have been inha-

rights, advantages and immunities of citizens of the United States." The perfect inviolability and security of property is among these rights. Delassus v. The United States, 9 Peters, 117.
The right of property is protected and secured by the treaty, and no principle is better settled in this country, than that an inchoate title to lands is property. This right would have been sacred , independent of the treaty. The sovereign who acquires an inhabited country , acquires full dominion over it ; but this dominion is never supposed to divest the vested rights of individuals to property. The language of the treaty ceding Louisiana, excludes any idea of interfering with private property. Ibid.
On the 18th of April, 1802 , the lieutenant-governor of Upper Louisiana granted sixteen hundred arpents of land near certain rivers named in the grant, with directions to survey the same in a vacant place ofthe royal domain ; but no survey was made before the cession of Louisiana to the United States. By the Court-As the grant contained no description of the land granted, and was not located within the time prescribed by the act of Congress of the 10th of March, 1804, it comes directly within the point decided by the supreme court in the case of John Smith, T., and cannot be confirmed. Wherry v. The United States, 10 Peters , 338.
In repeated decisions, the supreme court have affirmed the authority of local governors, under the crown of Spain, to grant land in Louisiana, before the same was ceded by Spain to France : and the court have also affirmed the validity of descriptive grants, though not surveyed before the 11th of March, 1804, in Missouri, and the 24th of January, 1818 , in Florida. Mackey v. The United States, 10 Peters, 340.
A grant or concession made by an officer who is by law authorized to make it, carries with it prima facie evidence that it is within his powers. No excess of them, or departure from them, is to be presumed. He violates his duty by such excess, and is responsible for it. He who alleges that an officer entrusted with an important duty has violated his instructions, must show it. Delassus r. The United States, 9 Peters , 117.
The instructions of governor O'Reilly, relative to granting lands in Louisiana, were considered by the court, in 8 Peters, 455. These regulations were intended for the general government of subordinate officers, and not to control and limit the power ofthe person from whose will they emanated . The Baron De Carondelet must be supposed to have had all the powers which had been vested in Don O'Reilly ; and a concession ordered by him is as valid as a similar concession directed by governor O'Reilly would have been. Ibid.
A concession of land was made by the lieutenant-governor of Upper Louisiana, at the time when the power of granting lands was vested in the governors of provinces. This power was, in 1799, after the concession, transferred to the intendant- general ; and after this transfer, in January, 1800, the order of survey of the land was made by the lieutenant-governor. The validity of the order of survey depends on the authority of the lieutenant-governor to make it. The lieutenant-governor was also a sub-delegate, and as such was empowered to make inchoate grants. The grant was confirmed . Chouteau's heirs v. The United States , 9 Peters , 137.
The transfer of the power to make concessions of lands belonging to the royal domain of Spain, from the governor-general to the intendant- general, did not affect the power of the sub-delegate, who made this concession. The order in this case is the foundation of title, and is, according to the act of Congress on the subject of confirming titles to lands in Missouri, &c. , and the general understanding and usage of Louisiana and Missouri, capable of being perfected into a complete title. It is property, capable of being alienated, of being subjected to debts and is, as such, to be held as sacred and inviolate as other property. Ibid.
A concession of one league square of land, in Upper Louisiana , was made by Don Zenon Trudeau, the lieutenant-governor of that province, to Auguste Chouteau , and a decree made by him directing the surveyor-general of the province to put him in possession of the land, and to survey the same, in order to enable Chouteau to solicit a complete title thereto from the governor - general, who by the said decree was informed that the circumstances of Chouteau were such as entitled him to a grant of the land . The land
was surveyed, and the grantee put in full possession of it on the 20th of December, 1803. He retained possession of it until his death. The objection to the validity of the concession was, that the petitioner had not as many tame cattle as the eighth regulation of governor O'Reilly, governor- general of Louisiana , required. That regulation required that the applicant for a grant of a league square of land should make it appear that he is possessed of one hundred head of tame cattle, some horses and sheep, and two slaves to look after them, a proportion which shall always be observed for the grants, &c. By the Court-" In the spirit of the decisions which have been heretofore made by the supreme court, and of the acts of confirmation passed by Congress, the fact that the applicant possessed the requisite amount of property to entitle him to the land he solicited, was submitted to the officer who decided on the application ; and he is not bound to prove it to the court, which passes on the validity of the grant. These incomplete titles were transferable, and the assignee might not possess the means of proving the exact number of cattle in possession of the petitioner when the concession was made." The grant was confirmed . Ibid. 147.
If the court can trust the information received on this subject, neither the governor nor the intendantgeneral has ever refused to perfect an incomplete title granted by a deputy governor or a sub-delegate. Ibid.
The regulation made by Don O'Reilly, as to the quantity of land to be granted to an individual, is not that no individual shall receive grants for more than one league square , but that no grant shall exceed a league square. The words of the regulation do not forbid different grants to the same person ; and, so far as the court are informed , it has never been so construed. Ibid.
The act of Congress passed 13th June, 1812 , confirming the titles and claims of certain towns and vil. lages to village lots and commons, gave a title which is paramount to a title held under an old Spanish concession confirmed by Congress in 1836. Chouteau v. Eckhart, 2 Howard, 344.

(a) Slavery in the District of Columbia :-
The plaintiffs in error filed a petition for freedom in the circuit court of the United States for the county of Washington, and they proved that they were born in the state of Virginia, as slaves of Richard B. Lee, now deceased , who moved with his family into the county of Washington, in the District of Columbia, about the year 1816 , leaving the petitioners residing in Virginia as his slaves, until the year 1820, when the petitioner Barbara was removed to the county of Alexandria, in the District of Columbia, where she was hired to Mrs. Muir, and continued with her thus hired for the period of one year. That the petitioner, Sam, was in like manner removed to the county of Alexandria, and was hired to General Walter Jones, for a period of about five or six months. That after the expiration of the said periods of hiring, the petitioners were removed to the said county of Washington , where they continued to reside as the slaves of the said Richard B. Lee until his death, and since, as the slaves of his widow, the defendant. On the part of the defendant in error, a preliminary objection was made to the jurisdiction of the supreme court, growing out of the act of Congress of the 2d of April, 1816, which declares that no cause shall be removed from the circuit court for the District of Columbia, to the supreme court, by appeal or writ of error, unless the matter in dispute shall be of the value of one thousand dollars, or upwards. By the Court-The matter in dispute in this case, is the freedom of the petitioners. The judgment of the court below is against their claims to freedom ; the matter in dispute, is, therefore, to the plaintiffs in error, the value of their freedom, and this is not susceptible of a pecuniary valuation . Had the judgment been in favour of the petitioners, and the writ of error brought by the party claiming to be the owner, the value of the slaves as property, would have been the matter in dispute, and affidavits might be admitted to ascertain such value. But affidavits, estimating the value of freedom, are entirely inadmissible, and no doubt is entertained of the jurisdiction of the court. Lee v. Lee, 8 Peters, 44.
The circuit court refused to instruct the jury that if they should believe, from the evidence, that bring. ing the petitioners from Virginia to Alexandria, by their owner, and hiring them there, was merely colourable, with intent to evade the law, that then the petitioners are entitled to their freedom. By the Maryland law, of 1796 , it was declared , that it shall not be lawful to import or bring into this state, by land or water, any negro, mulatto, or other slave, for sale, or to reside within this state ; and any person brought into this state as a slave, contrary to this act, if a slave before, shall thereupon cease to be the property of the person so importing, and shall be free. And by the act of Congress of the 27th of February, 1801 , it is provided, that the laws of the state of Maryland, as they then existed , should be, and continue in force in that part of the district which was ceded by that state to the United States.

Maryland law of 1796 is, therefore, in force in the county of Washington ; and the petitioners, if brought
directly from the state of Virginia into the county of Washington, would, under the provisions of that law, be entitled to their freedom. By the act of Congress of the 24th of June, 1812, it was declared ,
" that hereafter it shall be lawful for any inhabitant or inhabitants, in either of the said counties, (Wash-
ington and Alexandria,) owning and possessing any slave or slaves therein, to remove the same from one
county into the other, and to exercise, freely and fully, all the rights of property, in and over the said slave or slaves therein , which would be exercised over him, her, or them, in the county from whence the removal was made." Ibid.
The court erred in refusing to give the fourth instruction prayed on the part of the petitioner, which asked that it should be submitted to the jury whether, from the evidence, the bringing of the petitioners
from Virginia to Alexandria, and the hiring them there, was not merely colourable, with intent to evade the law. Ibid.
A wife having separated herself from her husband, for ill-treatment by him, applied to the county court of Prince George, Maryland , for alimony, which was allowed to her, pendente lite. The husband gave the wife a female negro slave, and some other property, in discharge of the alimony. She removed to Washington, hired out the slave , and afterwards, in consideration of a sum of money, and for other considerations, she manumitted , by deed, the slave, and her two infant children, the eldest not three years old. Some time after the arrangement between the husband and wife, a final separation took place be. tween them, by a verbal agreement ; each to retain " the property each had, and to be quits for ever," and the wife relinquished all further claim for alimony. After the death ofthe wife, the husband claimed the female and her children as his slaves. Held , that they were free by virtue of the deed of manumission executed by the wife. Wallingsford v.

manner and upon the principles herein before provided in case of cap-

ture.(b)

(a) The prize act of June 26th , 1812 , chap. 107 , operates as a grant from the United States to the captors, of all property rightfully captured by commissioned privateers , as prize of war. The Sally, 8 Cranch, 382 ; 3 Cond. Rep. 177.
Prize money must be distributed according to some written agreement of the parties, otherwise it is distributable according to the 4th sec. of the prize act of the 26th of June, 1812, chap. 107. A parol agreement as to distribution is void. The Dash, 1 Mason's C. C. R. 4.
If the shipping articles omit to state the shares, to which some of the officers and crew are entitled, they are still entitled to claim their shares under the prize act. Ibid.
A parol assignment of a share in prizes is void. Ibid.
All captures, made by non-commissioned captors , are made for the government and since the provisions in the prize acts as to the distribution of prize proceeds , are confined to public and private armed vessels, cruising under regular commissions ; the only claim which can be sustained by such non.com. missioned captors must be in the nature of salvage, for bringing in and preserving the property. The Dos Hermanos , 10 Wheat. 306 ; 6 Cond . Rep. 109.
The commander of a squadron, to whose command a ship of war is attached , and under whose orders she sails, is entitled to the flag- twentieth of all prizes made by such ship , although the other part of the squadron may never have sailed on the cruise, in consequence of a blockade by a superior force. Decatur v. Chew, 1 Gallis. C. C. R. 506.
To deprive such commander of his flag-twentieth , on account of his having left his station, under the sixth section of the act of April 23d , 1800 , chap. 33, it is indispensable that some local station should have been assigned him. Ibid.
Where no grant is made, all captures made under the authority of the executive, inure to the use of the government. The Emulous, i Gallis. C. C. R. 563.
As between public ships, the rule for the distribution of prizes is settled by the seventh article of the sixth section in the act of April 23d, 1800 , chap. 33, which provides that, in cases of joint capture, the capturing ships shall share " according to the number of men and guns on board each ship in sight. " The Despatch, 2 Gallis. C. C. R. 1 .
As to privateers, no statute regulation exists, and therefore their claims are settled by the general law of relative strength, which is to be measured by the number of men on board each ship. Ibid.
(b) Salvage in Prize Causes.-On a recapture of a vessel by a neutral vessel , no claim for salvage can arise , for the recapture was a hostile act, not justified by the situation of the nation to which the recapturing vessel belongs, in relation to that from the possession of which the vessel recaptured was taken. The degree of service rendered in such a case, is precisely the same as if it had been rendered by a belligerent ; yet, the rights accruing from the recapture are different, because no right can accrue from an act which was unlawful. Talbot v. Seeman , 1 Cranch, 1 ; 1 Cond. Rep. 229.
When a belligerent permits her cruisers to capture neutral vessels, and carry them in for adjudication , and thus subjects such vessels to perils, almost equal to those of absolute capture, salvage for a recapture of such a neutral vessel will be allowed. Ibid.
American property recaptured , was restored on payment of salvage ; the libel having prayed a condemnation as prize, and no salvage having been claimed . The question of salvage is incident to the question of prize. The Adeline, 9 Cranch, 244 ; 3 Cond. Rep. 397.
A merchant ship , the property of subjects of the king of Great Britain , was captured on the high seas by a French squadron , a prize master and crew put on board of her, and she remained in company with the captors upwards of twenty-four hours, when she was left by the prize master and the crew ; frequent

for the captors. Salvage, amounting to one third of the gross proceeds of the sales of the ship and cargo, were decreed to the owners, masters and crew of the American ship ; and the residue of the pro-

ceeds were ordered to be paid to the French republic, or those concerned in the capture. M'Donough v. Danery, and the Ship Mary Ford, 3 Dall. 188 ; 1 Cond. Rep. 94.

One half of the whole value of an American vessel and cargo, recaptured by a vessel of war of the

An American vessel was captured by the enemy, and after condemnation and sale to a subject of the enemy, was recaptured by an American privateer. Held , that the original owner was not entitled to

prize act of 26th June , 1812, chap. 107. The Star, 3 Wheat. 78 ; 4 Cond . Rep. 198. In order to entitle to salvage, as upon a recapture or rescue, the property must have been in the pos-

Salvage allowed upon a recapture of a ransomed ship, the ransom bill declaring that the sum agreed upon therein, should be payable only upon the arrival of the vessel at her port of destination , which she

never reached. The Harriet, Bee's D. C. R. 128. In case of a recapture by a public vessel of war, the salvage can be ascertained only by a sale of the
property, unless both parties consent to an appraisement. The Dolphin, Bee's D. C. R. 152.
Salvage is not due for rescuing the vessel of a neutral out of the hands of a belligerent, who has taken possession for a supposed violation of a treaty or of the law of nations. The Antelope, Bee's D. C. R. 233.

(a) The decisions of the Courts of the United States, on " Trading with the Enemy," have been : Action of assumpsit to recover the balance of an account current for merchandise purchased in Eng. land by order of the defendants. The defence was, that the contract was made during the war, and therefore void. By the Court- The doctrine is not to be questioned at this day, that, during a state of hostility, the citizens of the hostile states are incapable of contracting with each other. Scholefield v. Eichelberger, 7 Peters, 586.
To say that this rule is without exception, would be assuming too great latitude. The question has never yet been examined whether a contract for necessaries, or even for money to enable the individual to get home, could not be enforced ; and analogies familiar to the law, as well as the influence of the general rule , in international law, that the severities of war are to be diminished by all safe and practical means, might be appealed to in support of such an exception . But at present, it may be safely affirmed that there is no recognized exception, but permission of a state to its own citizens ; which is also implied in any treaty stipulation to that effect, entered into with a belligerent. Ibid.
Property engaged in illicit trade with the enemy, must be condemned to the captors, not to the United States. The Sally, Porter, Master, 8 Cranch, 382 ; 3 Cond. Rep. 177.
A vessel owned by citizens of the United States , sailed from Naples in the year 1812, for the United States, with a cargo, and a British license to carry the same to England. On her passage, hearing ofthe war, she altered her course for England, was captured by the British, carried into Ireland , libelled and acquitted , sold her cargo, and after a detention of seven months in Ireland , purchased a return cargo in England, sailed for the United States, and was captured by an American privateer. The vessel and cargo were condemned as prize to the captors. The Alexander, 8 Cranch, 169 ; 3 Cond. Rep. 72.
If a citizen of the United States establishes his domicil in a foreign country, between which and the United States hostilities afterwards break out, any property shipped by him before knowledge of the war, and captured by an American cruiser after the declaration of war, will be condemned as prize. The Venus, 8 Cranch, 253 ; 3 Cond . Rep . 109.
Illegal traffic stamps a hostile character on the property, and attaches to it all the penal consequences of enemy ownership . The Sally, 8 Cranch, 382 ; 3 Cond. Rep . 177.
The property of a citizen does not become divested , ipso facto , by the mere act of illicit intercourse with the enemy; the property is only liable to be condemned as enemy's property, or as adhering to the enemy, if rightfully captured during the voyage. The Thomas Gibbons, 8 Cranch, 421 ; 3 Cond. Rep. 193.
A vessel sailing to an enemy port, after knowledge of the war, and captured, bringing thence a cargo consisting chiefly of enemy goods, is liable to confiscation as prize of war. The St. Lawrence, 8 Cranch, 434; 3 Cond. Rep. 202.
Trading with the enemy is not excused by the necessity of obtaining funds to pay the expenses of the ship ; nor by the opinion of an American minister expressed to the master, that by undertaking the voyage he would violate no law of the United States. The Joseph, 8 Cranch, 451 ; 3 Cond. Rep. 212.
If, upon the breaking out of a war, a citizen has a right to withdraw his property from the enemy's country, it is necessary it should be exercised with due diligence, and within a reasonable time after the knowledge of hostilities. The St. Lawrence, 9 Cranch , 120 ; 3 Cond. Rep. 301.
If a cargo be innocently put on board in an enemy's country, if at that time the importation be lawful, it cannot be rendered unlawful by a detention , occasioned in the course of the voyage, either by the
perils of the sea or the act of the enemy ; unless this effect be produced by some positive act of the legislature. The Mary, 9 Cranch, 126 ; 3 Cond . Rep. 306.
An American citizen is equally guilty of trading with the enemy, whether that trade is carried on between a hostile port and the United States, or between such port and any foreign nation . The Rugen, 1 Wheat. 62 ; 3 Cond . Rep. 485.
The offence of trading with the enemy is complete, the moment a vessel sails with intention to carry her cargo to a hostile port. Ibid.
A subject of a state at war cannot, under cover of neutral muniments , however regularly procured, or formal, violate with impunity his duty and allegiance to his own country. Ibid.
All trade with the enemy, unless with the permission of the sovereign , is interdicted ; and subjects the property engaged in it to the penalty of confiscation . The Rapid, 1 Gallis. C. C. R. 295.
All communication and intercourse with the enemy is prohibited , and it is in nowise important, whether the property engaged in the inimical communication be bought and sold , or merely transported and shipped. Ibid.
A citizen of the United States cannot lawfully withdraw his property, acquired before the war, from the enemy's country, after he has knowledge of the war, without permission of government. The St. Lawrence, 1 Gallis. C. C. R. 467 .
If a vessel be sent from the United States, after knowledge of the war, to the enemy's country to with. draw such property, the vessel and cargo are subject to capture and condemnation, jure belli. 1 Gallis. C. C. R. 295.
The property of citizens taken trading with the enemy, is considered as quasi enemy's property. Ibid.
A trade to a neutral port, during war, is not rendered illegal from the mere efrcumstance that the interests of the enemy are thereby aided, or his policy enforced : it must, before it can be liable to con. demnation on that ground , be carried on, on account ofthe enemy, under contract with him, destined for h5i1s3use, or voluntarily incorporated into his service by licenses. The Liverpool Packet, 1 Gallis. C. C. R. .
The circumstance that a neutral is engaged in enemy navigation does not subject all his trade from the neutral country, on neutral voyages, to the enemy character. Ibid.

Every voyage from an enemy port, especially with a cargo on board, and without the license of the government, carries with it a presumption of illegal traffic and hostile interests, from which nothing but the most explicit proofs by the claimants can relieve the cause. The presumption of illegal traffic arises,
notwithstanding any papers or any explanation of the persons found on board : the captors have a right to bring the property in, and subject the whole to the adjudication of a competent tribunal. In such case, damages and costs are never to be adjudged as against the captors. Ibid.
If, after a knowledge of the war, an American vessel go to an enemy port, and take in a cargo there, the vessel and cargo are liable to confiscation for trading with the enemy. The Alexander, 1 Gallis. C. C. R. 532.
If an American vessel, after knowledge of the war, proceed from a neutral to a hostile port on freight, it is a trading with the enemy, which subjects the vessel to forfeiture ; and she is liable therefore on her return voyage to the United States. The Joseph, 1 Gallis. C. C. R. 545.
In cases of trading with the enemy, the property is deemed quasi enemy's property, and it is condemned to the captors and not to the United States. Ibid.
No principle of national or municipal law is better settled than that all contracts with an enemy, made during war, are utterly void. The Emulous, 1 Gallis . C. C. R. 563.
A shipment made from the enemy's country, after a knowledge of the war, by an American citizen, subjects the property to condemnation as prize of war. The Mary, 1 Gallis. C. C. R. 620.
A shipment made, after a known war, by an American citizen , subjects the property to condemnation as prize of war. The Diana, 2 Gallis. C. C. R. 93.
If an American vessel take on board a cargo from an enemy's ship, under the pretence that it is ransomed, it is an illegal traffic, for which, by the law of war, she is liable to condemnation as prize of war ; and may be seized on the return voyage. The Lord Wellington , 2 Gallis. C. C. R. 103.
A citizen of the United States may lawfully draw a bill on a subject of a foreign power, with whom we are at war; such an act not leading to any injurious intercourse, nor amounting to a trading with the enemy. United States v. Barker, Paine's C. C. R. 156.
An American vessel, after the commencement of hostilities with Great Britain, sailed , having on board a messenger from the British minister in the United States, with despatches for his government, and a letter of protection from British capture ; this is a sufficient cause of condemnation.

All contracts with an enemy are not necessarily void. Cases of extreme necessity, form exceptions to the rule. Contracts made under license of the government, whether they arise directly or collaterally, out of the licensed trade ; or if the enemy, with whom the contract is made, be in the hostile country, by license of that government, (cases of ransom bonds,) so contracts made by prisoners of war, for their subsistence, are also exceptions.

A voyage from an enemy port with a cargo on board, without the license of the government, is of itself a probable cause for capture. The Liverpool Packet, 1 Gallis . C. C. R. 513.
A trade to a neutral port is not illegal, although the public enemy derive benefit thereby, unless such trade be considered in connexion with, or subservient to , hostile interests and policy. Ibid.

At common law, any individual might seize for the king ; and upon this ground it has been held, that public or private armed ships may seize for violation of a statute. But, in such case, it is at the peril of the party making the seizure. The Rover, 2 Gallis. C. C. R. 240.

Land titles in Missouri :-
The state of Missouri was formerly part of the territory, first of France, next of Spain, then ofFrance, who ceded it to the United States by the treaty of 1803, in full propriety, sovereignty and dominion, as
she had acquired and held it ; by which this government put itself in place ofthe former sovereigns, and became invested with all their rights, subject to their concomitant obligations to the inhabitants. Both were regulated by the law of nations, according to which the rights of property are protected , even in the case of a conquered country, and held sacred and inviolable when it is ceded by treaty, with or without any stipulation to such effect ; and the laws, whether in writing, or evidenced by the usage and customs of the conquered or ceded country, continue in force, until altered by the new sovereign. Strother v. Lucas, 12 Peters, 410.
No principle can be better established by the authority of the supreme court, than " that the acts ofan officer, to whom a public duty is assigned by his king, within the sphere of that duty, are prima facie taken to be within his power." The principles on which it rests, are believed to be too deeply founded in law and reason, ever to be successfully assailed. He who would controvert a grant executed by the lawful authority, with all the solemnities required by law, takes on himself the burthen of showing that the officer has transcended the powers conferred upon him ; or that the transaction is tainted with fraud. Ibid.

sons who had filed a notice of claim to any tract of land lying within the district of Louisiana (now territory of Missouri) with the recorder of land titles, according to law, and have not exhibited any testimony or written evidence in support of the same, and whose claim has not already

Further time

Where the act of an officer to pass the title to land according to the Spanish law, is done contrary to the written order of the king, is produced at the trial, without any explanation, it shall be presumed that the power has not been exceeded : that the act was done on the motive set out therein ; and according to some order known to the king and his officers, though not to his subjects : and courts ought to require very full proof, that he had transcended his powers, before they so determine it. Ibid.
In favour of long possession and ancient appropriation , every thing which was done shall be presumed to have been rightfully done ; and though it does not appear to have been done, the law will presume that whatever was necessary has been done. Ibid.
The stipulations of the treaty ceding Louisiana to the United States, affording that protection or security to claims under the French or Spanish government to which the act of Congress refers, are in the first, second and third articles. They extended to all property until Louisiana became a member of the Union; into which the inhabitants were to be incorporated as soon as possible, " and admitted to all the rights, advantages and immunities of citizens of the United States." The perfect inviolability and security of property is among these rights. Delassus v. The United States, 9 Peters, 117.
The right of property is protected and secured by the treaty, and no principle is better settled in this country, than that an inchoate title to lands is property. This right would have been sacred, independent of the treaty. The sovereign who acquires an inhabited country, acquires full dominion over it ; but this dominion is never supposed to divest the vested rights of individuals to property. The language of the treaty ceding Louisiana, excludes any idea of interfering with private property. Ibid.
On the 18th of April , 1802, the lieutenant-governor of Upper Louisiana granted sixteen hundred arpents of land near certain rivers named in the grant, with directions to survey the same in a vacant place of the royal domain; but no survey was made before the cession of Louisiana to the United States. Bythe Court-As the grant contained no description of the land granted, and was not located within the time prescribed by the act of Congress of the 10th of March, 1804, it comes directly within the point decided by the supreme court in the case of John Smith, T., and cannot be confirmed. Wherry v. The United States, 10 Peters, 338.
In repeated decisions, the supreme court have affirmed the authority of local governors, under the crown of Spain, to grant land in Louisiana, before the same was ceded by Spain to France : and the court have also affirmed the validity of descriptive grants, though not surveyed before the 11th of March, 3148004, in Missouri, and the 24th of January, 1818, in Florida . . Mackey v. The United States, 10 Peters,
A grant or concession made by an officer who is by law authorized to make it, carries with it prima facie evidence that it is within his powers. No excess of them, or departure from them, is to be presumed. He violates his duty by such excess, and is responsible for it. He who alleges that an officer entrusted with an important duty has violated his instructions , must show it. Delassus v. The United States, 9 Peters , 117.
The instructions of governor O'Reilly, relative to granting lands in Louisiana, were considered by the court, in 8 Peters, 455. These regulations were intended for the general government of subordinate officers, and not to control and limit the power of the person from whose will they emanated. The Baron De Carondelet must be supposed to have had all the powers which had been vested in Don O'Reilly; and a concession ordered by him is as valid as a similar concession directed by governor O'Reilly would have been. Ibid.
A concession of land was made by the lieutenant-governor of Upper Louisiana, at the time when the power of granting lands was vested in the governors of provinces. This power was, in 1799, after the concession, transferred to the intendant-general ; and after this transfer, in January, 1800, the order of survey of the land was made by the lieutenant-governor. The validity of the order of survey depends on the authority of the lieutenant-governor to make it. The lieutenant-governor was also a sub-delegate, and as such was empowered to make inchoate grants. The grant was confirmed. Chouteau's heirs v. The United States, 9 Peters, 137.
The transfer of the power to make concessions of lands belonging to the royal domain of Spain, from the governor-general to the intendant-general, did not affect the power of the sub -delegate , who made this concession . The order in this case is the foundation of title, and is, according to the act of Congress on the subject of confirming titles to lands in Missouri, &c ., and the general understanding and usage of Louisiana and Missouri, capable of being perfected into a complete title. It is property, capable of being alienated , of being subjected to debts : and is, as such, to be held as sacred and inviolate as other property. Ibid.
A concession of one league square of land , in Upper Louisiana, was made by Don Zenon Trudeau, the lieutenant-governor of that province , to Auguste Chouteau, and a decree made by him directing the surveyor-general of the province to put him in possession of the land, and to survey the same, in order to enable Chouteau to solicit a complete title thereto from the governor -general , who by the said decree was informed that the circumstances of Chouteau were such as entitled him to a grant ofthe land. The land was surveyed, and the grantee put in full possession ofit on the 20th of December, 1803. He retained possession of it until his death. The objection to the validity of the concession was, that the petitioner had not as many tame cattle as the eighth regulation of governor O'Reilly, governor-general of Louisiana , required. That regulation required that the applicant for a grant of a league square of land should make it appear that he is possessed of one hundred head of tame cattle, some horses and sheep, and two slaves to look after them, a proportion which shall always be observed for the grants, &c. By the Court- In the spirit of the decisions which have been heretofore made by the supreme court, and of the acts of confirmation passed by Congress , the fact that the applicant possessed the requisite amount of property to entitle him to the land he solicited, was submitted to the officer who decided on the application ; and he is not bound to prove it to the court, which passes on the validity of the grant. These incomplete titles were transferable, and the assignee might not possess the means of proving the exact number of cattle in possession of the petitioner when the concession was made. The grant was confirmed. Ibid. 147.

If the court can trust the information received on this subject, neither the governor nor the intendantgeneral has ever refused to perfect an incomplete title granted by a deputy governor or a sub-delegate. Ibid.
The regulation made by Don O'Reilly, as to the quantity of land to be granted to an individual, is not that no individual shall receive grants for more than one league square, but that no grant shall exceed a
league square. The words of the regulation do not forbid different grants to the same person ; and, so far as the court are informed, it has never been so construed. Ibid.
