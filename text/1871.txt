ADVERTISEMENT.

In publishing the following Laws, the same plan has been adopted that was prescribed in the Joint Resolution of Congress of March 3, 1845 (Vol. V., p. 798), authorizing a subscription to the edition of all the Laws of the United States published by us. A close examination of this volume will disclose some apparent errors in the Laws as here printed; but as we procure a careful collation with the records at Washington by an experienced reader of the Department of State, and scrupulously follow the original, any seeming errors must be attributed to the Rolls, and not to us. Where anything absolutely necessary to the sense is omitted in the Rolls, it is inserted in the text, enclosed in brackets.
We intend to publish annually, and as soon after the close of each Session of Congress as is possible, the Acts of that Session, in a similar form and with a similar arrangement.
It will be seen by the following extracts from the Act of Congress, August 8, 1846 (Vol. IX., p. 76), and the Joint Resolutions of September 26, 1850 (Vol. IX., p. 564), and March 31, 1866 (Vol. XIV., p. 352), that our edition has been sanctioned by Congress, and is the Offici al Edi ti on .
" And whereas said edition of the said Laws and Treaties of the United States has been carefully collated and compared with the original rolls in the archives of the Government, under the inspection and supervision of the Attorney-General of the United States, as duly certified by that officer : therefore, Be it further enacted, that said edition of the Laws and Treaties of the United States, published by Little & Brown, is hereby declared to be competent evidence of the several public and private acts of Congress, and of the several treaties therein contained, in all the courts of law and equity and maritime jurisdiction, and in all the tribunals and public offices of the United States and of the several States, without any further proof or authentication thereof." -- Appro ve d , August 8, 1846.
" Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the Secretary of State be authorized and directed to contract with Little & Brown to furnish their annual Statutes at Large, printed in conformity with the plan adopted by Congress in eighteen hundred and forty-five, instead of the edition usually issued by his order, under the act of Congress of April twentieth, eighteen hundred and eighteen, and which conforms to an edition of the laws now out of use." -- Appro ve d , September 26, 1850.
'Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the Secretary of State be, and he is hereby, authorized and directed to renew the contract of October thirty-first, eighteen hundred and fifty, between the Department of State and Little, Brown, and Company, of Boston, Massachusetts, for the annual publication of the Statutes at Large of the United States until otherwise ordered by Congress, in conformity with the joint resolutions approved respectively March third, eighteen hundred and forty-five, and September thirtieth [twenty-sixth], eighteen hundred and fifty." -- Appro ved , March 31, 1866.

Whe re as in the fall of eighteen hundred and sixty-one it was decided Preamble. by the Secretary of War to cause to be destroyed all the railroad bridges in East Tennessee,, between Chattanooga and Bristol, and accordingly men were sent there to enlist parties to perform said work; and whereas one Captain David Fry did recruit and enlist as a portion of the force one Jacob Harmon and his two sons. He, Fry, administered the oath to said Harmon and sons ; there being no Bible at hand, he caused them to place their hands on the Union flag while he solemnly administered the oath to be ever faithful and true to the Union. He then ordered them to destroy the bridge across Lick Creek, and the trestle-work, nearly one mile in length, in Greene county, East Tennessee. They soon picked their opportunity, and, under the eye of Captain Fry, put fire to the bridge and trestle-work, and destroyed the same. And whereas the said Harmon and two sons were arrested, placed in a rebel prison, were tried by a rebel court-martial, convicted, and Harmon and one son hung till dead, near the town of Knoxville, East Tennessee, on the seventeenth of December, eighteen hundred and sixty-one (the other son having contracted disease while in prison, died) ; and whereas the said Harmon did employ counsel to defend himself and sons, for which he executed his notes to said attorneys, for the sum of three thousand dollars, and did give said parties a lien or mortgage upon his real estate to secure the same; and whereas on the twenty-seventh day of July, eighteen hundred and sixty-eight, a decree of sale of said land was ordered, for the sum of four thousand one hundred and ninety-three dollars and fifty cents, which, if no relief is given, will leave the widow with five children and but little means left whereby to make a support; and whereas it is evident that said Harmon and sons lost their lives in the service of the government, and now, in the name of justice, honor, and humanity, the Congress of the United States is in duty bound to relieve the widow and her children from this debt of oppression, they never having received one cent for the services rendered by her said husband: Therefore,
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States ofAmerica in Congress assembled, That the Secretary of the Treas- Payment to ury be, and he is hereby, directed to pay to Malinda Harmon, the widow Malinda Har-

Whe re as in the fall of eighteen hundred and sixty-one it was decided Preamble. by the Secretary of War to cause to be destroyed all the railroad bridges in East Tennessee,, between Chattanooga and Bristol, and accordingly men were sent there to enlist parties to perform said work; and whereas one Captain David Fry did recruit and enlist as a portion of the force one Jacob Harmon and his two sons. He, Fry, administered the oath to said Harmon and sons ; there being no Bible at hand, he caused them to place their hands on the Union flag while he solemnly administered the oath to be ever faithful and true to the Union. He then ordered them to destroy the bridge across Lick Creek, and the trestle-work, nearly one mile in length, in Greene county, East Tennessee. They soon picked their opportunity, and, under the eye of Captain Fry, put fire to the bridge and trestle-work, and destroyed the same. And whereas the said Harmon and two sons were arrested, placed in a rebel prison, were tried by a rebel court-martial, convicted, and Harmon and one son hung till dead, near the town of Knoxville, East Tennessee, on the seventeenth of December, eighteen hundred and sixty-one (the other son having contracted disease while in prison, died) ; and whereas the said Harmon did employ counsel to defend himself and sons, for which he executed his notes to said attorneys, for the sum of three thousand dollars, and did give said parties a lien or mortgage upon his real estate to secure the same; and whereas on the twenty-seventh day of July, eighteen hundred and sixty-eight, a decree of sale of said land was ordered, for the sum of four thousand one hundred and ninety-three dollars and fifty cents, which, if no relief is given, will leave the widow with five children and but little means left whereby to make a support; and whereas it is evident that said Harmon and sons lost their lives in the service of the government, and now, in the name of justice, honor, and humanity, the Congress of the United States is in duty bound to relieve the widow and her children from this debt of oppression, they never having received one cent for the services rendered by her said husband: Therefore,
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States ofAmerica in Congress assembled, That the Secretary of the Treas- Payment to ury be, and he is hereby, directed to pay to Malinda Harmon, the widow Malinda Har-
mon, widow of of Jacob Harmon, deceased, of Greene county, East Tennessee, the sum ,Jacob Harmon. of four thousand six hundred and ninety-six dollars and seventy cents, out of any moneys in the treasury not otherwise appropriated.

No judgment of a Spanish tribunal, disallowing the affirmation of a party that he is a citizen of the United States, shall prevent the arbitrators from hearing a reclamation presented in behalf of said party by the United States Government; nevertheless, in any case heard by the arbitrators, the Spanish Government may traverse the allegation of American citizenship, and thereupon competent and sufficient proof thereof will be required. The commission having recognized the quality of American citizens in the claimants, they will acquire the rights accorded to them by the present stipulations as such citizens. And it is further agreed that the arbitrators shall not have jurisdiction of any reclamation made in behalf of a native-born Spanish subject, naturalized in the United States, if it shall appear that the same subject-matter having been adjudicated by a competent tribunal in Cuba, and the claimant, having appeared therein, either in person or by his duly appointed attorney, and being required by the laws of Spain to make a declaration of his nationality, failed to declare that he was a citizen of the United States; in such case, and for the purposes of this arbitration, it shall be deemed and taken that the claimant, by his own default, had renounced his allegiance to the United States. And it is further agreed that the arbitrators shall not have jurisdiction of any demands growing out of contracts.
G. The expenses of the arbitration will be defrayed by a percentage to be added to the amount awarded. The compensation of the arbitrators and umpire shall not exceed three thousand dollars each; the same allowance shall be made to each of the two advocates representing respectively the two governments; and the arbitrators may employ a secretary at a compensation not exceeding the sum of five dollars a day for every day actually and necessarily given to the business of the arbitration.
7. The two governments will accept the awards made in the several cases submitted to the said arbitration as final and conclusive, and will give full effect to the same in good faith and as soon as possible.

ing every uncertainty which may hitherto have arisen respecting that which, upon principles of fairness and justice, ought to constitute a legal blockade, they hereby expressly declare that such places only shall be considered blockaded as shall be actually invested by naval
forces capable of preventing the entry of neutrals and so stationed as to create an evident danger on their part to attempt it.

ogni dubbio che possa finora essere stato elevato riguardo a quanto e necessario secondo i principii d' equita e di giustizia per costituire un blocco legale, esse qui espressamente dichiarano che saranno considerati come bloccati soltanto quei luoghi che saranno effettivamente investiti da forze navali capaci d'impedire 1'accesso ai neutrali, e in guisa disposte da creare, per parte dei medesimi un evidente pericolo d'entrarvi.

And whereas it frequently happens that vessels sail for a port or a place belonging to an enemy without know-
ing that the same is besieged, blockaded, or invested, it is agreed that every vessel so circumstanced may be turned away from such port or place, but shall not be detained, nor shall any part of her cargo, if not contraband of war, be confiscated, unless, after a warning of such blockade or investment from an officer commanding a vessel of the blockading forces, by an indorsement of such
officer on the papers of the vessel, mentioning the date and the latitude and longitude where such indorsement was made, she shall again attempt to enter; but she shall be permitted to go to any other port or place she shall think proper. Nor shall any vessel of either, that may have entered into such a port before the same was actually besieged, blockaded, or invested by the other, be restrained from quitting such place with her cargo, nor, if found therein after the reduction and surrender, shall such vessel or her cargo be liable to confiscation, but they shall be restored to the owners thereof; and if any vessel, having thus entered any port before the blockade took place, shall take on board a cargo after the blockade be established, she shall be subject to being warned by the blockading forces to return to the port blockaded and discharge the said cargo, and if, after receiving the said warning, the vessel shall persist in going out with the cargo, she shall
be liable to the same consequences

What to be deemed contraband of war.

The liberty of navigation and commerce secured to neutrals by the stipulations of this treaty shall extend to all kinds of merchandise, excepting those only which are distinguished by the name of contraband of war. And, in order to remove all causes of doubt and misunderstanding upon this subject, the contracting parties expressly agree and declare that the following articles, and no others, shall be considered as comprehended under this denomination : --
1. Cannons, mortars, howitzers, swivels, blunderbusses, muskets, fusees, rifles, carbines, pistols, pikes, swords, sabres, lances, spears, halberds, bombs, grenades, powder, matches, balls, and all other things belonging to, and expressly manufactured for, the use of these arms.

3. Cavalry belts, war saddles and holsters.
4. And generally all kinds of arms and instruments of iron, steel, brass, and copper, or of any other materials manufactured, prepared, and formed expressly to make war by sea or land.

But each office shall give notice to the other of the rate it adopts and of any subsequent change thereof. These articles shall be forwarded under regulations of the dispatching post-office, but always including the following:
1. The postage shall be prepaid. If, however, the postage on the correspondence mentioned in this article should not be wholly prepaid, the said correspondence shall still be forwarded to the place of destination; but it shall, in that case, beside the deficient postage, be charged with an additional postage, not exceeding four (4) cents in the United States, and six (6) skilling rigsmdnt in Denmark.
2. No packet shall contain any thing which shall be closed against inspection, nor any written communication whatever, except to state from whom and to whom the packet is sent, and the number and price placed upon each pattern or sample of merchandise.
3. No packet may exceed two feet in length, or one foot in any other dimension.

Art ic le IX.

As to the correspondence originating in one country and destined for the other, no account shall take place, and thus the post-office of the United States shall retain the whole amount of postage collected in the United States upon international paid correspondence forwarded to Denmark, and upon international unpaid or insufficiently paid correspondence received from Denmark ; and in like manner the Danish post-office shall retain the whole amount of postage collected in Denmark upon international paid correspondence forwarded to the United States, and upon international unpaid or insufficiently paid correspondence received from the United States.
However, each of the two departments shall be at liberty to claim accounts to be settled when it appears that in one country for one year there is levied twenty per cent more than in the other. If an account is claimed, it shall be regulated on the following basis :
From the total amount of postages and register fees collected by each office on letters, added to the total amount of prepaid postages and register fees on other correspondence which it dispatches, the dispatching office shall deduct the amount required for the conveyance of the mails between the two countries, and the amount of the two net sums shall be equally divided between the two offices.
The deficient and additional postages mentioned in Article VI. shall not be included in the account between the two offices, but, unshared, shall belong to the office by which they are collected.

The two post departments shall establish, by agreement, and in conformity with the arrangements in force at the time, the conditions upon
which the two offices may respectively exchange in open mails the correspondence originating in or destined to other foreign countries to which they may reciprocally serve as intermediaries. It is always understood, however, that such correspondence shall only be charged with the American-Danish rate, augmented by the postage due to foreign countries, or for other exterior service.
It is agreed that the account of this correspondence shall, as to the international postages chargeable on the same, be regulated on the basis jnentioned in the preceding article; but that the amount of the extra national postage, or other tax for exterior service, shall be reciprocally accounted for at full rates. Such charges for paid correspondence to, and for unpaid correspondence from, foreign countries, shall therefore be summarily entered on the respective letter-bills to the credit of the country through which the same is forwarded.

A PROCLAMATION.

The act of Congress, entitled " An act to enforce the provisions of the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and for other purposes," approved April 20, A. D 1871, being a law of extraordinary public importance, I consider it my duty to issue this my proclamation calling the attention of the people of the United States thereto ; enjoining upon all good citizens, and especially upon all public officers, to be zealous in the enforcement thereof, and warning all persons to abstain from committing any of the acts thereby prohibited.
This law of Congress applies to all parts of the United States, and will be enforced everywhere, to the extent of the powers vested in the Executive. But inasmuch as the necessity therefor is well known to have been caused chiefly by persistent violations of the rights of citizens of the United States, by combinations of lawless and disaffected persons in certain localities lately the theatre of insurrection and military conflict, I do particularly exhort the people of those parts of the country to suppress all such combinations by their own voluntary efforts through the agency of local laws, and to maintain the rights of

Fully sensible of the responsibility imposed upon the Executive by the act

known that I will not hesitate to exhaust the powers thus vested in the Execu-

tive, whenever and wherever it shall become necessary to do so for the purpose

of securing to all citizens of the United States the peaceful enjoyment of the

rights guaranteed to them by the Constitution and laws.

It is my earnest wish that peace and cheerful obedience to law may prevail

throughout the land, and that all traces of our late unhappy civil strife may be

speedily removed. These ends can be easily reached by acquiescence in the

results of the conflict, now written in our Constitution, and by the due and

proper enforceluent of equal, just, and impartial laws in every part of our

country.

The failure of local communities to furnish such means for the attainment of

results so earnestly desired imposes upon the National Government the duty of

putting forth all its energies for the protection of its citizens of every race and

color, and for the restoration of peace and order throughout the entire country.

And whereas by said act of Congress it is provided that before the President shall suspend the privileges of the writ of habeas corpus, he shall first have made proclamation commanding such insurgents to disperse;
And whereas on the twelfth day of the present month of October the President of the United States did issue his proclamation, reciting therein, among other things, that such combinations and conspiracies did then exist in the counties of Spartansburg, Fork, Marion, Chester, Laurens, Newberry, Fairfield, Lancaster, and Chesterfield, in the State of South Carolina, and commanding thereby all persons composing such unlawful combinations and conspiracies to disperse and retire peaceably to their homes within five days from the date thereof, and to deliver either to the marshal of the United States for the district of South Carolina, or to any of his deputies, or to any military officer of the United States within said counties, all arms, ammunition, uniforms, disguises, and other means and implements used, kept, possessed, or controlled by them for carrying out the unlawful purposes for which the said combinations and conspiracies are organized ;

The act of Congress, entitled " An act to enforce the provisions of the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and for other purposes," approved April 20, A. D 1871, being a law of extraordinary public importance, I consider it my duty to issue this my proclamation calling the attention of the people of the United States thereto ; enjoining upon all good citizens, and especially upon all public officers, to be zealous in the enforcement thereof, and warning all persons to abstain from committing any of the acts thereby prohibited.
This law of Congress applies to all parts of the United States, and will be enforced everywhere, to the extent of the powers vested in the Executive. But inasmuch as the necessity therefor is well known to have been caused chiefly by persistent violations of the rights of citizens of the United States, by combinations of lawless and disaffected persons in certain localities lately the theatre of insurrection and military conflict, I do particularly exhort the people of those parts of the country to suppress all such combinations by their own voluntary efforts through the agency of local laws, and to maintain the rights of

The National Government to protect citizens and restore peace and order where local communities fail, &c.'

all citizens of the United States, and to secure to all such citizens the equal

protection of the laws.

Fully sensible of the responsibility imposed upon the Executive by the act

of Congress to which public attention is now called, and reluctant to call into

exercise any of the extraordinary powers thereby conferred upon me, except in

cases of imperative necessity, I do, nevertheless, deem it my duty to make

known that I will not hesitate to exhaust the powers thus vested in the Execu-

tive, whenever and wherever it shall become necessary to do so for the purpose

of securing to all citizens of the United States the peaceful enjoyment of the

rights guaranteed to them by the Constitution and laws.

It is my earnest wish that peace and cheerful obedience to law may prevail

throughout the land, and that all traces of our late unhappy civil strife may be

speedily removed. These ends can be easily reached by acquiescence in the

results of the conflict, now written in our Constitution, and by the due and

proper enforceluent of equal, just, and impartial laws in every part of our

country.

The failure of local communities to furnish such means for the attainment of

results so earnestly desired imposes upon the National Government the duty of

putting forth all its energies for the protection of its citizens of every race and

color, and for the restoration of peace and order throughout the entire country.

In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of

the United States to be affixed.

And whereas such unlawful combinations and conspiracies for the purposes aforesaid are declared by the act of Congress aforesaid to be rebellion against the Government of the United States ;
And whereas by said act of Congress it is provided that before the President shall suspend the privileges of the writ of habeas corpus, he shall first have made proclamation commanding such insurgents to disperse;
And whereas on the twelfth day of the present month of October the President of the United States did issue his proclamation, reciting therein, among other things, that such combinations and conspiracies did then exist in the counties of Spartansburg, Fork, Marion, Chester, Laurens, Newberry, Fairfield, Lancaster, and Chesterfield, in the State of South Carolina, and commanding thereby all persons composing such unlawful combinations and conspiracies to disperse and retire peaceably to their homes within five days from the date thereof, and to deliver either to the marshal of the United States for the district of South Carolina, or to any of his deputies, or to any military officer of the United States within said counties, all arms, ammunition, uniforms, disguises, and other means and implements used, kept, possessed, or controlled by them for carrying out the unlawful purposes for which the said combinations and conspiracies are organized ;

The undersigned met this day in order to effect the exchange of the ratifications of the consular convention, signed on the 11th day of December, 1871, between the United States of America and Germany.
Before proceeding to this act, the undersigned Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States of America declared --

2. That, according to the laws and the Constitution of the United States, Article X. applies not only to persons of the male sex but also to persons of the female sex.

Die Unterzeichneten waren heute zusammengetreten, um den Austausch der Ratificationen der am 11. December 1871 unterzeichneten Consular-Convention zwischen den Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika und Deutschland zu bewirken.
Bevor zu diesem Acte geschritten wurde, erklaerte der unterzeichnete ausserordentliche Gesandte und bevollmaechtigte Minister der Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika:
1. Dass nach der ihm von seiner Regierung, nach Vernehmung und mit Zustimmung des Senats ertheilten Instruction, der in dem englischen Texte der Artikel 3 und 9 gebrauchte Ausdruck "property" nur in der Bedeutung von " real estate " gemeint und verstanden
sei; 2. Dass nach den Gesetzen und

A PROCLAMATION.

Thursday, November 30, 1871, recommended to be observed as a day of National Thanksgiving.

The process of the seasons has again enabled the husbandman to garner the

fruits of successful toil. Industry has been generally well rewarded. We are

at peace with all nations, and tranquillity, with few exceptions, prevails at home.

Within the past year we have in the main been free from ills which elsewhere

have afflicted our kind. If some of us have had calamities, these should be an

occasion for sympathy with the sufferers, of resignation on their part to the will

of the Most High, and of rejoicing to the many who have been more favored.

I therefore recommend that, on Thursday, the thirtieth day of November

next, the people meet in their respective places of worship, and there make the

usual annual acknowledgments to Almighty God for .the blessings He has con-

ferred upon them, for their merciful exemption from evils, and invoke His pro-

tection and kindness for their less fortunate brethren, whom, in His wisdom,

He has deemed it best to chastise.

In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of the

United States to be affixed.
