Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America, in Congress assembled, That the President of the United States be, and hereby is, authorized and requested to employ

(a) The decisions of the courts of the United States upon prosecutions for piracy, have been : Piracy.__A robbery committed on the high seas, although such robbery, if committed on land, would
not by the laws of the United States, be punishable with death, is piracy, under the act of Congress of 1790 ; and the circuit courts have jurisdiction thereof. United States v. Palmer, 3 Wheat. 610 ; 4

Cond. Rep. 352. The crime of robbery, as mentioned in the act, is the crime of robbery as recognised and defined at

common law. Ibid.

..

, ,. ,

The crime of robbery, committed by a person who is not a citizen of the United States, on the high

seas, on board of a ship belonging exclusively to subjects of a foreign state, or on persons m a foreign

vessel is not piracy under the act, and is not punishable in the courts of the United States. Ibid.

When a civil war rages in a foreign nation, one part of which separates itself from the old estab-

lished government, and erects itself into a distinct government, the courts of the United States must

view such newly constituted government as it is viewed by the legislative and executive departments of

the government of the United States. If that government remains neutral, but recognises the existence

of a civil war, the courts of the Union cannot consider as criminal, those acts of hostility which war

authorizes, and which the new government may direct against its enemy. Ibid.

The same testimony which would be sufficient to prove that a vessel or person is in the service of

an acknowledged state, is admissible to prove that they are in the service of such newly created gov-

ernment. Its seal cannot be allowed to prove itself, but may be proved by such testimony as the

nature of the case admits; and the fact that a vessel or person is in the service of such government

may be established otherwise, should it be impracticable to prove the seal. Ibid.

A. commission issued by Aury, as " brigadier of the Mexican republic," (a republic whose existence

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America, in Congress assembled, That the President of the United States be, and hereby is, authorized and requested to employ

(a) The decisions of the courts of the United States upon prosecutions for piracy, have been : Piracy.__A robbery committed on the high seas, although such robbery, if committed on land, would
not by the laws of the United States, be punishable with death, is piracy, under the act of Congress of 1790 ; and the circuit courts have jurisdiction thereof. United States v. Palmer, 3 Wheat. 610 ; 4

Cond. Rep. 352. The crime of robbery, as mentioned in the act, is the crime of robbery as recognised and defined at

common law. Ibid.

..

, ,. ,

The crime of robbery, committed by a person who is not a citizen of the United States, on the high

seas, on board of a ship belonging exclusively to subjects of a foreign state, or on persons m a foreign

vessel is not piracy under the act, and is not punishable in the courts of the United States. Ibid.

When a civil war rages in a foreign nation, one part of which separates itself from the old estab-

lished government, and erects itself into a distinct government, the courts of the United States must

view such newly constituted government as it is viewed by the legislative and executive departments of

the government of the United States. If that government remains neutral, but recognises the existence

of a civil war, the courts of the Union cannot consider as criminal, those acts of hostility which war

authorizes, and which the new government may direct against its enemy. Ibid.

The same testimony which would be sufficient to prove that a vessel or person is in the service of

an acknowledged state, is admissible to prove that they are in the service of such newly created gov-

ernment. Its seal cannot be allowed to prove itself, but may be proved by such testimony as the

nature of the case admits; and the fact that a vessel or person is in the service of such government

may be established otherwise, should it be impracticable to prove the seal. Ibid.

A. commission issued by Aury, as " brigadier of the Mexican republic," (a republic whose existence

is unknown and unacknowledged,) or as " generalissimo of the Floridas," (a province in the possession

of Spain,) will not authorize armed vessels to make captures at sea. United States v. Klintock, 5

piratical aggressions and depredations.

employ the public armed vessels to protect merchant ves-
sels.

Query, Whether a person, acting with good faith under such a commission, may be guilty of

piracy? Ibid.

.

However this may be, in general, under the particular circumstances of this case, showing that

the seizure was made not jure belli, but animo furandi, the commission was held not toexemptthe prisoner

from the charge of piracy. Ibid. The act of the 30th of April, 1790, ch. 9, extends to all persons, on board all vessels, which
throw off their national character by cruising piratically, and committing piracy on other vessels. Ibid. The act of the 3rd March, 1819, ch. 77, sec. 5, referring to the law of nations for a definition
of the crime of piracy, is a constitutional exercise of the power of Congress to define and punish that

crime. United States v. Smith, 5 Wheat. 153; 4 Cond. Rep. 619. The crime of piracy is defined by the law of nations with reasonable certainty. Ibid. Robbery, or forcible depredation, upon the sea, animo furandi, is piracy by the law of nations, and

by the act of Congress. Ibid. The eighth section of the act of the 30th of April, 1790, ch. 9, for the punishment of certain crimes
against the United States, is not repealed by the actof the 3d of March, 1819, ch. 77, to protect the commerce of the United States, and to punish the crime of piracy. United States v. Furlong, alias

Hobson et al., 5 Wheat. 184; 4 Cond. Rep. 623. In an indictment for a piratical murder (under the act of the 30th of April, 1790, ch. 9, sec. 8), it
is not necessary that it should allege the prisoner to be a citizen of the United States, nor that the
crime was committed on board a vessel belonging to citizens of the United States; but it is sufficient to
charge it as committed from on board such a vessel, by a mariner sailing on board such a vessel. Ibid. The words " out of the jurisdiction of any particular state," in the act of the 30th of April, 1790,
ch. 9, sec. 8, are construed to mean, out of the jurisdiction of any particular state of the Union. Ibid. A vessel lying in an open roadstead of a foreign country, is " upon the high seas" within the act of

1790, ch. 9, sec. 8. Ibid. A citizen of the United States fitting out a vessel in a port of the United States, to cruise against a
power in amity with the United States, is not protected by a foreign commission from punishment for

any offence committed against the property of citizens of the United States. Ibid. The courts of the United States have jurisdiction of a murder committed on the high seas from a
vessel belonging to the United States, by a foreigner being on board such vessel, upon another foreigner being on board of a foreign vessel. It is not necessary to produce documentary evidence, in

order to prove the national character of a vessel, on an indictment for piracy. Ibid. The courts of the United States have not jurisdiction of a murder committed by one foreigner on

another foreigner, both being on board a foreign vessel. Ibid. It is competent in an indictment for piracy, for the jury to find that a vessel within a marine league
of the shore, at anchor, in an open roadstead, where vessels only ride under shelter of the land at a season when the course of the winds is invariable, is upon the high seas. Ibid.
The act of the 3d of March, 1819, ch. 77, sec. 5, furnishes a sufficient definition of piracy; and it is

defined to be cc robbery on the spas." Ibid. A vessel loses her national character by assuming a piratical character; and a piracy committed by a
foreigner from on board such a vessel, upon any other vessel whatever, is punishable under the eighth

section of the act of the 30th of April, 1790, ch. 9. Ibid. On an indictment for piracy, the jury may find the national character of a vessel upon such evidence
as will satisfy their minds; without the certificate of registry, or other documentary evidence, being produced ; and without proof of their having been seen on board. Ibid.
On an indictment for piracy, the national character of a merchant vessel of the United States maybe proved without evidence of her certificate of registry. Ibid.
The courts of the United States have jurisdiction under the act of the 30th of April, 1790, ch. 9, of murder or robbery committed on the high seas ; although not committed on board a vessel belonging to citizens of the United States, as if she had no national character; but was held by pirates, or persons not lawfully sailing under the flag of any foreign nation. United States v. Holmes, 5 Wheat. 412; 4 Cond. Rep. 708.
In the same case, and under the same act, if the offence be committed on board of a foreign vessel by a citizen of the United States ; or on board a vessel of the United States by a foreigner ; or by a citizen or foreigner on board of a piratical vessel; the offence is equally cognisable by the courts of the United States. Ibid.
It makes no difference in such a case, and under the same act, whether the offence was committed on board of a vessel, or on the sea; as by throwing the deceased overboard and drowning him, or by shooting him when in the sea though he was not thrown overboard. Ibid.
In such a case, and under the same act, where the vessel from on board of which the offence was committed, sailed from Buenos Ayres, where she had enlisted her crew; but it did not appear by legal proof that she had a commission from the government of Buenos Ayres, or any ships' papers or documents from that government, or that she was ever recognised as a ship of that nation, or of its subjects, or who were the owners, where they resided, or when or where the vessel was armed and equipped ; but it did appear in proof, that the captain and crew were chiefly Englishmen, Frenchmen, and citizens

of the United States; that the captain was by birth a citizen of the United States, domiciled at Baltimore, where the privateer was built: Held, that the burthen of proof of the national character of the vessel, was on the prisoners. Ibid.

General piracy, or murder, or robbery, committed by persons on board a vessel, not at the time belonging to the subjects of any foreign power, but in possession of a crew, acting in defiance of all

law, and acknowledging obedience to no government whatever, is within the 8th section of the ac

of Congress of April 30th, 1790, ch. 9, and is punishable in the courts of the United States. United
States v. Furlong, 5 Wheat. 185; 4 Cond. Rep. 623. There is a distinction between the crimes of murder and piracy. The latter is an offence within the
criminal jurisdiction of all nations : not so with murder, it is punishable under the laws of each state.

Ibid. It is not necessary to produce documentary evidence, to prove the national character of a vessel, on

an indictment for piracy. Ibid. Upon a piratical capture, the property of the original owners cannot be forfeited for the misconduct
of the captors, in violating the municipal laws of the country where the captors have carried the pro-
perty. The Josefa Segunda, 5 Wheat. 338 ; 4 Cond. Rep. 672. Pirates may be lawfully captured by the public or private ships of any nation, in peace or in war;
for they are hostes humani generis. The Marianna Flora, 11 Wheat. 1 ; 6 Cond. Rep. 201. On a question of probable cause of seizure, under the piracy acts of 3d of March, 1819, ch. 77, and
of the 15th of May, 1820, ch. 113 ; although the crew maybe protected by a commission bona fide received, and acted under, from the consequences attaching to the offence of piracy by the general law of nations ; although such commission was irregularly issued ; yet if the defects in the commission be such as, connected with the insubordination and predatory spirit of the crew, to excite a justly founded suspicion, it is sufficient, under the act of Congress, to justify the captors for bringing in the vessel for adjudication, and to exempt them from costs and damages. The Palmyra, 12 Wheat. 1; 6 Cond. Rep. 397.
Whatever difficultv there may be, under our municipal institutions, in punishing as pirates, citizens of the United States"who take from a state at war with Spain, a commission to cruise against that power, contrary to the 14th article of the Spanish treaty: yet there is no doubt that such acts are to be considered as piratical acts for all civil purposes, and the offending parties cannot appear, and claim in our courts the property thus taken. The Bello Corrunes, 6 Wheat. 152; 5 Cond. Rep. 45.
To constitute the offence of piracy, within the act of 1790, ch. 9, by "piratically and feloniously" running away with a vessel, personal force and violence is not necessary. United States v. Tully, 1

Gallis. C. C. R. 247.

, . ,. ,

.,

The " piratically and feloniously" running away with a vessel, within the act, is the running away

with a vessel, with an intent to convert the same to the taker's own use, against the will of the owner.

The intent must be animo furandi. Ibid. The circuit court has cognisance, under the act of 1790, ch. 9, sec. 8, of piracy on board an Ameri-
can ship, although committed in an open roadstead, adjacent to a foreign territory, and within half a
mile of the shore. United States v. Ross, 1 Gallis. C. C. R. 524. Where the defendant was indicted for robbery and piracy, on the high seas, on board a brig called
L'Eclair, a foreign vessel,belonging exclusively to French owners, and sailing under the French flag: Held, that under the acts of Congress, the circuit court had no jurisdiction to try and punish the offence.

United States v. Kessler, 1 Baldwin's C. C. R. 25. Whether the offence was committed within or without a marine league of the coast of the United

States, makes no difference. Ibid.

.

The defendant who was the first lieutenant of an American privateer, the Revenge, was indicted for

piracy committed on a Portuguese vessel, and for assaulting the crew, and putting them in bodily fear,

&c. The defendant was charged with boarding the vessel, and by force and intimidation, taking from

her money and other articles, not claiming the vessel as prize ; but pretending that, the Revenge was

an English vessel, and that the articles would be paid for by an order on the English consul. Held,

that the eighth section of the act for the punishment of certain crimes, makes murder and robbery on

the high seas acts of piracy. The words, " which if committed in the body of a county," do not

relate to "murderand robbery," but to the words immediately preceding them, or any other offence.

United States v. Jones, 3 Wash. C. C. R. 209. To define the meaning of " robbery," the common law must be resorted to: wherever a statute of
the United States uses a technical term, which is known, and its meaning clearly ascertained by the common law or civil law, from one or other of which it is obviously borrowed, it is proper to refer for

its meaning to the source from which it is taken. Ibid. The act of Congress of 1812, for the government of the navy of the United States, does not repeal
the provisions of the law relating to piracy, contained in the act of Congress passed 30th April, 1790.
The general rule of law, that robbery on the high seas is piracy, has no exception or qualification in favour of commissioned privateers, in any act of Congress, in the common law, or in the law of nations.
Robbery is the felonious taking of goods from the person of another ; or in his presence by violence ;

or by putting him in fear, and against his will. Ibid. As there was no proof under the indictment, that in the first instance any unlawful acts were medi-
tated by the commander of the Revenge, and his officers; it was held to be insufficient to charge the defendants, who were part of the crew, with piracy, by proving acts of robbery committed by the crew in general It must be proved that the defendants, who were part of the crew, participated in the taking ; and that they did it feloniously. The captain of the Revenge may have been guilty of robbery,

and those who executed his orders may have been innocent. Ibid. The crimes of piracy mentioned in the 8th section of the act for the punishment of certain crimes,
nassed 30th April, 1790, are such as are committed by citizens of the United States, or on board of
vessels of the United States; and the 10th and 11th sections of the act, which refer to accessaries, refer to acts of piracy mentioned in the 8th section. United States v. Howard et al., 3 Wash. C. C. R.

340. An endeavour by a mariner to corrupt the master of a vessel, and to induce him to go over to pirates,

is within the provisions of the eighth section of the law. Ibid.

boat, the crew whereof shall be armed, and which shall have attempted or committed any piratical aggression, search, restraint, depredation or seizure, upon any vessel of the United States, or of the citizens thereof, or
upon any other vessel; and also to retake any vessel of the United States, or its citizens, which may have been unlawfully captured upon the
high seas. Sec . 3. And be it further enacted, That the commander and crew of
any merchant vessel of the United States, owned wholly, or in part,
by a citizen thereof, may oppose and defend against any aggression, search, restraint, depredation, or seizure, which shall be attempted upon such vessel, or upon any other vessel owned as aforesaid by the commander or crew of any armed vessel whatsoever, not being a public armed vessel of some nation in amity with the United States ; and may subdue and capture the same; and may also retake any vessel, owned as aforesaid, which may have been captured by the commander or crew of any such armed vessel, and send the same into any port of the United States.
Sec . 4. And be it further enacted, That whenever any vessel or boat, from which any piratical aggression, search, restraint, depredation or seizure shall have been first attempted or made, shall be captured and brought into any port of the United States, the same shall and may be adjudged and condemned to their use, and that of the captors, after due process and trial, in any court having admiralty jurisdiction, and which shall be holden for the district into which such captured vessel shall be brought; and the same court shall thereupon order a sale and distribution thereof accordingly, and at their discretion.
Sec . 5. And be it further enacted, That if any person or persons whatsoever, shall, on the high seas, commit the crime of piracy, as defined

send into port armed vessels, &c. which have attempted or committed piratical aggression, &c.
Merchant vessels may defend against aggression, &c. by any armed vessel other than a public armed vessel of a nation in amity-
Vessels from which piratical aggression, &c. has been attempted or made, when taken may be condemned.
Sale and distribution.

To establish the crime of confederacy, there must be some proof of criminal intentions in the
persons charged. Ibid.
The language of the 12th section of the law, implies compact and association with pirates, as well in relation to the past as to the future. Any intercourse with them which is calculated to promote
their views, is within the provisions of the law. Ibid.
In order to affect all the officers and crew of a piratical vessel with guilt, the original voyage must have been undertaken with a piratical design ; and the officers and crew have acted upon such design;
otherwise those only are guilty who co-operated actively in the piracy. United States v. Gibert,
2 Sumner's C. C. R. 19.
It would not be sufficient to affect them with such, if they had known the voyage was to be an illegal
one, as in the slave trade, contrary to the laws of Spain. Ibid.
The simple fact of presence on board the piratical vessel, where there was no original piratical design, is not of itself sufficient to affect a party with the crime. All who are present, acting and assist-
ing in the piracy, are to be deemed principals. Ibid.
The act of 1790, ch. 9, sec. 8, for the punishment of certain crimes, passed by Congress, as well as the act of 1820, ch. 113, applies to all murders androbberies committed on board of, or upon American
ships on the high seas. Ibid.
The indictment charged the piracy to have been committed {on the high seas within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States, and out of the jurisdiction of a particular state."
Held, that this was a sufficient statement of the venue,'without a further specification of the place.
Ibid.
Under the act of Congress of 1819, ch. 77, any armed vessel may be seized which shall have attempt-
ed or committed any piratical aggression, &c., and the proceeds of the vessel when sold divided between
the United States and the captors at the discretion of the court. Harmony et al, v. The United States,
2 Howard, 210.
It is no matter whether the vessel be armed for offence or defence, provided she commits the unlawful
acts specified. Ibid.
To bring a vessel within the act, it is not necessary that there should be actual plunder or intent to plunder ; if the act be committed from hatred or an abuse of power, or a spirit of mischief, it is suffi-
cient. Ibid.
The word " piratical" in the act is not to be limited in its construction to such acts as by the laws
of nations are denominated piracy, but includes such as pirates are in the habit of committing. Ibid.
A piratical aggression, search, restraint or seizure, is as much within the act, as a piratical depreda-
tion. Ibid.
The innocence or ignorance on the part of the owner of the vessel, of these prohibited acts, will
not exempt the vessel from condemnation. Ibid.
The condemnation of the cargo is not authorized by the act of 1819. Neither does the law of nations require the condemnation of the cargo for petty offences, unless the owner thereof co-operates in and
authorizes the unlawful act. An exception exists in the enforcement of belligerent rights. Ibid.
Where the innocence of the owners was established, it was proper to throw the costs on the vessel
which was condemned, to the exception of the cargo which was liberated. Ibid.

Whe rea s a greater part of the Cherokee nation have expressed an earnest desire to remain on this side of the Mississippi, and being desirous, in order to commence those measures which they deem necessary to the civilization and preservation of their nation, that the treaty between the United States and them, signed the eighth of July, eighteen hundred and seventeen, might, without further delay, or the trouble or expense of taking the census, as stipulated in the said treaty, be finally adjusted, have offered to cede to the United States a tract of country at least as extensive as that which they probably are entitled to under its provisions, the contracting parties have agreed to and concluded the following articles.
Art . 1. The Cherokee nation cedes to the United States all of their lands lying north and east of the following line, viz : Beginning on the Tennessee river, at the point where the Cherokee boundary with Madison county, in the Alabama territory, joins the same; thence, along the main channel of said river, to the mouth of the Highwassee; thence, along its main channel, to the first hill which closes in on said river, about two miles above Highwassee Old Town; thence, along the ridge which divides the waters of the Highwassee and Little Tellico, to the Tennessee river, at Tallassee; thence, along the main channel, to the junction of the Cowee and Nanteyalee; thence, along the ridge in the fork of said river, to the top of the Blue Ridge; thence, along the Blue Ridge, to the Unicoy Turnpike Road; thence, by a straight line, to the nearest main source of the Chestatee; thence, along its main channel, to the Chatahouchee; and thence to the Creek boundary; it being understood that all the islands in the Chestatee, and the parts of the Tennessee and Highwassee, (with the exception of Jolly's Island, in the

The reservations are made on the condition, that those for whom they are intended shall notify, in writing, to the agent for the Cherokee nation, within six months after the ratification of this treaty, that it is their intention to continue to reside permanently on the land reserved.

TREATY OF AMITY, SETTLEMENT, AND LIMITS,

Feb. 22, 1819. Oct. 29,1820.
Ratified by the United States, Feb. 19, 1821. Ratified by the King of Spain, Oct. 24, 1820. Mutual desire to consolidate friendship, &c.

Between the United States of America and his Catholic
Majesty. (a)
The United States of America and his Catholic Majesty, desiring to consolidate, on a permanent basis, the friendship and good correspondence which happily prevails between the two parties, have determined to settle and terminate all their differences and pretensions, by a Treaty, which shall designate, with precision, the limits of their respective bordering territories in North America.

(a) See notes of the treaties with Spain, ante, page 138. An act for carrying into execution the treaty between the United States and Spain, concluded at Washington on the twenty-second day of February, 1819. March 3, 1821, vol. 3, p. 637. The decisions of the Supreme Court, in cases arising under this treaty, have been: By the treaty of St. Ildcfonso, made on the first of October, 1800, Spain ceded Louisiana to France ; and France, by the treaty of Paris, signed the 30th of April, 1803, ceded it to the United States. Under this treaty, the United States claimed the countries between the Iberville and the Perdido. Spain contended that her cession to France comprehended only that territory, which, at the time of the cession, was denominated Louisiana, consisting of the island of New Orleans, and the country which had been originally ceded to her by France, west of the Mississippi. The land claimed by the plaintiffs in error, under a grant from the crown of Spain, made after the treaty of St. Ildefonso, lies within the disputed territory ; and this case presents the question, to whom did the country between the Iberville and Perdido belong after the treaty of St. Ildefonso ? Had France and Spain agreed upon the boundaries of the retroceded territory, before Louisiana wrns acquired by the United States, that agreement would undoubtedly have ascertained its limits. But the declarations of France, made after parting with the province, cannot be admitted as conclusive. In questions of this character, political considerations have too much influence over the conduct of nations, to permit their declarations to decide the course of an independent government, in a matter vitally interesting to itself. Foster et al. v. Neilson, 2 Peters, 306. If a Spanish grantee had obtained possession of the land in dispute, so as to be the defendant, would a court of the United States maintain his title under a Spanish grant, made subsequent to the acquisition of Louisiana, singly on the principle that the Spanish construction of the treaty of St. Ildefonso was right, and the American construction wrong ? Such a decision would subvert those principles which govern the relations between the legislative and judicial departments, and mark the limits of each. Ibid. 309. The sound construction of the 8th article of the treaty between the United States and Spain, of the 22d of February, 1829, will not enable the court to apply its provisions to the case of the plaintiff. Ibid. 314. The article does not declare that all the grants made by his Catholic majesty, before the 24th of January, 1818, shall be valid to the same extent as if the ceded territories had remained under his dominion. It does not say that those grants are hereby confirmed. Had such been its language, it would have acted directly on the subject, and it would have repealed those acts of congress which were repugnant to it; but its language is that those grants shall be ratified and confirmed to the persons in possession, &c. By whom shall they be ratified and confirmed? This seems to be the language of contract; and if it is, the ratification and confirmation which are promised, must be the act of the legislature. Until such act shall be passed, the court is not at liberty to disregard the existing laws on the subject. Ibid. By the treaty by which Louisiana was acquired, the United States stipulated that the inhabitants of the ceded territories should be protected in the free enjoyment of their property. The United States, as a just nation, regard this stipulation as the avowal of a principle which would have been held equally sacred, although it had not been inserted in the treaty. Soulard et al. v. The United States, 4 Peters, 511. The term property, as applied to lands, comprehends every species of title, inchoate or complete. It is supposed to embrace those rights which lie in contract; those which are executory, as well as those which are executed. In this respect, the relation of the inhabitants of Louisiana to their government, is not changed. The new government takes the place of that which has passed away. Ibid. The stipulations of the treaty ceding Louisiana to the United States, affording that protection or security to claims under the French or Spanish government to which the act of congress refers, are in the first, second and third articles. They extended to all property, until Louisiana became a member of the Union ; into which the inhabitants were to be incorporated as soon as possible, " and admitted to all the rights, advantages and immunities of citizens of the United States." The perfect inviolability and security of property is among these rights. Delassus v. The United States, 9 Peters, 117. The right of property is protected and secured by the treaty, and no principle is better settled in this country, than that an inchoate title to lands is property. This right would have been sacred, independent of the treaty. The sovereign who acquires an inhabited country, acquires full dominion over it;

TRATADO DE AMISTAD, ARREGLO DE DIFERENCIAS Y LIMITES,
Entre S. M. Ca. y los Estados Unidos de America.

Des ea nd o S. M. Catolica y los Estados Unidos de America consolidar, de un modo permanente, la buena correspondencia y amistad que felizmente reyna entre ambas partes, han resuelto transigir y terminal todas sus diferencias y pretensiones por medio de un Tratado, que fixe, con precision, los limites de sus respectivos y confinantes territorios en la America Septentrional.

but this dominion is never supposed to divest the vested rights of individuals to property. The language of the treaty ceding Louisiana, excludes any idea of interfering with private property. Ibid.
After the acquisition of Florida by the United States, in virtue of the treaty with Spain, of 22d of February, 1819, various acts of congress were passed for the adjustment of private land claims, within the ceded territory. The tribunals authorized to decide on them, were not authorized to settle any which exceeded aleague square; on those exceeding that quantity, they were directed to report, especially, their opinion, for the future action of congress. The lands embraced in the larger claims were defined by surveys, and plats retained; these were reserved from sale, and remained unsettled until some resolution should be adopted for a final adjudication of them, which was done by the passage of the law of the 22d May, 1828. By the sixth section, it was provided, " that all claims to land within the territory of Florida, embraced by the treaty, which shall not be finally decided and settled under the provisions of the same law, containing a greater quantity of land than the commissioners were authorized to decide, and above the amount confirmed by the act, and which have not been reported as antedated, or forged, shall be received and adjudicated by the judges of the superior court of the district in which the land lies, upon the petition of the claimant, according to the forms, rules and regulations, conditions, restrictions and regulations prescribed to the district judge, and to the claimants, by the act of 26th May, 1824." By a proviso, all claims annulled by the treaty, and all claims not presented to the commissioners, &c., according to the acts of congress, were excluded. United States v. Arredondo et al. 6 Peters, 706.
The validity of concessions of land, by the authorities of Spain, in East Florida, is expressly recognised in the Florida treaty, and in the several acts of congress. Ibid.
The eighth article allows the owners of land the same time for fulfilling the conditions of their grants from the date of the treaty, as is allowed in the grant from the date of the instrument. And the act of the 8th of May, 1822, requires every person claiming title to lands under any patent, grant, concession, or order of survey dated previous to the 24th of January, 1818, to file his claim before the commissioners appointed in pursuance of that act. All the subsequent acts on the subject observe the same language ; and the titles under these concessions have been uniformly confirmed, when the tract did not exceed a league square. Ibid.
A claim to lands in East Florida, the title to which was derived from grants by the Creek and Seminole Indians, ratified by the local authorities of Spain, before the cession of Florida by Spain to the United States was confirmed. It was objected to the title claimed in this case, which had been presented to the superior court of Middle Florida, under the provisions of the acts of Congress for the settlement of land claims in Florida, that the grantees did not acquire, under the Indian grants, a legal title to the land, Held, that the acts of congress submit these claims to the adjudication of this court as a court of equity ; and those acts, as often and uniformly construed in its repeated decisions, confer the same jurisdiction over imperfect, inchoate, and inceptive titles, as legal and perfect ones, and require the court to decide by the same rules on all claims submitted to it, whether legal or equitable. Mitchell et al. v. The United States, 9 Peters, 711.
Under the Florida treaty, grants of land made before the 24th January, 1818, by his Catholic Majesty, or by his lawful authorities, stand ratified and confirmed to the same extent that the same grants would be valid, if Florida had remained under the dominion of Spain; and the owners of conditional grants, who have been prevented from fulfilling all the conditions of their grants, have time by the treaty extended to them to complete such conditions. That time, as was declared by the supreme court in Arredondo's case, 6 Peters, 478, began to run in regard to individual rights from the ratification of the treaty ; and the treaty declares, if the conditions are not complied with, within the terms limited in the grant, that the grants shall be null and void. United States v. Kingsley, 12 Peters, 476.
The treaty with Spain, by which Florida was ceded to the United States, is the law of the land, and admits the inhabitants of Florida to the enjoyment of the privileges, rights, and immunities of the citizens of the United States. They do not, however, participate in political power; they do not share in the government, until Florida shall become a state. In the mean time, Florida continues to be a territory of the United States, governed by virtue of that clause in the constitution, which empowers " congress to make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory, or other property, belonging to the United States."

TREATY WITH SPAIN. 1819.

John Quincy Adams and Luis De Onis, negotiators. Full powers exchanged.

With this intention, the President of the United States has furnished with their full powers John Qui ncy Adam s , Secretary of State of the said United States; and his Catholic Majesty has appointed the most excellent Lord Don Luis De Onis , Gonzales, Lopez y Vara, Lord of the town of Rayaces, perpetual Regidor of the Corporation of the City of Salamanca, Knight Grand-Cross of the Royal American Order of Isabella the Catholic, decorated with the Lys of La Vendee, Knight Pensioner of the Royal and distinguished Spanish Order of Charles the Third, Member of the Supreme Assembly of the said Royal Order, of the Council of his Catholic Majesty; his Secretary, with Exercise of Decrees, and his Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary near the United States of America.
And the said Plenipotentiaries, after having exchanged their powers, have agreed upon and concluded the following articles:

Firm and inviolable peace and friendship.

ARTICLE 1. There shall be a firm and inviolable peace and sincere friendship between the United States and their citizens, and his Catholic Majesty, his successors and subjects, without exception of persons or places.

His Catholic Majesty cedes the Floridas. What things are included in the cession.

ARTICLE 2. His Catholic Majesty cedes to the United States, in full property and sovereignty, all the territories which belong to him, situated to the eastward of the Mississippi, known by the name of East and West Florida. The adjacent islands dependent on said provinces, all public lots and squares, vacant lands, public edifices, fortifications, barracks, and other buildings, which are not private property, archives and documents, which relate directly to the property and sovereignty of said provinces, are included in this article. The said archives and documents shall be left in possession of the commissaries or officers of the United States, duly authorized to receive them.

ARTICLE 3. The. boundary line between the two countries, west of the Mississippi, shall begin on the Gulph of Mexico, at the mouth of the river Sabine,

The object of the treaty with Spain, which ceded Florida to the United States, dated 22d May, 1819, was to invest the commissioners with full power and authority to receive, examine, and decide upon the amount and validity of asserted claims upon Spain, for damages and injuries. Their decision, within the scope of this authority, is conclusive and final, and is not re-examinable. The parties must abide by it, as the decree of a competent tribunal of exclusive jurisdiction. A rejected claim cannot be brought again under review, in any judicial tribunal. But it does not naturally follow that this authority extends to adjust all conflicting rights of different citizens to the fund so awarded. The commissioners are to look to the original claim for damages and injuries against Spain itself; and it is wholly immaterial who is the legal or equitable owner of the claim, provided he is an American citizen. Comegys et al. v. Vasse, 1 Peters, 212.
After the validity and amount of the claim has been ascertained by the award of the commissioners, the rights of the claimant to the fund, which has passed into his hands and those of others, are left to the ordinary course of judicial proceedings in the established courts of justice. Ibid.
The treaty with Spain recognised an existing right in the aggrieved parties to compensation ; and did not, in the most remote degree, turn upon the notion of donation or gratuity. It was demanded by our government as matter of right, and as such was granted by Spain. Ibid. 217.
The right to compensation from Spain, held under abandonment made to underwriters, and accepted by them, for damages and injuries, which were to be satisfied under the treaty, by the United States; passed to the assignees of the bankrupt, who held such rights by the provisions of the bankrupt law of the United States, passed April 4, 1800. Ibid.
The king of Spain was the grantor in the Florida treaty ; the treaty was his deed; the exception was made by him; and its nature and effect depended on his intention, expressed by his words, in reference to the thing granted, and the thing reserved and excepted in the grant. The Spanish version was in his words, ana expressed his intention ; and although the American version showed the intention to be different, the supreme court cannot adopt it as a rule to decide what was granted, what excepted, and what reserved. United States v. Arredondo et al., 6 Peters, 741.
Even in cases of conquest, it is very unusual for the conqueror to do more than to displace the sovereign and assume dominion over the country. The modern usage of nations, which has become law, would be violated; that sense of justice and of right, which is acknowledged and felt by the whole civilized world, would be outraged ; if private property should be generally confiscated, and private rights annulled, on a change in the sovereignty of the country by the Florida treaty. The people change their allegiance, their relation to their ancient sovereign is dissolved; but their relations to each other, and their rights of

Y ambos Plenipotenciarios, despues de haver cangeado sus Poderes, han ajustado y firmado los articulos siguientes:
ART. 1. Habra una paz solida e inviolable y una amistad sincera entre S. M. Ca- sus sucesores y subditos, y los Estados Unidos y sus ciudadanos, sin excepcion de personas ni lugares.
ART. 2. S. M. O cede a los Estados Unidos, en toda propiedad y soberania, todos los territories que le pertenecen, situados al Este del Misisipi, conocidos bajo el nombre de Florida Occidental y Florida Oriental. Son comprehendidos en este articulo las yslas adyacentes dependientes de dichas dos provincias, los sitios, plazas publicas, terrenes valdios, edificios publicos, fortificaciones, casernas y otros edificios, que no sean propiedad de algun individuo particular, los archives y documentos directamente relatives a la propiedad y soberania de las mismas dos provincias. Dichos archives y documentos se entregaran a los comisarios u oficiales de los Estados Unidos debidamente autorizados para recibirlos.
ART. 3. La linea divisoria entre los dos paises al occidente del Misisipi, arrancara del Seno Mexicano, en la embodacura del Rio Sabina, en el Mar,
property, remain undisturbed. Had Florida changed its sovereign by an act containing no stipulation respecting the property of individuals, the right of property in all those who became subjects or citizens of the new government, would have been unaffected by the change. It would have remained the same as under the ancient sovereign. United States v. Percheman, 7 Peters, 51.
The language of the second article of the treaty between the United States and Spain, of 22d February 1819, by which Florida was ceded to the United States, conforms to this general principle. Ibid.
The eighth article of the treaty must be intended to stipulate expressly for the security to private property, which the laws and usages of nations would, without express stipulation, have conferred. No construction which would impair that security, further than its positive words require, would seem to be admissible. Without it, the titles of individuals would remain as valid under the new government, as they were under the old. And those titles, so far at least as they were consummated, might be asserted in the courts of the United States, independently of this article. Ibid.
The treaty was drawn up in the Spanish as well as in the English languages. Both are original, and were unquestionably intended by the parties to be identical. The Spanish has been translated; and it is now understood that the article expressed in that language is, that "the grants shall remain ratified and confirmed to the persons in possession of them, to the same extent," &c., thus conforming exactly to the universally received law of nations. Ibid.
If the English and Spanish part can, without violence, be made to agree, that construction which establishes this conformity ought to prevail. Ibid.
No violence is done to the language of the treaty by a construction which conforms the English and Spanish to each other. Although the words "shall be ratified and confirmed," are properly words of contract, stipulating for some future legislation, they are not necessarily so. They may import that "they shall be ratified and confirmed" by force of the instrument itself. When it is observed that in the counterpart of the same treaty, executed at the same time, by the same parties, they are used in this sense, the construction is proper, if not unavoidable. Ibid.
In the case of Foster v. Neilson, 2 Peters, 253, the supreme court considered those words importing a contract. The Spanish part of the treaty was not then brought into view, and it was then supposed there was no variance between them. It was not supposed that there was even a formal difference of expression in the same instrument, drawn up in the language of each party. Had this circumstance been known, it is believed it would have produced the construction which is now given to the article. Ibid.

TREATY WITH SPAIN. 1819.

Boundary line west of the Mississippi. According to Melish's Map, of 1st Jan. 1818.
The use of the waters of the Sabine, Red river, and Arkansas, common to both nations.

in the sea, continuing north, along the western bank of that river, to the 32d degree of latitude; thence, by a line due north, to the degree of latitude where it strikes the Rio Roxo of Nachitoches, or Red River; then following the course of the Rio Roxo westward, to the degree of longitude 100 west from London and 23 from Washington; then, crossing the said Red River, and running thence, by a line due north, to the river Arkansas; thence, following the course of the southern bank of the Arkansas, to its source, in latitude 42 north; and thence, by that parallel of latitude, to the South Sea. The whole being as laid down in Melish's map of the United States, published at Philadelphia, improved to the first of January, 1818. But, if the source of the Arkansas river shall be found to fall north or south of latitude 42, then the line shall run from the said source due south or north, as the case may be, till it meets the said parallel of latitude 42, and thence, along the said parallel, to the South Sea: All the islands in the Sabine, and the said Red and Arkansas rivers, throughout the course thus described, to belong to the United States; but the use of the waters, and the navigation of the Sabine to the sea, and of the said rivers Roxo and Arkansas, throughout the extent of the said boundary, on their respective banks, shall be common to the respective inhabitants of both nations.

Territorial renunciations, corresponding with the boundary line.

The two high contracting parties agree to cede and renounce all their rights, claims, and pretensions, to the territories described by the said line; that is to say: the United States hereby cede to his Catholic Majesty, and renounce forever, all their rights, claims, and pretensions, to the territories lying west and south of the above-described line; and, in like manner, his Catholic Majesty cedes to the said United States, all his rights, claims, and pretensions, to any territories east and north of the said line; and for himself, his heirs, and successors, renounces all claim to the said territories forever.

A commissioner and surveyor to be appointed by each party, to run the boundary line.

ARTICLE 4. To fix this line with more precision, and to place the landmarks which shall designate exactly the limits of both nations, each of the contracting parties shall appoint a Commissioner and a Surveyor, who shall meet before the termination of one year, from the date of the ratification of this treaty, at Nachitoches, on the Red River, and proceed to run and mark the said line, from the mouth of the Sabine to the Red river, and from the Red river to the river Arkansas, and to ascertain the latitude of the source of the said river Arkansas, in conformity to what is above agreed upon and stipulated, and the line of latitude 42, to the South Sea: they shall make out plans, and keep journals of their proceedings, and the result agreed upon by them shall be considered as part of this treaty, and shall have the same force as if it were inserted therein. The two governments will amicably agree respecting the necessary articles to be furnished to those persons, and also as to their respective escorts, should such be deemed necessary.

Free exercise of religion in the ceded territories, &c.

ARTICLE 5. The inhabitants of the ceded territories shall be secured in the free exercise of their religion, without any restriction; and all those who may desire to remove to the Spanish dominions, shall be permitted to sell or export their effects, at any time whatever, without being subject, in either case, to duties.

Inhabitants of

Todo segun el Mapa de los Estados Unidos de Melish, publicado en Philadelphia, y perfecionado en 1818. Pero si el nacimiento del Rio Arkansas se hallase al Norte 6 Sur de dicho grado 42 de latitud, seguira la linea desde el origen de dicho Rio recta al Sur 6 Norte, segun fuese necesario, hasta que encuentre el expresado grado 42 de latitud, y desde, alii por el mismo paralelo, hasta el Mar del Sur. Perteneceran a los Estados Unidos todas las yslas de los Rios Sabina, Roxo de Natchitochez, y Arkansas, en la extension de todo el curso descrito; pero el uso de las aguas, y la navegacion del Sabina hasta el Mar, y de los expresados Rios Roxo y Arkansas, en toda la extension de sus mencionados limites, en sus respectivas orillas, sera comun a los habitantes de las dos naciones.
Las dos altas partes contratantes convienen en ceder y renunciar todos sus derechos, reclamaciones, y pretensiones, sobre los territorios que se describen en esta linea; a saber, S. M. Ca- renuncia y cede, para siempre, por si, y a nombre de sus lierederos y sucesores, todos los derechos que tiene sobre los territorios al Este y al Norte de dicha linea; y los Estados Unidos, en igual forma, ceden a S. M. Ca- y renuncian, para a siempre, todos sus derechos, reclamaciones, y pretensiones, a qualesquiera territorios situados al Oeste y al Sur de la misma linea arriba descrita.

ART. 4.

Para fixar esta linea con mas precision y establecer los mojones que senalen con exactitud los limites de ambas naciones, nombrara. cada una de ellas un comisario y un geometra, que se juntaran antes del termino de un ano, contado desde la fecha de la ratificacion de este Tratado, en Natchitochez, en las orillas del Rio Roxo, y procederan a senalar y demarcar dicha linea, desde la embocadura del Sabina, hasta el Rio Roxo, y de este hasta el Rio Arkansas, y a averiguar, con certidumbre, el origen del expresado Rio Arkansas, y fixar, segun queda estipulado y convenido en este Tratado, la linea que debe seguir, desde el grado 42 de latitud, hasta el Mar Pacifico. Lievaran diarios y levantaran pianos de sus operaciones, y el resultado convenido por ellos se tendra por parte de este Tratado, y tendra la misma fuerza que si estuviese inserto in el; deviendo convenir amistosamente los dos gobiernos en el arreglo de quanto necesiten estos individuos, y en la escolta respectiva que deban llevar, siempre que se crea necesario.

ART. 5.
A los habitantes de todos los territorios cedidos se les conservara el exercicio libre de su religion, sin restriccion alguna; y a todos los que quisieren trasladarse a los dominios Espanoles, se les permitira la venta 6 extraccion de sus efectos en qualquiera tiempo, sin que pueda exigirseles en uno ni otro caso derecho alguno.

TREATY WITH SPAIN. 1819.

Spanish troops to be withdrawn, and possession given within 6 months after exchange of ratifications.

of the Federal Constitution, and admitted to the enjoyment of all the privileges, rights, and immunities, of the citizens of the United States.
ARTICLE 7. The officers and troops of his Catholic Majesty, in the territories hereby ceded by him to the United States, shall be withdrawn, and possession of the places occupied by them shall be given within six months after the exchange of the ratifications of this Treaty, or sooner, if possible, by the officers of his Catholic Majesty, to the commissioners or officers of the United States, duly appointed to receive them; and the United States shall furnish the transports and escort necessary to convey the Spanish officers and troops, and their baggage, to the Havana.

Grants of land before 24th Jan. 1818, confirmed, &c.
Owners to fulfil the conditions.
Grants since 24th Jan. 1818, null and void.

ARTICLE 8. All the grants of land made before the 24th of January, 1818, by his Catholic Majesty, or by his lawful authorities, in the said territories ceded by his Majesty to the United States, shall be ratified and confirmed to the persons in possession of the lands, to the same extent that the same grants would be valid if the territories had remained under the dominion of his Catholic Majesty. But the owners in possession of such lands, who, by reason of the recent circumstances of the Spanish nation, and the revolutions in Europe, have been prevented from fulfilling all the conditions of their grants, shall complete them within the terms limited in the same, respectively, from the date of this treaty; in default of which, the said grants shall be null and void. All grants made since the said 24th of January, 1818, when the first proposal, on the part of his Catholic Majesty, for the cession of the Floridas, was made, are hereby declared, and agreed to be, null and void.

Reciprocal renunciation of claims.
Claims renounced by the United States.

ARTICLE 9. The two high contracting parties, animated with the most earnest desire of conciliation, and with the object of putting an end to all the differences which have existed between them, and of confirming the good understanding which they wish to be forever maintained between them, reciprocally renounce all claims for damages or injuries which they, themselves, as well as their respective citizens and subjects, may have suffered until the time of signing this Treaty. The renunciation of the United States will extend to all the injuries mentioned in the Convention of the 11th of August, 1802. 2.

[Here follows the above Treaty, word for word.]

" Therefore, having seen and examined the sixteen articles aforesaid, and having first obtained the
consent and authority of the General Cortes of the nation with respect to the cession mentioned and stipulated in the 2d and 3d articles,
I approve and ratify all and every one of the articles referred to, and the clauses which are contained in
them; and, in virtue of these presents, I approve and ratify them ; promising, on the faith and word of a King, to execute and observe them, and to cause them to be executed and observed entirely as if I myself had signed them : and that
the circumstance of having exceeded the term of six months, fixed for the exchange of the rati-
fications in the 16th article, may afford no obstacle in any manner,
it is my deliberate will that the present ratification be as valid and
firm, and produce the same effects, as if it had been done within the determined period. Desirous at the same time of avoiding any doubt or ambiguity concerning the mean-
ing of the Sth article of the said treaty, in respect to the date which is pointed out in it as the period for the confirmation of the grants
of lands in the Floridas, made by me, or by the competent authorities
in my royal name, which point of date was fixed in the positive understanding of the three grants of land made in favor of the Duke of Alagon, the Count of Punonrostro, and Don Pedro de Vargas, being annulled by its tenor, I think pro-
per to declare that the said three grants have remained and do remain entirely annulled and invalid ;
and that neither the three individuals mentioned, nor those who may have title or interest through them, can avail themselves of the
said grants at any time, or in any manner : under which explicit declaration the said Sth article is to be understood as ratified. In the faith of all which I have commanded to despatch these presents.

THE KING. My Governor and Captain General of the Island of Cuba and its dependencies: The Duke of Alagon, Baron de Espes, has manifested to me, on the twelfth of July last, as follows :--" Sire : The Duke of Alagon, Baron de Espes, Captain of your majesty's Royal Body Guards, with the greatest respect, exposes: that, it being the interest of the crown that the uncultivated lands should be given to great capitalists, in order that they may be peopled and cultivated, from which flow the advantages pointed out and advised by all politicians, and by means of which much or nearly the most of the fertile soil of the Floridas has been discovered, and it being a right of your majesty, as absolute lord, to distribute them for the benefit of agriculture, and in reward and recompense of the eminent services which have been rendered to your majesty and your whole kingdom; being desirous of deserving those marks of the value of his magnanimous courage, and of contributing as far as possible to fulfil the designs of population, so interesting to the commonweal, he humbly requests your majesty, that you would deign to grant him all the uncultivated land not ceded in East Florida which lies between the rivers Saint Lucia and Saint John, as far as the mouths by which they empty themselves into the sea, and the coast of the Gulf of Florida, and the adjacent islands, with the mouth of the river Hijuelos, in the twentysixth degree of latitude, following the left bank up to its source, drawing a line from Lake Macaco, then descending by the way of the river Saint John to the Lake Valdes, crossing by another line from the, extreme north of said lake to the source of the river Amarima, following its right bank as far as its mouth, in the twenty-eighth or twentyfifth degree of latitude, and running along the sea-coast, with all the adjacent Islands up to the mouth of the river Hijuelos, in full property to himself and his heirs: allowing them also to import negroes, for the labor and cultivation of the lands, free of duties: A gift which I hope to obtain from your Majesty's innate goodness." Having taken the premises into consideration, and bearing in mind the distinguished merit of the memorialist, and his signal zeal for my royal service, as well as the benefits to be derived by the state from an increase of population in the countries the cession whereof he has solicited, I have judged fit to grant him the same, in so far as is conformable to the laws of these my kingdoms; and to make it known to my

measures for its accomplishment, without injury to any third party: and in order that the said Duke of Alagon may forthwith carry his plans into execution, in con-

THE KING. My Governor and Captain General of the Island of Cuba and its dependencies : The Brigadier Count of Punonrostro submitted to me, on the third of November last, what follows: "Sire: The Brigadier Count of Punonrostro, Grandee of Spain of the first class, and your Gentleman of the Bed Chamber in actual attendance, &c., &c., throws himself at your Majesty's Royal feet with the most profound respect, and submits to your Majesty: That, prompted by the desire of promoting, by all possible means, the improvement of the extensive waste and unsettled lands possessed by your Majesty in

the Americas, which, by their fertility, offer the greatest advantages, not only to your memorialist, but to the state, provided due effect, as is hoped, be given to the noble project formed by your Majesty's memorialist, of converting a small portion of those deserts into the abode of peaceable Christians and industrious inhabitants, who will increase the population of your kingdoms, promote agriculture and commerce, and thereby add immensely to your royal revenues. This enterprise should be conducted by a person who, with a knowledge of the country, would combine the intelligence necessary for comparing the progress made by other nations in similar situations, and particularly by the United States, which, within a very recent period, have advanced their power to an extraordinary height, and especially in the instance of the Mobile country, adjoining Florida, which, in the last six years, has received such an influx of emigrants, as to be converted from a desert waste into a rich commercial province, highly improved and peopled with more than three hundred thousand souls. A similar change would be effected in Florida within eighteen or twenty years, by the adoption of judicious arrangements, and by those exertions which your Majesty's memorialist proposes to employ for the promotion of his personal interest, and consequently that of the state. Relying on the merits of the case, and the lively interest felt by your Majesty in the national prosperity, and in the services and sacrifices of your Majesty's memorialist, he humbly requests your Majesty that, taking them into consideration, you would be graciously pleased to grant and cede to him, in full right and property, and the mode and manner required by law, all the waste lands, not heretofore ceded in Florida, lying between the river Perdido, westward of the Gulf of Mexico, and the rivers Amaruja and Saint Johns, from Popa to the point where it empties into the ocean, for the eastern limit; and, for the northern, the boundary line of the United States; and, to the south, by the Gulf of Mexico, including the desert islands on the coast. He therefore humbly prays, in consideration of the premises, and the unquestionable advantages to be derived by the nation, your Majesty will be pleased to grant this his petition ; and, thereupon, direct the necessary orders to be given to the local authorities to afford him all due aid and protection, as well in designating the territory
referred to, as in giving full effect to the whole enterprise. All which he hopes from the munificence of your Majesty."
Having taken the premises into consideration, and bearing in mind the distinguished merits of the memorialist, and his signal zeal for my royal service, as well as the benefits to be derived by the state from an increase of population in the countries, the cession whereof he has solicited, I have judged fit to grant him the same, in so far as is conformable to the laws of these my kingdoms, and to make it known to my Council of the Indies, for its due execution, by a royal order of the seventeenth of December, in the year aforementioned ; wherefore, I charge and command you, by this, my Royal Cedula, with due observance of the laws to such cases pertaining, to give full and due effect to the said cession, taking all requisite measures for its accomplishment, without injury to any third party, and, to the end, that the said Count of Punonrostro may forthwith carry his plans into execution, in conformity with my beneficent desires in favor of the agriculture and commerce of the said territories, which require a population proportionate to the fertility of the soil, and the defence and security of the coasts, he giving regular accounts of his proceedings, for such is my will; and that due note be taken of the present Cedula in the office of the Accountant General of the Indies.

THE KING.

My Governor and Captain General of the Island of Cuba and its dependencies:
Under date of the twenty-fifth of January last, Don Pedro de Vargas manifested to me as follows: " Sire: Don Pedro de Vargas, Knight of the Royal Order of Alcantara, Treasurer General of the Royal House and patrimony of your Majesty, with the most
profound respect, at your royal feet, exposes--That there is a quantity of vacant and unpeopled land in the territory of the Floridas, and desiring that, if your Majesty shall deign to reward his passable services, and the proofs which he has given of his loyalty, it may be without the least burthen on the public treasury, or in prejudice of any third person, as may be done at present by some lands of that country, he beseeches your
Majesty that, by an effect of your sovereign goodness, you would deign to grant him
the property of the land which lies comprised within the following limits: that is to say ; from the mouth of the river Perdido, and its bay in the Gulf of Mexico, following the sea coast, to ascend by the bay of Buen Socorro, and of Mobile, continuing by the river Mobile, till it touches the northern line of the United States, and descending by that in a right line to the source of the river Perdido, and following the river Mobile in its lower part, and the bay of that name, returns by the sea coast towards the west;
comprehending all the creeks, entries, and islands, adjacent, which may belong to Spain at the present time, till it reaches the west line of the United States, then, returning by their northern line, comprehending all the waste lands which belong, or
may belong, to Spain, and are in dispute or reclamation with the United States, ac-
cording to the tenor of the treaties, and, also, all the waste land not ceded to any other individual, which is between the river Hijuelos, in East Florida, and the river St. Lucia,
drawing a line from the source of one river to the source of the other, and following by the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, from the mouth of the Hijuelos to the point of Tancha, and doubling this, by the coast of the Gulf of Florida, to the mouth of the river Saint Lucia, with the islands and keys adjacent."
Considering the contents of this exposition, and attending to the merit of the individual, and his accredited zeal for my royal service; as also to the advantages to
result to the state from peopling the said countries, I have thought proper to accede to the favor which he solicits, in as far as it be not opposed to the laws of these my kingdoms, and communicated it to my Council of the Indies, for its accomplishment, in a royal order of the second of February last. Consequently, I command and charge
you, by this my royal cedula, that, conforming to the laws which regulate in these affairs, and without prejudice to third persons, that you efficaciously aid the execution
of the said grant, taking all the measures which may conduce tq its due effect, as
also to the augmentation of the population, agriculture, and commerce of the aforesaid possessions, giving account, from time to time, of the progress made, for this is my will; and that due notice shall be taken of this cedula, in the office of the Accountant
General of the Indies. Dated at the Palace, the ninth of April, one thousand eight hundred and eighteen.
