Columbia, and other questions arising in the district, have been : The act of Congress of 27 February, 1801, concerning the District of Columbia, directs that writs of
error shall be prosecuted in the same manner, under the same regulations, and the same proceedings shall be had thereon, as is or shall be provided in case of writs of error on judgments, or appeals upon orders or decrees, rendered in the circuit courts of the United States. United States v. Hooe et al., 1 Cranch, 318 ; 1 Cond. Rep. 322.
By the separation of the District of Columbia from the state of Maryland, the residents in that part of Maryland which became a part of the district ceased to be citizens of the state. Reilly, Appellant v. Lamar et al., 2 Cranch, 344; 1 Cond. Rep. 419.
A citizen of the District of Columbia, could not be discharged by the insolvent law of Maryland, out of the district. Ibid.
A citizen of the District of Columbia, cannot maintain an action in the circuit court of the United States, out of the district; he not being a citizen of a state within the meaning of the provision in the law of the United States, regulating the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States. Hepburn and Dundas v. Ellzey, 2 Cranch, 445 ; 1 Cond'. Rep. 444.
A justice of the peace, in the District of Columbia, is an officer of the government of the United States ; and is exempt from militia duty. Wise v. Withers, 3 Cranch, 331; 1 Cond. Rep. 552.
Under the sixth and eighth sections of the act of assembly of Virginia, of the 22d of December, 1794, property pledged to the Mutual Assurance Society, &c. continues liable for assessments, on account of the losses insured against, in the hands of a bona fide purchaser, without notice. The Mutual Assurance Society v. Watts' Ex'rs, 1 Wheat. 279; 3 Cond. Rep. 570.
A mere change of sovereignty produces no change in the state of rights existing in the soil; and the cession of the District of Columbia to the national government did not affect the lien created by the above act on real property situate in the town of Alexandria; though the personal character or liability of a member of the society could not be thereby forced on a purchaser of such property. Ibid.
Congress has authority to impose a direct tax on the District of Columbia, in proportion to the census directed to be taken by the constitution. Loughborough v. Blake, 5 Wheat. 317; 4 Cond. Rep. 660.
Congress, when legislating for the District of Columbia, under the fifth section of the first article of the constitution, is still the legislature of the Union, and its acts are the laws of the United States. Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264; 5 Cond. Rep. 90.
An act of the legislature of Maryland, passed the 19th of December, 1791, entitled " An act concerning the territory of Columbia, and the city of Washington," which, by the 6thsection, provides for the holding of lands by " foreigners," is an enabling act; and applies to those only who could not take lands without the provisions of that law. It enables a " foreigner" to take in the same manner as if he were a citizen. Spratt v. Spratt, 1 Peters, 349.
A foreigner who becomes a citizen, is no longer a foreigner, within the view of the act. Thus, after purchase, lands vested in him as a citizen ; not by virtue of the act of the legislature of Maryland, but because of his acquiring the rights of citizenship. Ibid.
Land in the county of Washington, and District of Columbia, purchased by a foreigner, before naturalization, was held by him under the law of Maryland, and might be transmitted to the relations of the purchasers, who were foreigners: and the capacity so to transmit those lands, is given, absolutely, by this act, and is not affected by his becoming a citizen ; but passes to his heirs and relations, precisely as if he had remained a foreigner. Ibid.
The supreme court of the United States has jurisdiction of appeals from the orphans' court, through the circuit court for the county of Washington, by virtue of the act of Congress of February 13, 1801; and by the act of Congress subsequently passed, the matter in dispute, exclusive of costs, must exceed the value of one thousand dollars, in order to entitle the party to an appeal. Nicholls et al. v. Hodges' Ex'rs, 1 Peters, 565.
The statute of Elizabeth is in force in the District of Columbia. Cathcart et al. v. Robinson, 5 Peters 264.
The levy court of Washington county is not entitled to one half of all the fines, penalties, and forfeitures imposed by the circuit court in cases at common law, and under the acts of Congress, as well as the acts of assembly of Maryland, adopted by Congress as the law of the District of Columbia. Levy Court of Washington v. Ringgold, 5 Peters, 451.
The supreme court of the United States has no jurisdiction of causes brought before it, upon a certificate of division of opinion of the judges of the circuit court for the District of Columbia. The appellate jurisdiction, in respect to that court, extends only to its final judgments and decrees. Ross v. Triplett. 3 Wheat. 600; 4 Cond. Rep. 351.
By the insolvent law of Maryland, of January 3, 1800, the chancellor of Maryland could not discharge one who was an inhabitant of the District of Columbia, after the separation from Maryland, unless previous

as they now exist, shall be and continue in force in that part of the said district, which was ceded by that state to the United States, and by them
accepted as aforesaid. Sec . 2. And be itfurther enacted, That the said district of Columbia
shall be formed into two counties; one county shall contain all that part of said district, which lies on the east side of the river Potomac, together with the islands therein, and shall be called the county of Washington ; the other county shall contain all that part of said district, which lies on the west side of said river, and shall be called the county of Alexandria ; and the said river in its whole course through said district shall be taken and deemed to all intents and purposes to be within both of said counties.
Sec . 3. Be it further enacted, That there shall be a court in said district, which shall be called the circuit court of the district of Columbia; and the said court and the judges thereof shall have all the
powers by law vested in the circuit courts and the judges of the circuit courts of the United States. Said court shall consist of one chief judge and two assistant judges resident within said district, to hold their respective offices during good behaviour: any two of whom shall constitute a quorum; and each of the said judges shall, before he enter on his office, take the oath or affirmation provided by law to be taken by the

to that separation he had entitled himself to a discharge by performing all the requisites of the act. Reilly v. Lamar et al. 2 Cranch, 344; 1 Cond. Rep. 419.
No appeal or writ of error lies, in a criminal case, from the judgment of the circuit court of the District of Columbia, to the supreme court of the United States: the appellate jurisdiction given by the act of Congress, is confined to civil cases. United States v. Moore, 3 Cranch, 159; 1 Cond. Rep. 480.
There is, in the District of Columbia, no division of powers between the general and the state governments. Congress has the entire control over the district, for every purpose of government: and it is reasonable to suppose that, in organizing a judicial department in the district, all the judicial power, necessary for the purpose of government, would be vested in the courts of justice. Kendall, Postmaster General v. The United States, 12 Peters, 524.
The circuit court of the United States, for the District of Columbia, has a right to award a mandamus to the postmaster-general of the United States, requiring him to pass to the credit of certain contractors for conveying the mail of the United States, a sum found to be due to them by the solicitor of the treasury of the United States, the solicitor acting under the special provisions of an act of Congress. Ibid.
There can be no doubt, that, in the state of Maryland, a writ of mandamus might be issued to an executive officer, commanding him to perform a ministerial act, required of him by the laws: and if it would lie in that state, there can be no good reason why it should not lie in the District of Columbia, in analogous cases. Ibid.
The powers of the supreme court of the United States, and of the circuit courts of the United States, to issue writs of mandamus, granted by the fourteenth section of the judiciary act of 1789, is only for the purpose of bringing the case to a final judgment or decree, so that it may be reviewed. The mandamus does not direct the inferior court how to proceed, but only that it must proceed, according to its own judgment, to a final determination ; otherwise it cannot be reviewed in the appellate court. It is different in the circuit court of the District of Columbia, under the adoption of the laws of Maryland, which included the common law. Ibid.
The power of the circuit court of the District of Columbia, to exercise the jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus to a public officer, to do an act required of him by law, results from the third section of the act of Congress of February 27, 1804 ; which declares that the court and judges thereof shall have all the powers by law vested in the circuit courts of the United States. The circuit courts referred to, were those established by the act of February 13, 1801. The repeal of that law, fifteen months afterwards, and after that law had gone into operation, under the act of February 27, 1801, could notin any manner affect that law, any further than was provided by the repealing act. Ibid.
The circuit courts of the United States, sitting in the states of the Union, have no jurisdiction in a case in which a citizen of the District of Columbia is plaintiff. Westcott's Lessee v. Inhabitants, &c. Peters' C. C. R. 45.
The act of Congress of June, 1822, authorizes any person to whom administration has been granted by the states of the United States, to prosecute claims by suits in the District of Columbia, in the same manner as if the same had been granted by proper authority, in the District of Columbia, to such persons. The power is limited by its terms to the institution of suits, and does not authorize suits against an executor or administrator. The effect of this law was to make all debts due by persons in the District of Columbia, not local assets, for which the administrator was bound to account in the courts of the district, but general assets which he had full authority to receive, and for which he was bound to account in the courts of the state from which he derived his letters of administration. Vaughan et al. v. Northup et al 15 Peters' Rep. 1.
The courts of the United States in the District of Columbia, have a like jurisdiction upon personal property, with the courts in England, and in the states of the Union; and in the absence of statutory provisions, in the trial of them they must apply the same common law principle which regulates the mode of bringing such actions, the pleadings and the proof.

But when a party in a cause shall deem himselfaggrieved by any final judgment or decree of the said circuit court, where the matter in dispute shall be of the value of $100, and of less value than $1000, on a petition to a justice of the supreme court, if the said justice shall be of opinion that errors in the proceedings of the court involve questions of law of such extensive interest and operation as to render the final judgment of the supreme court desirable, the case may be removed at the discretion of the said justice.

States of America, and to the request made to them in his name to per-

mit the opening of the road. And as the persons,-towns, villages, lands,
