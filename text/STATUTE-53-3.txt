III. COMPÉTENCE
ARTICLE 25.
Aux fins de la compétence des tribunaux mixtes , le mot "étrangers " comprend les ressortissants des Hautes Parties contractantes à la Convention de Montreux concernant l'abolition des Capitulations en Egypte, ainsi que les ressortissants de tout autre Etat qui pourrait être visé par décret .
Aucun ressortissant égyptien ne pourra se prévaloir de la protection d'une Puissance étrangère.
Les ressortissants de la Syrie et du Liban ainsi que ceux de la Palestine et de la Transjordanie seront justiciables de la juridiction nationale tant en matière civile qu'en matière pénale.
Les ressortissants étrangers (citoyens, sujets et protégés ) appartenant à des religions , confessions ou rites pour lesquels il existe des tribunaux égyptiens de statut personnel, continueront , dans les mêmes conditions que dans le passé, à être jugés , en cette matière, par lesdits tribunaux .
Les ressortissants susvisés auront en outre la faculté d'opter en matière civile et commerciale entre la juridiction mixte et la juridiction nationale. Lorsqu'un desdits ressortissants sera cité, dans l'une de ces matières, devant un tribunal national, dans une affaire à propos de laquelle il n'aura pas préalablement accepté la compétence de la juridiction nationale, il devra, s'il désire décliner la compétence du tribunal saisi , le faire par lettre recommandée ou exploit d'huissier, ou au plus tard à la première audience, faute de quoi le tribunal sera compétent .
A. Compétence en Matière Civile et Commerciale.
ARTICLE 26 .
Les tribunaux mixtes connaissent de toutes contestations en matière civile et commerciale entre étrangers et entre étrangers et justiciables des tribunaux nationaux.
Toutefois, les tribunaux nationaux sont compétents en ces matières à l'égard de tout étranger qui accepte de se soumettre à leur juridiction .
Cette soumission peut résulter d'une clause attributive de compétence ou du fait: 1° que l'étranger a lui-même introduit la procédure devant les tribunaux nationaux ; 2° qu'il n'a pas décliné la compétence de ces tribunaux avant le prononcé d'un jugement dans une procédure où il a comparu comme défendeur ou intervenant .
Le fait de se soumettre à la juridiction d'un tribunal de premier degré entraîne la soumission à la juridiction des tribunaux supérieurs du même ordre.
ARTICLE 27.
Les tribunaux mixtes connaissent également des contestations et des questions relatives au statut personnel dans les cas où la loi applicable aux termes de l'article 29 est une loi étrangère.

ARTICLE 32.
Les règles de procédure prévues par une loi étrangère ne sont pas applicables en tant qu'elles sont incompatibles avec les règles de procédure égyptiennes.
ARTICLE 33.
Sous réserve des dispositions des articles 34 , 35, 36 et 37 , la compétence des tribunaux mixtes est déterminée uniquement par la nationalité des parties réellement en cause, sans égard aux intérêts mixtes qui pourraient être indirectement engagés.
ARTICLE 34.
Dans leurs contestations avec des justiciables des tribunaux nationaux, les sociétés de nationalité égyptienne déjà constituées, dans lesquelles entrent des intérêts étrangers sérieux, sont justiciables des tribunaux mixtes, à moins que leurs statuts ne contiennent une clause attributive de compétence aux tribunaux nationaux ou qu'elles n'aient accepté la juridiction de ces tribunaux conformément à l'article 26.

ARTICLE 37.
Les tribunaux mixtes ne peuvent pas connaître d'une action qui n'est pas en soi de leur compétence, même si elle se présente comme accessoire à une action déjà introduite devant eux.

Les tribunaux mixtes peuvent, s'ils estiment devoir le faire dans l'intérêt de la justice , renvoyer les parties se pourvoir devant les tribunaux nationaux lorsque l'action introduite devant eux se présente comme une action accessoire à une action principale déjà introduite devant lesdits tribunaux nationaux .

ARTICLE 38 .
Ne sont pas soumises aux tribunaux mixtes les demandes des étrangers contre un wakf en revendication de la propriété d'immeubles de ce wakf ; mais ces tribunaux sont compétents pour statuer sur la demande intentée sur la question de possession légale, quel que soit le demandeur ou le défendeur.
Ne sont pas non plus de la compétence des tribunaux mixtes les contestations ayant directement ou indirectement pour objet la constitution d'un wakf, la validité, l'interprétation ou l'application de ses clauses, ou la nomination ou révocation du nazir.
Les tribunaux mixtes peuvent toutefois déclarer inopposable aux créanciers du constituant la constitution en wakf d'un bien, faite en fraude de leurs droits.
ARTICLE 39.
Lorsque, dans une instance, une exception relative au statut personnel d'une partie justiciable en cette matière d'une autre juridiction est soulevée, les tribunaux mixtes, s'ils reconnaissent la nécessité de faire statuer au préalable sur l'exception , doivent surseoir au jugement du fond et fixer un délai à la partie contre laquelle la question préjudicielle a été soulevée pour la faire juger définitivement par le juge compétent. Si cette nécessité n'est pas reconnue, il sera passé outre au jugement du fond.
ARTICLE 40.
La cession d'un droit à un étranger, la mise en cause d'un étranger ou la constitution d'un prête-nom étranger ne peut donner compétence aux tribunaux mixtes pour statuer sur des contestations de la compétence des tribunaux nationaux, lorsque la cession , la mise en cause ou la constitution du prête-nom a pour but de distraire des tribunaux nationaux la connaissance de ces litiges.
Est présumée avoir été faite dans ce but toute cession consentie en cours d'instance. Le tribunal peut toutefois, dans de cas exceptionnels , admettre la preuve du contraire.
Sous réserve de la disposition de l'alinéa précédent, l'exception de prête-nom ne saurait être opposée lorsqu'il s'agit de cessions par voie d'endossement d'effets de commerce.
L'endossement irrégulier ou en recouvrement d'un effet de commerce à un étranger ne donne pas compétence aux tribunaux mixtes pour des contestations de la compétence des tribunaux nationaux.
ARTICLE 41 .
Lorsque le plaideur , dont le caractère étranger donnait compétence aux tribunaux mixtes, ne se trouve plus, avant la clôture des débats, être partie à l'instance, ces tribunaux, sur l'exception soulevée par l'une des parties , cesseront d'avoir compétence dans l'affaire qui sera transférée en l'état aux tribunaux nationaux .

Ils ne peuvent pas, non plus, statuer sur la propriété du domaine public .
Mais, sans pouvoir interpréter un acte d'administration ou en arrêter l'exécution, ils sont compétents pour connaître: 1º en matière civile ou commerciale, de toutes contestations mobilières ou immobilières entre les étrangers et l'Etat ; 2º de toute action en responsabilité civile intentée par un étranger contre l'Etat à raison de mesures administratives prises en violation des lois ou règlements.

Nevertheless , the National Tribunals shall be competent in the aforesaid matters in respect of any foreigner who agrees to submit himself to their jurisdiction .

Submission to the jurisdiction of a court of first instance entails submission to the jurisdiction of superior courts of the same category.
ARTICLE 27
The Mixed Tribunals shall also take cognizance of suits and matters relating to personal status in cases wherein the law to be applied according to the terms of Article 29 is a foreign law.

ARTICLE 33

ARTICLE 34

Companies of Egyptian nationality already incorporated, in which there are substantial foreign interests shall , in their suits with persons subject to the jurisdiction of the National Tribunals, be subject to the jurisdiction of the Mixed Tribunals unless the terms of their incorporation contain a clause attributing competence to the National Tribunals , or unless they have accepted the jurisdiction of the said courts in accordance with Article 26 .

ARTICLE 35

The Mixed Tribunals shall similarly be competent in matters

arising out of the bankruptcy of a person subject to the jurisdiction of the National Tribunals if one of the creditors party to the pro-

ceedings is a foreigner.

ARTICLE 36

The creation of a charge in favor of a foreigner over immovable property, whoever may be the person in possession or the owner thereof, renders the Mixed Tribunals ipso facto competent to determine the validity of the charge and all its consequences up to and including the forced sale of the said property and also the distribution of the monies realised thereby.
ARTICLE 37

The Mixed Tribunals shall not take cognizance of an action not in itself falling within their competence, even if it arises as subsidiary to an action already constituted before them.

53 STAT. ] MULTILATERAL- CAPITULATIONS IN EGYPT-MAY 8, 1937

The Mixed Tribunals may, nevertheless , declare void as against creditors the constitution of property as a Wakf in fraud of the rights of such creditors.
ARTICLE 39
When, in the course of proceedings , an issue is raised concerning the personal status of a party coming in that respect within the jurisdiction of some other court, the Mixed Tribunals shall , if they consider it necessary to secure a preliminary decision upon that issue, suspend judgment on the main issue and prescribe a time limit within which the party against whom the interlocutory plea has been raised must have the matter finally decided by the competent court . If such a preliminary decision is not considered necessary, they shall proceed to give a decision on the main issue.
ARTICLE 40
The cession of a right to a foreigner, the citing of a foreigner as third party, or a fictitious assignment to a foreigner shall not render the Mixed Tribunals competent to decide suits coming within the competence of the National Courts if the object of the said cession, citation as third party or fictitious assignment is to remove such litigation from the cognizance of the National Tribunals.
Any cession of a right to a foreigner agreed to during the course of the proceedings shall be presumed to have been made with the above object. The Court may, however, in exceptional cases, admit proof to the contrary.
Subject to the provisions of the preceding paragraph, the competence of the Mixed Tribunals cannot be challenged on the ground that the assignment is fictitious where the assignment is made by means of the endorsement of a negotiable instrument.
The irregular endorsement of a negotiable instrument to a foreigner, or its endorsement to a foreigner for purposes of collection, shall not give competence to the Mixed Tribunals in the case of suits that are within the competence of the National Courts.

Déclaration du Gouvernement Royal Égyptien
LES SOUSSIGNÉS , agissant en vertu de leurs pleins pouvoirs , procèdent à la déclaration suivante:
1. COMPÉTENCE DES TRIBUNAUX MIXTES.
Le Gouvernement royal égyptien , se référant à l'article 25 alinéa premier du Règlement d'organisation judiciaire, a déjà décidé d'étendre par décret la compétence des tribunaux mixtes aux ressortissants des huit Etats suivants : Allemagne, Autriche, Hongrie, Pologne, Roumanie, Suisse, Tchécoslovaquie et Yougoslavie.
2. RÈGLE DE NON DISCRIMINATION .
En ce qui concerne l'article 2 alinéa 2 de la Convention et le Protocole relatif à ce texte, le fait d'avoir limité à la durée de la période transitoire l'effet de la règle de non discrimination visée dans l'article 2 précité n'implique pas , de la part du Gouvernement royal égyptien, l'intention de suivre en cette matière , à la fin de ladite période , une politique opposée , de discrimination au détriment des étrangers. Le Gouvernement royal égyptien est d'ailleurs disposé à conclure des traités d'établissement et d'amitié avec les diverses Puissances.
3. STATUT PERSONNEL.
Ayant déjà spontanément adopté le principe de la personnalité des lois en matière de statut personnel, notamment dans les traités d'établissement conclus avec l'Iran et la Turquie, le Gouvernement royal égyptien entend suivre en cette matière à l'avenir le même principe.
Quant aux règles de procédure que le Gouvernement royal égyptien se propose d'édicter en matière de statut personnel , elles seront appliquées sous réserve qu'une règle de fond de la loi nationale étrangère ne fasse pas obstacle à cette application .
4. EXPULSION
L'abolition des Capitulations entraînant la suppression de toutes les restrictions au droit du Gouvernement royal égyptien d'expulser les étrangers se trouvant sur le territoire de l'Egypte, il n'entre pas cependant dans les intentions de ce Gouvernement d'exercer, durant la période transitoire, son droit d'expulsion à l'égard d'un étranger justiciable des tribunaux mixtes qui aura résidé en Egypte pendant au moins cinq années, ni de lui refuser l'accès du territoire égyptien s'il l'a temporairement quitté, sauf dans l'un des cas suivants :
a) s'il a été condamné pour un crime ou pour un délit punissable de plus de trois mois d'emprisonnement ;

53 STAT. ] MULTILATERAL- CAPITULATIONS IN EGYPT- MAY 8, 1937

1701

Declaration by the Royal Egyptian Government
THE UNDERSIGNED, acting in virtue of their full powers, make the following declaration :
1. COMPETENCE OF THE MIXED TRIBUNALS .
With reference to Article 25 , paragraph 1 , of the Règlement d'organisation judiciaire, the Royal Egyptian Government has already decided to extend by decree the competence of the Mixed Tribunals to nationals of the following eight States: Austria, Czechoslovakia, Germany, Hungary, Poland , Roumania, Switzerland , Yugoslavia.
2. NON-DISCRIMINATION RULE.
With reference to Article 2, paragraph 2, of the Convention and the Protocol relating thereto, the fact that the effect of the non-discrimination rule referred to in the above-mentioned Article 2 is limited to the duration of the transition period , does not imply any intention on the part of the Royal Egyptian Government to pursue thereafter in this matter any contrary policy of discrimination against foreigners. The Royal Egyptian Government is, moreover, prepared to conclude Establishment Treaties and Treaties of Friendship with the various Powers .
3. PERSONAL STATUS .
The Royal Egyptian Government, having already, and more particularly in the Establishment Treaties which it has concluded with Iran and Turkey, spontaneously adopted the principle that, in matters of personal status , the personal law should apply, intends to adopt the same principle with regard thereto in the future.
As regards the rules of procedure, which the Royal Egyptian Government intends to enact for cases of personal status , these will be applied provided that no substantive rule of the foreign national law prevents their application.
4. DEPORTATION.
Although the abolition of Capitulations entails the removal of all the existing restrictions on the Royal Egyptian Government's right to deport foreigners who are within Egyptian territory, nevertheless that Government does not intend to exercise during the transition period its right of deportation in respect of a foreigner subject to the jurisdiction of the Mixed Tribunals, who shall have resided in Egypt for at least five years , or to refuse such a foreigner access to Egyptian territory, if he has temporarily quitted that territory, unless :
(a) he has been convicted in respect of a crime or misdemeanour punishable by more than three months ' imprisonment, or

1702

TREATIES

[53 STAT.

b) s'il s'est rendu coupable d'activités de nature subversive ou portant atteinte à l'ordre public ou à la tranquillité, la morale ou la santé publiques ;
c) s'il est indigent et à la charge de l'Etat .
Le Gouvernement royal égyptien se propose en outre d'instituer une commission administrative consultative dont fera partie le Procureur général près les tribunaux mixtes, en vue de faire examiner par elle, le cas échéant, les contestations au sujet soit de l'identité ou de la nationalité de la personne dont l'expulsion est envisagée , soit de la durée de son séjour en Egypte, soit de l'existence des faits sur lesquels l'expulsion est basée.

5. EXTRADITION.

Conformément à la pratique généralement adoptée en matière d'extradition, le Gouvernement royal égyptien a l'intention d'adopter en cette matière la procédure judiciaire. Les tribunaux mixtes auront donc à se prononcer sur la vérification de la régularité de la demande d'extradition, lorsqu'elle concernera un étranger justiciable de ces tribunaux .

6. CLAUSE ATTRIBUTIVE DE COMPÉTENCE.

Se référant à l'article 26 du Règlement d'organisation judiciaire, le Gouvernement royal égyptien n'a pas l'intention d'insérer dans les contrats du gouvernement (y compris les contrats des administrations publiques et des municipalités ) de clause attributive de compétence juridictionnelle .
7. MAGISTRATS, FONCTIONNAIRES ET BARREAU.
Il n'entre pas dans les intentions du Gouvernement royal égyptien de modifier les conditions de service ou les traitements actuels des magistrats des tribunaux mixtes.
De même, le Gouvernement n'a pas l'intention de modifier les traitements actuels des fonctionnaires et employés desdits tribunaux. Il examinera avec bienveillance à l'occasion de l'établissement du nouveau cadre actuellement à l'étude la situation desdits fonctionnaires et employés au point de vue des classes et conditions d'augmentation ou de promotion.

53 STAT. ] MULTILATERAL- CAPITULATIONS IN EGYPT-MAY 8, 1937
(b) he has been guilty of activities of a subversive nature or to the prejudice of public order or public tranquillity , morality or health, or
(c) he is indigent and a burden upon the State. The Royal Egyptian Government further proposes to set up an administrative advisory committee , of which the Procurator General of the Mixed Tribunals shall be a member, for the purpose of examining any disputes on the subject of the identity or the nationality of the person whose deportation is under consideration, or of the length of his residence in Egypt, or of the existence of the facts which constitute the grounds for deportation.
5. EXTRADITION .
In conformity with the practice generally adopted in regard to extradition, the Royal Egyptian Government intends to adopt judicial procedure in this matter. It will therefore be necessary for the Mixed Tribunals to pronounce upon the regularity of the request for extradition when such request relates to a foreigner within the jurisdiction of the said Tribunals.
6. CLAUSE RELATING TO THE JURISDICTION TO WHICH DISPUTES SHOULD BE SUBMITTED.
With reference to Article 26 of the Règlement d'organisation judiciaire, the Royal Egyptian Government does not intend to insert in Government contracts (including contracts made by public administrations and municipalities ) any clause relating to the jurisdiction to which disputes should be submitted.
7. JUDGES, OFFICIALS AND MEMBERS OF THe Bar.
The Royal Egyptian Government does not intend to alter either the existing conditions of service or the present salaries of judges of the Mixed Tribunals.
Similarly, the Government does not intend to alter the present salaries of officials and employees of the said Tribunals .
It will give sympathetic consideration to their treatment in respect of grading, rules for increase of salary and promotion, when the new cadre now being considered is introduced.

Letters Relating to Educational, Medical, and Charitable Institutions (Associations or Foundations)

a) Letter from the President of the Egyptian Delegation to the President of the Delegation of the United States of America.

SIR,

MONTREUX, May 8th 1937.

As Your Excellency has expressed a desire to receive detailed information concerning the situation of the educational , medical and charitable institutions (associations or foundations) of the United

States of America in Egypt, I have the honour to state that the Royal

Egyptian Government is prepared to assure you that pending the conclusion of a subsequent agreement or, in any case until the end of the transition period , all the above-mentioned institutions , actually existing in the country at the date of the Convention signed this day, may continue freely to carry on their activities in Egypt, whether educational, scientific, medical or charitable, subject to the following conditions :

(1 ) They shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Mixed Tribunals and shall be subject to Egyptian laws and regulations, including fiscal laws, under the same conditions as similar Egyptian institutions, and also to all measures necessary for the preservation of public order in Egypt.

ment is provided in this Treaty, the nationals of each of the High Contracting Parties shall not be treated by the other less favorably than the nationals of any other country.

5. It is understood that the most-favored-nation treatment in respect of the control of the means of international payment provided for in the last paragraph of Article 3 of this Treaty shall be applied unconditionally, and that such control shall be administered so as not to influence to the disadvantage of the other High Contracting Party the competitive relationships between articles originating in the territories of such Party and similar articles originating in third countries and so as not to impair the operation of any other provisions of this Treaty.

Lesquels, après avoir communiqué leurs pleins pouvoirs respectifs , trouvés en bonne et due forme, sont convenus des dispositions suivantes :-
ARTICLE 1er.

1. Les pays auxquels s'applique la présente Convention sont constitués à l'état d'Union pour la protection de la propriété industrielle .
2. La protection de la propriété industrielle a pour objet les brevets d'invention, les modèles d'utilité, les dessins ou modèles industriels, les marques de fabrique ou de commerce, le nom commercial et les indications de provenance ou appellations d'origine, ainsi que la répression de la concurrence déloyale .
3. La propriété industrielle s'entend dans l'acception la plus large et s'applique non seulement à l'industrie et au commerce proprement dits, mais également au domaine des industries agricoles et extractives et à tous produits fabriqués ou naturels, par exemple: vins , grains, feuilles de tabac, fruits, bestiaux, minéraux, eaux minérales, bières, fleurs, farines.
4. Parmi les brevets d'invention sont comprises les diverses espèces de brevets industriels admises par les législations des pays de l'Union, telles que brevets d'importation, brevets de perfectionnement, brevets et certificats d'addition , etc.

ARTICLE 2 .

1. Les ressortissants de chacun des pays de l'Union jouiront dans tous les autres pays de l'Union, en ce qui concerne la protection de la propriété industrielle , des avantages que les lois respectives accordent actuellement ou accorderont par la suite aux nationaux, le tout sans préjudice des droits spécialement prévus par la présente Convention . En conséquence, ils auront la même protection que ceux-ci et le même recours légal contre toute atteinte portée à leurs droits, sous réserve de l'accomplissement des conditions et formalités imposées aux nationaux.
2. Toutefois, aucune condition de domicile ou d'établissement dans le pays où la protection est réclamée ne peut être exigée des ressor-

53 STAT. ] MULTILATERAL- INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY-JUNE 2, 1934
tissants de l'Union pour la jouissance d'aucun des droits de propriété industrielle .
3. Sont expressément réservées les dispositions de la législation de chacun des pays de l'Union relatives à la procédure judiciaire et administrative et à la compétence, ainsi qu'à l'élection de domicile ou à la constitution d'un mandataire, qui seraient requises par les lois sur la propriété industrielle.
ARTICLE 3.
Sont assimilés aux ressortissants des pays de l'Union les ressortissants des pays ne faisant pas partie de l'Union qui sont domiciliés ou ont des établissements industriels ou commerciaux effectifs et sérieux sur le territoire de l'un des pays de l'Union .
ARTICLE 4.
A.- 1 . Celui qui aura régulièrement fait le dépôt d'une demande de brevet d'invention , d'un modèle d'utilité, d'un dessin ou modèle industriel, d'une marque de fabrique ou de commerce, dans l'un des pays de l'Union, ou son ayant cause, jouira, pour effectuer le dépôt dans les autres pays, d'un droit de priorité pendant les délais déterminés ci-après.
2. Est reconnu comme donnant naissance au droit de priorité tout dépôt ayant la valeur d'un dépôt national régulier en vertu de la loi intérieure de chaque pays de l'Union ou de traités internationaux conclus entre plusieurs pays de l'Union.
B.-En conséquence, le dépôt ultérieurement opéré dans l'un des autres pays de l'Union , avant l'expiration de ces délais, ne pourra être invalidé par des faits accomplis dans l'intervalle, soit, notamment, par un autre dépôt, par la publication de l'invention ou son exploitation, par la mise en vente d'exemplaires du dessin ou du modèle, par l'emploi de la marque, et ces faits ne pourront faire naître aucun droit de tiers ni aucune possession personnelle. Les droits acquis par des tiers avant le jour de la première demande qui sert de base au droit de priorité sont réservés par l'effet de la législation intérieure de chaque pays de l'Union .
C.-1 . Les délais de priorité mentionnés ci-dessus seront de douze mois pour les brevets d'invention et les modèles d'utilité, et de six mois pour les dessins ou modèles industriels et pour les marques de fabrique ou de commerce.
2. Ces délais commencent à courir de la date du dépôt de la première demande ; le jour du dépôt n'est pas compris dans le délai .
3. Si le dernier jour du délai est un jour férié légal ou un jour où le Bureau n'est pas ouvert pour recevoir le dépôt des demandes dans le pays où la protection est réclamée , le délai sera prorogé jusqu'au premier jour ouvrable qui suit .
D.-1 . Quiconque voudra se prévaloir de la priorité d'un dépôt antérieur sera tenu de faire une déclaration indiquant la date et le pays de ce dépôt . Chaque pays déterminera à quel moment, au plus tard , cette déclaration devra être effectuée.

1753

1754

TREATIES

[53 STAT.

2. Ces indications seront mentionnées dans les publications émanant de l'Administration compétente, notamment sur les brevets et les descriptions y relatives.
3. Les pays de l'Union pourront exiger de celui qui fait une déclaration de priorité la production d'une copie de la demande (description, dessins , etc.) déposée antérieurement. La copie, certifiée conforme par l'Administration qui aura reçu cette demande, sera dispensée de toute légalisation , et elle pourra en tous cas être déposée, exempte de frais , à n'importe quel moment dans le délai de trois mois à dater du dépôt de la demande ultérieure . On pourra exiger qu'elle soit accompagnée d'un certificat de la date du dépôt émanant de cette Administration, et d'une traduction .
4. D'autres formalités ne pourront être requises pour la déclaration de priorité au moment du dépôt de la demande. Chaque pays de l'Union déterminera les conséquences de l'omission des formalités prévues par le présent article, sans que ces conséquences puissent excéder la perte du droit de priorité.
5. Ultérieurement d'autres justifications pourront être demandées . E -1 . Lorsqu'un dessin ou modèle industriel aura été déposé dans un pays en vertu d'un droit de priorité basé sur le dépôt d'un modèle d'utilité, le délai de priorité ne sera que celui fixé pour les dessins ou modèles industriels . 2. En outre, il est permis de déposer dans un pays un modèle d'utilité en vertu d'un droit de priorité basé sur le dépôt d'une demande de brevet et inversement . F.-Aucun pays de l'Union ne pourra refuser une demande de brevet pour le motif qu'elle contient la revendication de priorités multiples, à la condition qu'il y ait unité d'invention au sens de la loi du pays. G. Si l'examen révèle qu'une demande de brevet est complexe, le demandeur pourra diviser la demande en un certain nombre de demandes divisionnaires en conservant comme date de chacune la date de la demande initiale et , s'il y a lieu, le bénéfice du droit de priorité. H.-La priorité ne peut être refusée pour le motif que certains éléments de l'invention pour lesquels on revendique la priorité ne figurent pas parmi les revendications formulées dans la demande au pays d'origine, pourvu que l'ensemble des pièces de la demande révèle d'une façon précise lesdits éléments .
ARTICLE 4 bis.
1. Les brevets demandés dans les différents pays de l'Union par des ressortissants de l'Union seront indépendants des brevets obtenus pour la même invention dans les autres pays , adhérents ou non à l'Union .
2. Cette disposition doit s'entendre d'une façon absolue, notamment en ce sens que les brevets demandés pendant le délai de priorité sont indépendants, tant au point de vue des causes de nullité et de déchéance, qu'au point de vue de la durée normale.

53 STAT. ] MULTILATERAL-INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY-JUNE 2, 1934
3. Elle s'applique à tous les brevets existant au moment de sa mise en vigueur.
4. Il en sera de même, en cas d'accession de nouveaux pays , pour les brevets existant de part et d'autre au moment de l'accession.
5. Les brevets obtenus avec le bénéfice de la priorité jouiront, dans les différents pays de l'Union , d'une durée égale à celle dont ils jouiraient s'ils étaient demandés ou délivrés sans le bénéfice de la priorité.
ARTICLE 4 ter.
L'inventeur a le droit d'être mentionné comme tel dans le brevet.
ARTICLE 5.
A.-1 . L'introduction , par le breveté, dans le pays où le brevet a été délivré, d'objets fabriqués dans l'un ou l'autre des pays de l'Union , n'entraînera pas la déchéance.
2. Toutefois, chacun des pays de l'Union aura la faculté de prendre les mesures législatives nécessaires pour prévenir les abus qui pourraient résulter de l'exercice du droit exclusif conféré par le brevet, par exemple faute d'exploitation .
3. Ces mesures ne pourront prévoir la déchéance du brevet que si la concession de licences obligatoires ne suffisait pas pour prévenir ces abus .
4. En tout cas, la concession d'une licence obligatoire ne pourra pas être demandée avant l'expiration de trois années à compter de la date de la délivrance du brevet , et cette licence ne pourra être accordée que si le breveté ne justifie pas d'excuses légitimes. Aucune action en déchéance ou en révocation d'un brevet ne pourra être introduite avant l'expiration de deux années à compter de la concession de la première licence obligatoire.
5. Les dispositions qui précèdent seront applicables , sous réserve des modifications nécessaires, aux modèles d'utilité.
B.-La protection des dessins et modèles industriels ne peut être atteinte par une déchéance quelconque , soit pour défaut d'exploitation , soit pour introduction d'objets conformes à ceux qui sont protégés .
C.- 1 . Si, dans un pays, l'utilisation de la marque enregistrée est obligatoire , l'enregistrement ne pourra être annulé qu'après un délai équitable et si l'intéressé ne justifie pas des causes de son inaction .
2. L'emploi d'une marque de fabrique ou de commerce par le propriétaire, sous une forme qui diffère par des éléments n'altérant pas le caractère distinctif de la marque dans la forme sous laquelle celle-ci a été enregistrée dans l'un des pays de l'Union , n'entraînera pas l'invalidation de l'enregistrement et ne diminuera pas la protection accordée à la marque.
3. L'emploi simultané de la même marque sur des produits identiques ou similaires, par des établissements industriels ou commerciaux considérés comme copropriétaires de la marque d'après les dispositions de la loi nationale du pays où la protection est réclamée, n'empêchera pas l'enregistrement ni ne diminuera d'aucune façon

1755

1756

TREATIES

[53 STAT.

la protection accordée à ladite marque dans n'importe quel pays de l'Union, pourvu que ledit emploi n'ait pas pour effet d'induire le public en erreur et qu'il ne soit pas contraire à l'intérêt public.
D.-Aucun signe ou mention du brevet, du modèle d'utilité, de l'enregistrement de la marque de fabrique ou de commerce ou du dépôt du dessin ou modèle industriel ne sera exigé sur le produit, pour la reconnaissance du droit.
ARTICLE 5 bis.
1. Un délai de grâce, qui devra être au minimum de trois mois, sera accordé pour le payement des taxes prévues pour le maintien des droits de propriété industrielle , moyennant le versement d'une surtaxe, si la législation nationale en impose une.
2. Pour les brevets d'invention, les pays de l'Union s'engagent en outre, soit à porter le délai de grâce à six mois au moins, soit à prévoir la restauration du brevet tombé en déchéance par suite de non-payement de taxes, ces mesures restant soumises aux conditions prévues par la législation intérieure.

ARTICLE 5 ter.
Dans chacun des pays de l'Union ne seront pas considérés comme portant atteinte aux droits du breveté:
1 ° l'emploi , à bord des navires des autres pays de l'Union , des moyens faisant l'objet de son brevet dans le corps du navire, dans les machines, agrès, apparaux et autres accessoires , lorsque ces navires pénétreront temporairement ou accidentellement dans les eaux du pays, sous réserve que ces moyens y soient employés exclusivement pour les besoins du navire ;
2º l'emploi des moyens faisant l'objet du brevet dans la construction ou le fonctionnement des engins de locomotion aérienne ou terrestre des autres pays de l'Union ou des accessoires de ces engins, lorsque ceux-ci pénétreront temporairement ou accidentellement dans ce pays .

ARTICLE 6.

A. Toute marque de fabrique ou de commerce régulièrement enregistrée dans le pays d'origine sera admise au dépôt et protégée telle quelle dans les autres pays de l'Union sous les réserves indiquées ci-après. Ces pays pourront exiger , avant de procéder à l'enregistrement définitif, la production d'un certificat d'enregistrement au pays d'origine délivré par l'autorité compétente . Aucune légalisation [législation ] ne sera requise pour ce certificat.
B.-1. Toutefois, pourront être refusées ou invalidées :
1 ° les marques qui sont de nature à porter atteinte à des droits acquis par des tiers dans le pays où la protection est réclamée ;

53 STAT. ] MULTILATERAL- INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY-JUNE 2, 1934
2º les marques dépourvues de tout caractère distinctif, ou bien composées exclusivement de signes ou d'indications pouvant servir, dans le commerce, pour désigner l'espèce , la qualité, la quantité, la destination, la valeur, le lieu d'origine des produits ou l'époque de production ou devenus usuels dans le langage courant ou les habitudes loyales et constantes du commerce du pays où la protection est réclamée . Dans l'appréciation du caractère distinctif d'une marque, on devra tenir compte de toutes les circonstances de fait , notamment de la durée de l'usage de la marque ;
3º les marques qui sont contraires à la morale ou à l'ordre public , notamment celles qui sont de nature à tromper le public. Il est entendu qu'une marque ne pourra être considérée comme contraire à l'ordre public pour la seule raison qu'elle n'est pas conforme à quelque disposition de la législation sur les marques , sauf le cas où cette disposition elle-même concerne l'ordre public.
2. Ne pourront être refusées dans les autres pays de l'Union les marques de fabrique ou de commerce pour le seul motif qu'elles ne diffèrent des marques protégées dans le pays d'origine que par des éléments n'altérant pas le caractère distinctif et ne touchant pas à l'identité des marques dans la forme sous laquelle celles-ci ont été enregistrées audit pays d'origine.
C. Sera considéré comme pays d'origine le pays de l'Union où le déposant a un établissement industriel ou commercial effectif et sérieux, et, s'il n'a pas un tel établissement, le pays de l'Union où il a son domicile, et , s'il n'a pas de domicile dans l'Union , le pays de sa nationalité, au cas où il est ressortissant d'un pays de l'Union .
D.-Lorsqu'une marque de fabrique ou de commerce aura été régulièrement enregistrée dans le pays d'origine, puis dans un ou plusieurs autres pays de l'Union, chacune de ces marques nationales sera considérée, dès la date à laquelle elle aura été enregistrée, comme indépendante de la marque dans le pays d'origine, pourvu qu'elle soit conforme à la législation intérieure du pays d'importation.
E. En aucun cas le renouvellement de l'enregistrement d'une marque dans le pays d'origine n'entraînera l'obligation de renouveler l'enregistrement dans les autres pays de l'Union où la marque aura été enregistrée.
F. -Le bénéfice de la priorité reste acquis aux dépôts de marques effectués dans le délai de l'article 4 , même lorsque l'enregistrement dans le pays d'origine n'intervient qu'après l'expiration de ce délai .
ARTICLE 6 bis.
1. Les pays de l'Union s'engagent à refuser ou à invalider, soit d'office si la législation du pays le permet, soit à la requête de l'intéressé, l'enregistrement d'une marque de fabrique ou de commerce qui constitue la reproduction , l'imitation ou la traduction , susceptibles de créer une confusion , d'une marque que l'autorité

TREATIES

[53 STAT.

compétente du pays de l'enregistrement estimera y être notoirement connue comme étant déjà la marque d'une personne admise à bénéficier de la présente Convention et utilisée pour des produits identiques ou similaires. Il en sera de même lorsque la partie essentielle de la marque constitue la reproduction d'une telle marque notoirement connue ou une imitation susceptible de créer une confusion avec celle-ci.
2. Un délai minimum de trois ans devra être accordé pour réclamer la radiation de ces marques. Le délai courra de la date de l'enregistrement de la marque.
3. Il ne sera pas fixé de délai pour réclamer la radiation des marques enregistrées de mauvaise foi .

ARTICLE 6 ter.
1. Les pays de l'Union conviennent de refuser ou d'invalider l'enregistrement et d'interdire, par des mesures appropriées , l'utilisation, à défaut d'autorisation des pouvoirs compétents , soit comme marques de fabrique ou de commerce, soit comme éléments de ces marques, des armoiries, drapeaux et autres emblèmes d'Etat des pays de l'Union, signes et poinçons officiels de contrôle et de garantie adoptés par eux, ainsi que toute imitation au point de vue héraldique.
2. L'interdiction des signes et poinçons officiels de contrôle et de garantie s'appliquera seulement dans les cas où les marques qui les comprendront seront destinées à être utilisées sur des marchandises du même genre ou d'un genre similaire.
3. Pour l'application de ces dispositions, les pays de l'Union conviennent de se communiquer réciproquement , par l'intermédiaire du Bureau international de Berne, la liste des emblèmes d'État, signes et poinçons officiels de contrôle et de garantie, qu'ils désirent ou désireront placer, d'une façon absolue ou dans certaines limites, sous la protection du présent article, ainsi que toutes modifications ultérieures apportées à cette liste . Chaque pays de l'Union mettra à la disposition du public , en temps utile, les listes notifiées .
4. Tout pays de l'Union pourra, dans un délai de douze mois à partir de la réception de la notification , transmettre, par l'intermédiaire du Bureau international de Berne, au pays intéressé, ses objections éventuelles .
5. Pour les emblèmes d'État notoirement connus , les mesures
prévues à l'alinéa 1 s'appliqueront seulement aux marques enregistrées après le 6 novembre 1925 .
6. Pour les emblèmes d'État qui ne seraient pas notoirement connus, et pour les signes et poinçons officiels, ces dispositions ne seront applicables qu'aux marques enregistrées plus de deux mois après réception de la notification prévue par l'alinéa 3.
7. En cas de mauvaise foi , les pays auront la faculté de faire radier même les marques enregistrées avant le 6 novembre 1925 et comportant des emblèmes d'État , signes et poinçons.

53 STAT. ] MULTILATERAL- INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY-JUNE 2, 1934
8. Les nationaux de chaque pays qui seraient autorisés à faire usage des emblèmes d'État, signes et poinçons de leur pays, pourront les utiliser, même s'il y avait similitude avec ceux d'un autre pays .
9. Les pays de l'Union s'engagent à interdire l'usage non autorisé , dans le commerce, des armoiries d'État des autres pays de l'Union, lorsque cet usage sera de nature à induire en erreur sur l'origine des produits .
10. Les dispositions qui précèdent ne font pas obstacle à l'exercice , par les pays, de la faculté de refuser ou d'invalider, par application du 3º de l'alinéa 1 de la lettre B de l'article 6 , les marques contenant, sans autorisation , des armoiries, drapeaux, décorations et autres emblèmes d'État ou des signes et poinçons officiels adoptés par un pays de l'Union.
ARTICLE 6 quater.
1. Lorsque, conformément à la législation d'un pays de l'Union, la cession d'une marque n'est valable que si elle a lieu en même temps que le transfert de l'entreprise ou du fonds de commerce auquel la marque appartient , il suffira, pour que cette validité soit admise, que la partie de l'entreprise ou du fonds de commerce située dans ce pays soit transmise au cessionnaire, avec le droit exclusif d'y fabriquer ou d'y vendre les produits portant la marque cédée.
2. Cette disposition n'impose pas aux pays de l'Union l'obligation de considérer comme valable le transfert de toute marque dont l'usage par le cessionnaire serait , en fait, de nature à induire le public en erreur , notamment en ce qui concerne la provenance, la nature ou les qualités substantielles des produits auxquels la marque est appliquée.
ARTICLE 7.
La nature du produit sur lequel la marque de fabrique ou de commerce doit être apposée ne peut , dans aucun cas , faire obstacle à l'enregistrement de la marque.
ARTICLE 7 bis.
1. Les pays de l'Union s'engagent à admettre au dépôt et à protéger les marques collectives appartenant à des collectivités dont l'existence n'est pas contraire à la loi du pays d'origine, même si ces collectivités ne possèdent pas un établissement industriel ou commercial.
2. Chaque pays sera juge des conditions particulières sous lesquelles une marque collective sera protégée et il pourra refuser la protection si cette marque est contraire à l'intérêt public.
3. Cependant, la protection de ces marques ne pourra être refusée à aucune collectivité dont l'existence n'est pas contraire à la loi du pays d'origine, pour le motif qu'elle n'est pas établie dans le pays où la protection est requise ou qu'elle n'est pas constituée conformément à la législation de ce pays .

TREATIES ARTICLE 8 .

[53 STAT.

Le nom commercial sera protégé dans tous les pays de l'Union sans obligation de dépôt ou d'enregistrement , qu'il fasse ou non partie d'une marque de fabrique ou de commerce.
ARTICLE 9.

1. Tout produit portant illicitement une marque de fabrique ou de commerce, ou un nom commercial , sera saisi à l'importation dans ceux des pays de l'Union dans lesquels cette marque ou ce nom commercial ont droit à la protection légale.
2. La saisie sera également effectuée dans le pays où l'apposition illicite aura eu lieu , ou dans le pays où aura été importé le produit.
3. La saisie aura lieu à la requête soit du ministère public , soit de toute autre autorité compétente , soit d'une partie intéressée, personne physique ou morale , conformément à la législation intérieure de chaque pays.
4. Les autorités ne seront pas tenues d'effectuer la saisie en cas de transit.
5. Si la législation d'un pays n'admet pas la saisie à l'importation , la saisie sera remplacée par la prohibition d'importation ou la saisie à l'intérieur .
6. Si la législation d'un pays n'admet ni la saisie à l'importation, ni la prohibition d'importation , ni la saisie à l'intérieur , et en attendant que cette législation soit modifiée en conséquence, ces mesures seront remplacées par les actions et moyens que la loi de ce pays assurerait en pareil cas aux nationaux.

ARTICLE 10.
1. Les dispositions de l'article précédent seront applicables à tout produit portant faussement, comme indication de provenance, le nom d'une localité ou d'un pays déterminé, lorsque cette indication sera jointe à un nom commercial fictif ou emprunté dans une intention frauduleuse .
2. Sera en tout cas reconnu comme partie intéressée, que ce soit une personne physique ou morale, tout producteur, fabricant ou commerçant engagé dans la production , la fabrication ou le commerce de ce produit et établi , soit dans la localité faussement indiquée comme lieu de provenance, soit dans la région où cette localité est située , soit dans le pays faussement indiqué, soit dans le pays où la fausse indication de provenance est employée.

ARTICLE 10 bis.
1. Les pays de l'Union sont tenus d'assurer aux ressortissants de l'Union une protection effective contre la concurrence déloyale.
2. Constitue un acte de concurrence déloyale tout acte de concurrence contraire aux usages honnêtes en matière industrielle ou commerciale .

53 STAT.] MULTILATERAL- INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY-JUNE 2, 1934
3. Notamment devront être interdits : 1° tous faits quelconques de nature à créer une confusion par
n'importe quel moyen avec l'établissement , les produits ou l'activité industrielle ou commerciale d'un concurrent ; 2º les allégations fausses, dans l'exercice du commerce, de nature à discréditer l'établissement, les produits ou l'activité industrielle ou commerciale d'un concurrent .
ARTICLE 10 ter.

nature relatifs à la protection de la propriété industrielle ; il les réunit

et les publie. Il procède aux études d'utilité commune intéressant

l'Union et rédige, à l'aide des documents qui sont mis à sa disposition

par les diverses Administrations, une feuille périodique, en langue française, sur les questions concernant l'objet de l'Union .

4. Les numéros de cette feuille, de même que tous les documents publiés par le Bureau international , sont répartis entre les Adminis-

ARTICLE 6

Trade mark registration and protection. A. Every trade mark duly registered in the country of origin shall
be admitted for registration and protected in the form originally
registered in the other countries of the Union under the reservations
indicated below. These countries can demand , before proceeding to a

final registration, the production of a certificate of registration in the

country of origin issued by the competent authority . No legislation
shall be required for this certificate. Marks subject to refusal or cancelation. B. (1 ) Nevertheless, the following marks may be refused or
canceled :

1º. Those which are of such a nature as to infringe upon rights

acquired by third parties in the country where protection is applied for .

2º. Those which have no distinctive character, or which consist

exclusively of signs or indications which serve in trade to designate the kind, quality, quantity, destination, value, place of origin of the

products, or time of production, or which have become customary in the current language, or in the bona fide and unquestioned usages of the trade in the country in which protection is sought. In arriving

at a decision as to the distinctiveness of the character of a mark, all the circumstances of the case must be taken into account, and in

particular the length of time that such a mark has been in use. 3º. Those which are contrary to morality or public order, especially
those which are of a nature to deceive the public. It is to be understood that a mark cannot be considered as contrary to public order for the sole reason that it does not conform to some legislative requirement concerning trade marks , except in circumstances where this requirement itself concerns public order.
(2) Trade marks cannot be refused in the other countries of the

Union on the sole ground that they only differ from the marks pro-

tected in the country of origin by elements not altering the distinctive

character and not affecting the identity of the marks in the form under

which they have been registered in the aforesaid country of origin.

Country of origin

Assignments.

ARTICLE 6 quater
(1) When in accordance with the laws of a country of the Union the assignment of a mark is valid only if it takes place at the same time as the transfer of the enterprise or business and goodwill to which the mark belongs , it will suffice , for the admission of the validity of such transfer, that the part of the enterprise or business and goodwill which is located in this country be transferred to the assignee with the exclusive right therein to manufacture or sell products under the mark which has been assigned.
(2) This provision shall not impose upon the countries of the Union the obligation of considering as valid the transfer of any mark whose use by the assignee would , in fact , be of such a nature as to deceive the public, especially as regards the place of origin , the nature, or the material qualities of the products to which the mark is applied .

INTERNATIONAL WHALING CONFERENCE, LONDON JUNE 1938 .

FINAL ACT OF THE CONFERENCE.

1. In accordance with the Recommendation contained in paragraph 11 of the Final Act, signed in London on the 8th June, 1937, a further Conference met in London on the 14th June, 1938 , and subsequent days to consider modifications or extensions of the existing Agreement, hereinafter referred to as the Principal Agreement .
2. The following Governments sent Delegates to the Conference: Union of South Africa, United States of America, Argentina, Australia, Canada, Denmark, Eire, France, Germany, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland , Japan, New Zealand and Norway. An observer also attended on behalf of the Portuguese Government, and the interests of Newfoundland were watched by the United Kingdom Delegation.
3. The Principal Agreement has been ratified by the Governments of Eire, Germany, Norway, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and United States of America, whilst Canada and Mexico have since acceded to it . With regard to the remaining signatory Governments, New Zealand has actually ratified the Principal Agreement.
The Argentine Republic is enforcing the Principal Agreement by Executive Decree, and formal ratification is only a matter of time. The Conference understands that ratification of the Principal Agreement by the Governments of the Commonwealth of Australia and of the Union of South Africa has been delayed only by constitutional difficulties. The Conference is confident that these Governments will take steps at the earliest possible moment to remove these difficulties and to ratify. The Government of Denmark has notified its intention of acceding to the Principal Agreement and the Protocol as soon as the necessary powers to enforce their provisions have been obtained by legislation . The Government of France is prepared to accede to the Principal Agreement subject to certain reservations affecting land stations, which are dealt with later in this Act . Towards the end of the proceedings of the Conference the Japanese Delegation informed the Conference that their Government was prepared to take the necessary legislative and other measures to enable them to accede to the Principal Agreement and the Protocol after an interval of a year subject to a reservation in respect of the first paragraph of Article 3 of the Protocol . The Japanese Government is also prepared to observe the principles of the present Agreement as nearly as possible in the meantime. There is no information at present available as to the attitude of Portugal and the Government of Newfoundland has reserved its decision.
4. The necessary majority required by Article 21 of the Principal Agreement for the extension of its duration after the 30th June, 1938, has been secured.

53 STAT. ] MULTILATERAL- REGULATION OF WHALING- JUNE 24, 1938
5. The Conference took note of the fact that, according to the statistics of the catch of the last Antarctic season, the opinion expressed in paragraph 2 of the Final Act of the Conference of 1937 , that the Principal Agreement was likely to go far in maintaining the stock of whales, had not been justified by the event, inasmuch as the actual number of whales killed (approximately 44,000) and the number of barrels of oil produced (approximately 3,250,000 ) were, respectively, some 10,000 and 600,000 in excess of the corresponding figures for the previous season.
6. The Conference had also before it a Resolution of the Whaling Committee of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, which met in Copenhagen on the 23rd May, 1938 , in the following terms:
"The Committee, viewing with alarm the evident decline of the stock of Blue Whales , is of opinion that nothing less than a limitation of the total amount of whale oil which may be taken in any whaling season can be effective in preserving the stock of Blue Whales from being reduced to the level at which it can no longer be the object of economic exploitation."
This resolution was adopted by the Council at its concluding Meeting on the 28th May, 1938, with a request that it should be brought to the notice of the Members of the present Conference.
7. In the light of the facts set forth in paragraph 5 above, and the terms of the above Resolution of the Whaling Committee of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, the Conference considered the following measures of general application which might be expected to limit the destruction of whales :-
(a) a further reduction of the open season ; (b) a limitation of the number of catchers which might be used
in connection with each expedition ; (c) an overhead limitation of output during the Antarctic whaling
season, by which is meant that a limit of output should be fixed, after which all whaling should cease, though the limit might be reached before the end of the open season ; (d) the fixing of a maximum oil production which no expedition should exceed in any one Antarctic season ; (e) special measures of protection for humpback whales ; ( the establishment of a sanctuary in waters south of 40 ° South Latitude ; (g) the closure of additional areas against pelagic whaling.
8. With regard to method (a) in the foregoing paragraph, the Conference agreed, with the exception of the Japanese Delegation, who reserved their position for the season 1938-39, that the open season provided for in Article 7 of the Principal Agreement, that is to say, from the 8th day of December to the 7th day of March following, should be maintained . It was felt that few, if any, expeditions would be able to engage profitably in whaling if the open season in the Antarctic were further curtailed ; and that a further curtailment of the

1801

1802

TREATIES

[ 53 STAT.

open season would increase the temptation to evade the provisions of Articles 11 and 12 of the Principal Agreement, which are designed to secure that the fullest possible use shall be made of all whales taken.
9. With regard to method (b ) , a proposal was put forward that the number of whale catchers attached to any expedition should be limited to seven, but the Conference was unable to reach agreement either upon this proposal or upon any limitation in the number of whale catchers .
10. Although method (c) was advocated by the Whaling Committee of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea as the most effective restriction of undue exploitation of the whale stock , the Conference did not feel able at the present time to recommend its adoption .
11. The Conference could not agree on the application of method (d). In particular , objection was taken to this method on the ground that its incidence would be unfair, in that it would limit the operations of the most efficient factory ships and have little, if any, effect upon the operations of the smaller and less efficient factory ships . The question whether different maxima might be fixed for different expeditions according to their capacity was raised , but it was clear that agreement would not be reached on this basis.
12. Although the Conference was unable to agree to the immediate adoption of methods (b) , (c) or (d) , there was a strong feeling that these were matters calling for further expert examination by all the Governments concerned , with a view to their consideration at a subsequent Conference .
13. With regard to method (e) , attention was drawn to a Report recently issued by the Discovery Committee concerning the condition of the stock of humpback whales and to other evidence pointing to a serious decline of that stock, and the Conference appointed a Committee to study this question . The Committee reported that there was ample biological evidence to show that the humpback stock was in very serious danger in all sectors of the southern hemisphere, and recommended that there should be no hunting of this species of whale for at least a year in any waters, or at least in the southern hemisphere and North Atlantic and dependent waters . It proved impossible to obtain the general agreement of the Conference to this proposal, chiefly because some land stations depend mainly upon humpbacks for their output of oil, and it was contended that the total prohibition, even for one year, of the hunting of humpbacks would have an effect on these land stations disproportionate to that which it would have on pelagic expeditions. The Conference, therefore, while admitting the desirability of a total prohibition, agreed that, in the first instance, the hunting of humpbacks by means of pelagic expeditions should be prohibited in the waters south of 40 ° South Latitude. A provision to this effect has consequently been embodied in the Protocol (Article 1 ) . It is hoped that this measure of protection, coupled with the immunity which all baleen whales would enjoy in the greater part of the waters north of 40 ° South

53 STAT. ] MULTILATERAL- REGULATION OF WHALING JUNE 24, 1938
Latitude, should have useful results, and the Conference strongly recommends the Governments represented thereat and other Governments concerned to study this question further with a view to give complete protection to humpback whales for a suitable period after the 30th September, 1939 .
14. With regard to method (f), the Conference agreed that the sector of the waters south of 40 ° South Latitude which lies between 70° West Longitude and 160 ° West Longitude should be a sanctuary for whales for at least two years, and provision has been made accordingly in the Protocol (Article 2 ) . In this sector commercial whaling has not hitherto been prosecuted , but the evidence acquired by the Discovery Committee shows that it is frequented by baleen whales, and the Conference agreed that it was highly desirable that the immunity which whales in this area had hitherto enjoyed should be maintained. Little information is available as to the extent to which whales from this area travel into the adjoining areas, or vice versa, but there is reason to think that such movement does, to some extent, take place, and that therefore the protection provided in this area may have useful results.
15. With regard to method (g) , certain doubts having arisen already as to the limits of the Greenland Sea referred to in Article 9 of the Principal Agreement and as to the extent to which the Arctic Ocean is included within the area protected by that Article, it was suggested that the whole of the waters North of 66 ° North Latitude should be brought under protection, and that to the Atlantic and Indian Oceans and to the closed areas of the Pacific Ocean should be added their respective dependent waters . The Japanese Delegation , however, asked for a concession permitting whaling in the Arctic Ocean north of the Pacific Ocean, between 66 ° North Latitude and 72 ° North Latitude. In view of the satisfactory declaration as to the position of the Japanese Government referred to in paragraph 3 , the Conference agreed to exclude these waters from the restriction. Provision to meet these points has accordingly been made in the Protocol (Article 7) .
16. In the fifth paragraph of the Final Act of the Conference of last year attention was drawn to the risk that the restrictions imposed on pelagic whaling might lead to a development of whaling from land stations, and the Governments were accordingly advised to place themselves in a position to check or regulate such development should it occur. Since the Conference of last year an unforeseen development has occurred owing to the assumption in certain quarters that, in spite of the provisions of Article 9 of the Principal Agreement, it was legitimate to use a factory ship as a temporary "land station " when it remained within the territorial waters of a State. In the opinion of the Conference as a whole (United States of America Delegation dissenting) , the wording of Article 9 of the Principal Agreement prohibits the use of a factory ship for treating whales in the whole of the areas specified, without exception . Briefly, the majority view of the Conference is that a factory ship does not lose its character of

1803

1804

TREATIES

[53 STAT.

being a ship until at least it loses its power of independent movement, and that a factory ship moored in territorial waters is no less a ship than any other ship which drops its anchor or is moored in a port. Although the Conference has no doubt of the correctness of this interpretation of Article 9 , it has been thought desirable , in view of the events which have occurred , to embody in the Protocol an Article (Article 3 ) which, while placing beyond doubt the fact that it is not permissible to use a factory ship as a "land station, " nevertheless makes a concession in respect of existing enterprises.
17. The French Delegation declared that the French Government was ready to accede to the present Agreement subject to the following reservations :-
First, that the term "land station" employed in the Principal Agreement means a factory on land or a factory placed near the coast on a construction fixed or anchored at the same spot during the whole of the hunting season, and one which cannot be subsequently employed as a factory ship fishing in the deep sea.
Secondly, should any regulations be introduced regulating the number of land stations as thus defined , France reserves the right to establish or to maintain three of such stations in her possessions in the Southern hemisphere.
In view of the provisions of Article 3 of the Protocol , coupled with the statement in paragraph 16 of this Final Act, the first reservation of the French Government appears to be satisfied . Furthermore, there is no provision in the Protocol regulating the number of land stations . The way, therefore, is clear for the accession of the Government of the French Republic .
18. It was represented to the Conference by the Danish Delegation that in the Faroe Islands whale hunting was prosecuted mainly to provide food in the form of whale meat for the population of the Islands, and that hitherto whaling had been conducted from two land stations in the Faroe Islands without regard to size limits . They intimated that it would be necessary for them, in order to accede to the Principal Agreement, which Denmark was otherwise ready to accept , to make a reservation in respect of size limits so far as they affected these stations . To meet this particular case and other cases of a similar character, the Conference agreed to attach a proviso to Article 5 of the Principal Agreement . The Protocol (Article 4) provides that the size limit for blue, fin and sperm whales applicable to whales taken by catchers working from land stations may be reduced by 5 feet in each instance provided that the meat of such whales is to be used for local consumption . It is understood that this provision is to be limited in its application to stations which are genuinely intended to supply the local needs of the country in which the station is situated .
19. It was agreed that Article 7 of the Principal Agreement should be amended so as to allow of the treatment of whales after the end of the open season provided that they were killed before midnight on the 7th March. Provision has been made accordingly in the Protocol (Article 5).

53 STAT. ] MULTILATERAL- REGULATION OF WHALING- JUNE 24, 1938
20. The Conference considered a statement by the Japanese Delegation with regard to the effect of Article 8 of the Principal Agreement upon land stations in Japan , some of which actually operate for more than six months in any one year, a considerable portion of the catch consisting of sperm whales. In order to meet so far as possible the case of such land stations, the Conference agreed to confine the application of Article 8 to baleen whales, and an amendment to this effect has been included in the Protocol (Article 6 ) .
21. The Conference having considered reports to the effect that some difficulty has been experienced in the application of Article 12 of the Principal Agreement, the purpose of which is to limit the period between the killing and the treatment of a whale, it was agreed to remove the uncertainty as to the exact interpretation of the Article by redrafting it on different lines with the same purpose in view. Provision has been made accordingly in the Protocol (Article 8 ).
22. The Conference learned with concern that during the Antarctic whaling season of 1936-37 , and the summer of 1937, no less than 15 right whales had been killed . They were informed that some of these whales had been measured, and among them four foetuses were found, the lengths of which were approximately 20 feet, 19 feet, 17 feet and 1 foot respectively. Some of these whales were taken by nationals of Governments which were signatories to the Principal Agreement. The Conference desires to draw the attention of the Governments concerned to these breaches of the Geneva Convention and the Principal Agreement. From the commercial point of view, little advantage can accrue to any expedition by the taking of the few right whales that still exist, and , in the opinion of the Conference, it is deplorable not only that right whales should be killed in spite of the provisions of the Principal Agreement, but that, in particular, as the statistics prove, breeding right whales should have been killed . The Conference, therefore , expresses the hope that, with a view to the preservation of the remainder of these most interesting mammals, the Governments concerned should sternly enforce the provisions of Article 4 of the Principal Agreement .
23. The Conference took note of a statement by Dr. Mackintosh of the proposals of the Discovery Committee for enlisting the support of whaling enterprises in the continuation and development of whale marking as carried out by the Committee. The Conference also heard a statement from the German Delegation as to the steps which the German Government proposes to take for the marking of whales . The Conference expressed the hope that the Governments and the whaling enterprises concerned will do their best to encourage the development of whale marking, which, in the view of the Conference , is likely to make an important contribution to the knowledge of the movement of whales, which has a very close bearing upon the problem of conservation of whales.
24. With reference to paragraph 9 of the Final Act of the Conference of 1937, it was reported that the Governments of Germany and

Norway had acquired the necessary powers to deal with transfers of ships registered in their territories, and that the Government of the United States of America already possessed those powers . The Conference expressed the hope that other countries would take steps to acquire similar powers at an early date.
25. In conclusion, the Conference suggested that the question of holding a future Conference should be left to the consideration of the Governments concerned, in the light of developments .

LEGACIÓN DE PANAMÁ WASHINGTON Marzo 2 de 1936

En relación con la parte del Artículo III del tratado firmado hoy en que se especifican las personas que tienen derecho de residir en la Zona del Canal, tenemos a honra manifestar a nombre de nuestro Gobierno que las restricciones establecidas en materia de residencia no afectan en manera alguna a los huéspedes de los hoteles que el Canal de Panamá o la Compañía del Ferrocarril de Panamá mantienen y administran por cuenta del Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de América en la Zona del Canal, puesto que tales huéspedes al ingresar a dichos hoteles no van a la Zona en calidad de residentes sino de transeuntes y el objeto de su estada en la Zona del Canal por tiempo indeterminado no es el de establecer domicilio permanente allí .

Es igualmente entendido que las restricciones tampoco alcanzan a las personas que deseen establecer domicilio permanente en algún hotel de la Zona del Canal, siempre que esas personas sean de las que

tienen derecho de residir en la Zona, de conformidad con la Sección 2ª
del Artículo III del tratado a que dejamos hecha referencia. Deseamos dejar constancia de la honda complacencia que nos ha
producido la manifestación hecha por los representantes del Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de América durante las negociaciones del tratado , de que el Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de América no tiene la intención ni el deseo de competir con la industria panameña . También nos es grato saber que en lo tocante al negocio de hoteles en la Zona del Canal , éstos fueron establecidos con la mira de llenar las necesidades del tráfico de pasajeros en época en que los hoteles establecidos en Panamá no estaban enteramente capacitados para ello ; que tan pronto como esta situación cambie satisfactoriamente se dejará el negocio de hoteles enteramente en manos de la industria establecida en Panamá, y que la prosperidad de la República de Panamá en ésta, como en otras materias, es vehementemente deseada por los Estados Unidos de América.

SIR:

Washington, March 2, 1936.

In connection with the part of Article III of the treaty signed today, in which the persons are specified who have a right to reside in the Canal Zone, we have the honor to state in the name of our Government that the restrictions established in the matter of resi-

dence in no wise affect the guests of hotels which the Panama Canal

or the Panama Railroad Company maintains and manages for account of the Government of the United States of America in the

Canal Zone, as such guests in entering such hotels do not go to the Zone as residents but as transients and the object of their stay in the Canal Zone for an indeterminate period is not to establish a permanent domicile there.
It is also understood that the restrictions do not apply to persons who wish to establish a permanent residence in any hotel in the Canal Zone either, provided such persons are among the number of those who have a right to reside in the Zone , in accordance with Section 2 of Article III of the treaty to which we have referred .
We wish to express our great pleasure at the statement made by the representatives of the Government of the United States of America during the negotiation of the treaty, that it is not the intention or desire of the Government of the United States of America to compete

with Panamanian industry. We are also pleased to know with respect to the hotels in the Canal Zone that they were established

for the purpose of meeting the necessities of the passenger traffic at a time when the hotels established in Panama were not entirely in

position to do so ; that as soon as this situation is satisfactorily altered the hotel business proper will be left in the hands of the industry established in Panama, and that the prosperity of the Republic of

Panama in this, as in other respects, is earnestly desired by the United States of America.

SIRS :

March 2, 1936

With reference to the question of the sale to ships of goods imported into the Canal Zone by the Government of the United States of

America, I have the honor to advise you that it will be the policy of this Government to effect such sales on the following basis:

Articles classed by the Panama Canal as "ships stores" , such as articles, materials and supplies necessary for the navigation , propulsion and upkeep of vessels, will continue to be sold as at present ;
Articles classed by the Panama Canal as tourist or luxury goods will not be sold to ships ;
Articles classed by the Panama Canal as "sea stores " , such as articles for the use or consumption of the passengers and crew of the ship upon its voyage, and articles of other classes, will be sold at prices which, in the judgment of the Government of the United States of America and insofar as may appear feasible, will afford merchants of Panama fair opportunity to sell on equal terms. To arrive at the prices at which these articles will be sold to ships the retail prices of such articles to Canal Zone employees will be taken as a base, and a surcharge added thereto, when necessary; and no discount for purchases of large quantities will be granted to ships making such purchases.

For your information I am enclosing herewith four lists illustrative but not in any sense exhaustive of the various articles included in the four classes mentioned above , namely: ( 1 ) ships stores ; (2 ) tourist or luxury goods ; (3) sea stores ; and , (4 ) articles of other classes.
It is the hope of the Government of the United States of America that in benefit of Panamanian commerce merchants of Panama may be able to furnish in satisfactory quantities and qualities and at reasonable prices many or all of the articles classed as "sea stores" and as "articles of other classes" purchased by ships arriving at terininal ports of the Canal or transiting the Canal. It will be the policy of the United States of America that whenever and for so long as merchants of Panama are in fact able to furnish certain articles as so described in satisfactory quantities and qualities and at reasonable prices , the Canal Zone commissaries will refrain from selling like articles to ships.

In accordance with the policy of affording merchants of Panama full opportunity for making sales to ships, the launch facilities now employed by the Government of the United States of America in effecting sales to ships will be made available on equal terms to merchants of Panama, subject to appropriate administrative regulations of the Canal Zone.
The Governor of the Panama Canal will be prepared to appoint a representative to meet with a representative of Panamanian commerce appointed by your Government, in order that regular and continuing opportunity may be afforded for mutual conference and helpful exchange of views bearing on these questions, including the amount of the surcharge to be established, when necessary, in connection with "sea stores" and "articles of other classes" .

Vuestra Excelencia , por medio de la cual se sirve expresarnos cual

será la política de los Estados Unidos de América en lo relativo a la

venta a las naves de artículos importados por los Estados Unidos de América a la Zona del Canal.

Acerca de este asunto la República de Panamá debe hacer reserva expresa de sus derechos , conforme a su concepto de que las exenciones. de que trata el Artículo XIII de la Convención de 18 de Noviembre de 1903 fueron pactadas exclusivamente en beneficio de la empresa del Canal, de las personas al servicio de los Estados Unidos de América

en relación con el mismo y de sus familias ; pero mientras se llega a un entendimiento respecto de este asunto el Gobierno panameño desea expresar la grata satisfacción que le causa la decisión del Go-

bierno de los Estados Unidos de América de poner en vigor medidas

como las expuestas en la nota que contestamos , para el efecto de restringir las ventas a las naves, que en épocas anteriores a la presente habían venido haciéndose sin limitación alguna . Igual satisfacción

causa al Gobierno panameño el propósito fundamental que pone de manifiesto la nota en referencia de dejar en manos de los comerciantes de Panamá el negocio de aprovisionamiento de los buques que lleguen

a los puertos terminales del canal o que pasen por el canal y de abstenerse el Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de América de hacer aquellas ventas, mientras los comerciantes de Panamá muestren efectivamente

su capacidad de suministrar mercancías a las naves en cantidades y calidades satisfactorias y a precios razonables .
Nuestro Gobierno está dispuesto a nombrar un representante escogido por el Comercio de Panamá para entenderse con un representante de la Administración del Canal, a fin de que haya así oportunidad regular y continua de consulta y de cooperación para la realización de los fines arriba expresados.

LEGATION OF PANAMA,

SIR :

Washington, March 2, 1936.

We have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of Your Excellency's kind communication , in which you indicate what will be the policy of the United States of America in regard to the sale to ships of articles imported by the United States into the Canal Zone.

With regard to this matter the Government of the Republic of Panama must make a special reservation of its rights , in conformity with its opinion that the exemptions covered by Article XIII of the

Convention of November 18, 1903 , were stipulated exclusively for the benefit of the Canal enterprise, of the persons in the service of the United States of America in connection therewith, and of their families ;

but until an understanding is reached regarding this matter, the Panamanian Government desires to express its deep satisfaction at the decision of the Government of the United States of America to

put into effect measures such as those set forth in the note to which this is a reply, for the purpose of restricting sales to ships , which in former times had been made without any limitation . The Panamanian Government feels an equal satisfaction at the basic purpose set

forth in the said note that the business of provisioning vessels arriving at terminal ports of the Canal or transiting the Canal will be left in the hands of the merchants of Panama and that the Government of

the United States of America will abstain from making such sales whenever and for so long as merchants of Panama effectively demon-

strate their ability to supply merchandise to vessels in satisfactory quantities and qualities and at reasonable prices.
Our Government is prepared to appoint a representative selected by the business men of Panama to come to meet with a representative of the Canal Administration , in order that regular and continuing

opportunity may be afforded for conference and cooperation for the accomplishment of the above-mentioned purposes.

Accept, Sir, the renewed assurances of our highest consideration. R. J. ALFARO NARCISO GARAY

LEGACIÓN DE PANAMÁ WASHINGTON Marzo 2 de 1936

En el curso de las recientes negociaciones para la revisión de la Convención de 18 de Noviembre de 1903 , llamamos la atención de su Gobierno sobre ciertas cuestiones que han surgido con respecto a la

parte del Artículo VII de la citada Convención que se refiere a la construcción por los Estados Unidos de América de los acueductos y

albañales de las ciudades de Panamá y Colón , y a la amortización de su costo dentro de un período de cincuenta años , pensando al principio que estos asuntos podían solucionarse durante las negociaciones .
Se encontró, sin embargo, que para llegar a un completo acuerdo sobre estos asuntos se necesitaría un examen largo, cuidadoso y completo de sus aspectos técnico , legal y financiero, y por lo tanto , se convino dejar en suspenso la discusión formal de estas cuestiones y que después de la terminación del nuevo tratado los dos Gobiernos procederían a discutirlas amigablemente con el fin de llegar a un acuerdo equitativo y mutuamente satisfactorio .
Nuestro Gobierno entiende que estas discusiones envolverán un estudio de los contratos del 30 de Septiembre de 1910 , celebrados entre el Gobierno de la República de Panamá y la Comisión del Canal Istmico , y un examen de las cuentas entre las dos administraciones , relativas a las tarifas de agua de las ciudades de Panamá y Colón. A este respecto se cree que debe darse la debida consideración , entre otras cosas, a las representaciones hechas por la Comisión Panameña

en el curso de las recientes negociaciones , y especialmente a su Memorandum del 12 de Marzo de 1935 y a su Aide-Memoire del 14 de Agosto de 1935.

LEGATION OF PANAMA,

SIR:

Washington, March 2, 1936.

In the course of the recent negotiations for a revision of the Conven-

tion of November 18 , 1903 , we have brought to the attention of your Government certain questions which have arisen in respect of that part of Article VII of the said Convention which refers to the con-

struction by the United States of America of the water works and sewers in the cities of Panamá and Colón, and to the amortization of

the cost thereof within a period of fifty years, thinking at first that these matters could be disposed of during the negotiations .
It was found, however, that to reach a complete understanding of these matters a long, painstaking and exhaustive examination of the

technical, legal and financial aspects thereof would be required , and it was therefore decided that formal discussion of these questions

would be held in abeyance and that after the conclusion of the new treaty the two Governments would engage in friendly discussions in an endeavor to arrive at a fair and mutually satisfactory agreement.
It is the understanding of our Government that such discussions

will involve a study of the contracts of September 30 , 1910 , between the Government of the Republic of Panama and the Isthmian Canal Commission, and an examination of the accounts between the two administrations relating to water rates in the cities of Panamá and Colón. In this connection it is believed that due consideration should

be given, among other things, to the representations made by the

Panamanian Commission in the course of the recent negotiations , and

especially to its memorandum of March 12 , 1935 , and its AideMemoire of August 14 , 1935.

SIRS : I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your note of today's
date, reading as follows:
"In the course of the recent negotiations for a revision of the Convention of November 18 , 1903 , we have brought to the attention of your Government certain questions which have arisen in respect of that part of Article VII of the said Convention which refers to the construction by the United States of America

[53 STAT.

of the water works and sewers in the cities of Panamá and Colón, and to the amortization of the cost thereof within a period of fifty years, thinking at first that these matters could be disposed of during the negotiations.
"Itwas found , however, that to reach a complete understanding of these matters a long, painstaking and exhaustive examination of the technical, legal and financial aspects thereof would be required, and it was therefore decided that formal discussion of these questions would be held in abeyance and that after the conclusion of the new treaty the two Governments would engage in friendly discussions in an endeavor to arrive at a fair and mutually satisfactory agreement.
"It is the understanding of our Government that such discussions will involve a study of the contracts of September 30, 1910 , between the Government of the Republic of Panama and the Isthmian Canal Commission, and an examination of the accounts between the two administrations relating to water rates in the cities of Panamá and Colón . In this connection it is believed that due consideration should be given, among other things, to the representations made by the Panamanian Commission in the course of the recent negotiations, and especially to its memorandum of March 12, 1935 , and its Aide-Memoire of August 14, 1935. "
In reply I have the honor to advise you that the Government of the United States of America, in accordance with the procedure
outlined in your note under reference, will be pleased to instruct the American Minister in Panama to arrange for conversations between
the appropriate authorities of the Republic of Panama and of the Canal Zone in order that the Government of the Republic of Panama may present such specific proposals in the premises as it may desire, and in order that an opportunity may thus be afforded for reaching an agreement on these matters satisfactory to both Governments.
Accept, Sirs, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration . CORDELL HULL

SIRS :

DEPARTMENT OF STATE WASHINGTON March 2, 1936

I have the honor to refer to our conversations with respect to the effect upon the Monetary Agreement of June 20 , 1904 , between the United States of America and the Republic of Panama as modified by the exchanges of notes of March 26-April 2 , 1930, and of May 28June 6, 1931 , of the action taken by the President of the United States of America in his Proclamation of January 31 , 1934, reducing

the weight of the gold dollar of the United States of America. It has been recognized that, as a result of this action, the provision
of the Monetary Agreement that the monetary unit of the Republic of Panama should be a gold Balboa of the weight of one gram, 672

milligrams, nine-tenths fine , is no longer consistent with the necessary condition of the Agreement that the standard unit of value of the United States of America, the dollar, and the standard unit of value of the Republic of Panama, the Balboa , should continue at a parity at the rate of one dollar for one Balboa. It has also been recognized that in the Republic of Panama and in the Canal Zone silver Balboas and fractional currency of the Republic are circulating together with United States currency at the rate of one Balboa for one dollar.
For these reasons , it is desirable that the existing Monetary Agreement, as modified , be further modified to make provision for the reduction of the weight of the gold Balboa so that the legal standard units of value of the Republic of Panama and of the United States of America shall be equal. Accordingly, for the purpose of Article VII of the General Treaty signed today, the Balboa shall be regarded as defined to consist of 987½ milligrams of gold of 0.900 fineness.
It is understood that the reduction in the weight of the gold Balboa shall not necessitate an alteration of the weight of the silver coins of the Republic of Panama, but that these shall continue to be of the same size, weight and fineness as at present.
Notwithstanding any language contained in the existing Monetary Agreement , as modified , which has been interpreted or might be interpreted as limiting the number of coins of any denomination to be issued by the Republic of Panama within the total amount of coins of all denominations, it is now understood and agreed that the Monetary Agreement, as modified , shall not be considered as contemplating any such limitation, so that, as long as such total amount is not exceeded , that total amount may be apportioned among the coins of the various denominations referred to in the Agreement as may seem fitting to the

Government of the Republic of Panama. As a further modification of the existing Monetary Agreement, it
is agreed that the Government of the United States of America shall

not be required to accept Panamanian silver currency for the payment of tolls for the use of the Panama Canal .

LEGACIÓN DE PANAMÁ WASHINGTON Marzo 2 de 1936
SEÑOR: Tenemos el honor de acusar recibo de la comunicación de Vuestra
Excelencia que dice lo siguiente :
"Tengo el honor de referirme a nuestras conversaciones acerca del efecto que tuvo sobre el Convenio Monetario de 20 de Junio de 1904 entre la República de Panamá y los Estados Unidos de América, modificado por los canjes de notas de Marzo 26 y Abril 2 de 1930, y de Mayo 28 y Junio 6 de 1931 , lo dispuesto por el Presidente de los Estados Unidos de América en su Proclama de 31 de Enero de 1934 , por la cual se redujo el peso del dólar de oro de los Estados Unidos de América .
"Se ha reconocido que, como resultado de esta medida, la estipulación del Convenio Monetario de que la unidad monetaria de la República de Panamá debe ser un Balboa de oro con peso de 1 gramo, 672 miligramos, de 0.900 de fino , no es ya compatible con la condición necesaria del Convenio de que la unidad monetaria de los Estados Unidos de América, el dólar, y la unidad monetaria de la República de Panamá , el Balboa, deben mantenerse a la par , a razón de un dólar por un Balboa. Se ha reconocido también que en la República de Panamá y en la Zona del Canal los Balboas de plata y la moneda fraccionaria de la República están circulando junto con la moneda de los Estados Unidos a razón de un Balboa por un dólar.
"Por estas razones es conveniente que el actual Convenio Monetario con sus modificaciones, sea modificado de nuevo, a fin de proveer a la reducción del peso del Balboa de oro , de manera que el patrón legal de valor de la República de Panamá y el de los Estados Unidos de América sean iguales. En concordancia con lo anterior, para los efectos del Artículo VII del Tratado General firmado hoy, se considerará el Balboa definido como una unidad monetaria de novecientos ochenta y siete y medio miligramos (Gr. 0.9875) de oro de novecientos milésimos (0.900) de fino.
"Es entendido que la reducción del peso del Balboa de oro no implica alteración en el peso de las monedas de plata de la Repú-

53 STAT. ] PANAMA--FRIENDSHIP AND COOPERATION- MAR. 2, 1936

blica de Panamá, sino que ellas continuarán teniendo el mismo tamaño, peso y ley que tienen ahora.
"No obstante cualesquiera términos contenidos en el Convenio Monetario existente, con sus modificaciones, que hayan sido o puedan ser interpretados en el sentido de que limitan la cantidad de monedas de cualquiera denominación que Panamá acuñe dentro de la suma total de monedas de todas las denominaciones, queda ahora entendido y convenido que el Convenio Monetario , con sus modificaciones, no tiene en mira tal limitación , de manera que si la cantidad total no es excedida, esa cantidad total puede repartirse como lo tenga a bien el Gobierno de la República de Panamá entre las monedas de las diferentes denominaciones a que el Convenio se refiere.
"Como modificación adicional del Convenio Monetario existente, se conviene que el Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de América no estará obligado a aceptar la moneda de plata panameña para el pago de peajes por el uso del Canal de Panamá.
"Puedo decir que las anteriores inteligencias y acuerdos son aceptables a mi Gobierno, y que al recibir una comunicación por medio de la cual sean confirmados a nombre del Gobierno de la República de Panamá, el Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de América considerará modificado nuevamente , en los términos que quedan expresados , el Convenio Monetario del 20 de Junio de 1904 , con sus modificaciones ".

Nuestro Gobierno confirma las inteligencias y acuerdos expresados en la nota que contestamos, y por tanto, el Gobierno de la República de Panamá considerará nuevamente modificado en los términos allí expuestos, el Convenio Monetario del 20 de Junio de 1904, con sus modificaciones .

DEPARTMENT OF STATE WASHINGTON

SIR :

February 1 , 1939

I have the honor to refer to the General Treaty signed between the United States of America and the Republic of Panama on March 2, 1936 and to the record of the proceedings of the negotiations leading

to this accord. As you may recall, on several occasions during the course of the negotiations , it was found necessary to discuss and to reach a mutual understanding as to the interpretation to be placed upon certain draft provisions eventually incorporated in the signed treaty. These discussions and understandings were , after each meeting, embodied in the duly attested typewritten record of the proceedings of the treaty negotiations.
It seems possible that, following the favorable report at the close of the last session of Congress by the Committee on Foreign Relations of the United States Senate on the General Treaty and accompanying Conventions, the individual members of the Senate in their considera-

tion during the current session of Congress of the Treaty and Conventions, may ask for clarification as to the precise meaning of certain

important provisions of the General Treaty which affect the security and neutrality of the Panama Canal. With a view to anticipating these inquiries, and in the hope of avoiding further delay on this account in the consideration of the General Treaty of March 2 , 1936 , it has seemed to my Government advisable to set forth in an exchange of notes between our two Governments the substance of some of these

above-mentioned understandings as mutually reached . I should be grateful , accordingly, if you would inform me whether your Government shares the understanding of my Government upon the points which follow in subsequent paragraphs.

1. In connection with the declared willingness of both the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the

Republic of Panama to cooperate for the purpose of insuring the full and perpetual enjoyment of the benefits of all kinds which the Canal

should afford them (Article I of the General Treaty of March 2 , 1936 ) the word "maintenance" as applied to the Canal shall be construed as permitting expansion and new construction when these are undertaken

by the Government of the United States of America in accordance with the said Treaty.

2. The holding of maneuvers or exercises by the armed forces of the United States of America in territory adjacent to the Canal Zone is an essential measure of preparedness for the protection of the neutrality of the Panama Canal, and when said maneuvers or exercises should take place , the parties shall follow the procedure set forth in the records of the proceedings of the negotiations of the General Treaty of March 2 , 1936 , which proceedings were held on March 2 , 1936 .

Con el objeto de anticiparse a esa eventualidad y evitar nuevas demoras a la consideración del Tratado General de Marzo 2 de 1936 , manifiesta Vuestra Excelencia que le parece con-

With a view to anticipating such an eventuality, and of avoiding new delays in the consideration of the General Treaty of March 2 , 1936 , Your Excellency states that it seems advisable to your Government to effect an exchange of notes with my Government for the purpose of reiterating the interpretation given to certain points in the proceedings.
I take pleasure in informing Your Excellency that I have been authorized by my Government to effect this exchange of notes and to clarify the points propounded by Your Excellency, and which, for greater clarity, are set forth in the English language as follows :
1. In connection with the declared willingness of both the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of Panama to cooperate for the purpose of insuring the full and perpetual enjoyment of the benefits of all kinds which the Canal should afford them (Article I of the General Treaty of March 2 , 1936 ) the word "maintenance" as applied to the Canal shall be construed as permitting expansion and new construction when these are undertaken by the Government of the United States of America in accordance with the said Treaty.

ARTICLE 15.

Indemnity.
1. On the basis of the provisions of Article XVII of the Agreement, the sender is entitled to an indemnity corresponding to the actual amount of the loss of an insured parcel and of the abstraction of or damage to its contents.
Indemnity is paid to the addressee when he claims it, either after making reservations when accepting delivery of a pilfered or damaged parcel, or if he proves that the sender has waived his rights in his favour.
When an insured parcel is redirected or returned to a third country from one of the two countries, the sender, in case of loss , rifling, or damage occurring subsequent to the redirection or return of the parcel, can lay claim only to the indemnity which the Administration of the country where the loss, rifling, or damage occurred consents to pay, or which that Administration is obligated to pay in accordance with the agreement made between the Administrations of the countries directly interested in the redirection or return.
2. The amount of indemnity is calculated on the basis of the actual value (current price or, in the absence of current price, the ordinary estimated value) at the time and place of mailing of the parcel, provided in any case that the indemnity shall not exceed the amount
for which the parcel was insured. Indirect loss or loss of profits is not taken into consideration. In the case where indemnity is payable for the loss of a parcel or
for the destruction or abstraction of the whole of the contents thereof, the sender is entitled to return of the postal charges which have been paid. However, the insurance fees are not returned in any case.

4. The payment of indemnity shall be made as soon as possible and at the latest within a period of one year counting from the day following that on which the application is made.
However, the paying Administration may exceptionally defer payment of indemnity for a longer period than that stipulated if, at the expiration of that period, it has not been able to determine the disposition made of the parcel in question or the responsibility incurred .

6. Responsibility for loss, abstraction , or damage of a parcel discovered by the receiving office of exchange at the time of opening the receptacles and duly notified to the dispatching office of exchange by bulletin of verification, shall fall upon the Administration to which the dispatching office of exchange is subordinate unless it be proved that the damage occurred in the service of the receiving Administration.
7. Until the contrary is proved, responsibility for a parcel rests with the Administration which, having received the parcel without making any observation and being furnished with all necessary particulars for inquiry, is unable to show its proper disposition.
8. If the loss, abstraction, or damage has occurred in course of conveyance without its being possible to ascertain in which service the irregularity took place, the Administrations concerned bear the loss in equal shares.
9. The Administration responsible or on whose account payment is made in accordance with Section 5 is bound to repay to the Administration making payment on its behalf, without delay and within not more than nine months after receiving notice of payment, the amount of indemnity paid.

forwarding or return of the parcel by the original country of destination, can lay claim, in such a case, only to the indemnity which the country where the loss, rifling, or damage occurred consents to pay, or which that country is obliged to pay in accordance with the agreement made between the countries directly interested in the

regulations, cannot establish either proper delivery to the addressee or his agent, or other proper disposal of the parcel.

2. When the loss, rifling, or damage of an insured parcel is detected upon opening the receptacle at the receiving exchange office and has been regularly pointed out to the dispatching exchange office, the responsibility falls on the Administration to which the

3. If, in the case of a parcel dispatched from one of the two countries for delivery in the other, the loss, damage, or abstraction has occurred in course of conveyance without it being possible to prove

in the service of which country the irregularity took place, the two Administrations shall bear the amount of compensation in equal shares.

DETAILED REGULATIONS FOR THE EXECUTION OF THE PARCEL POST AGREEMENT

The following Detailed Regulations for the Execution of the Parcel Post Agreement have been agreed upon by the Chiefs of the Postal Administrations of the United States of America and Iceland. They may be changed from time to time as may be deemed necessary :
ARTICLE 1 .

Limits of weight and size.
The parcels to be exchanged under the provisions of this Agreement may not exceed 44 pounds (20 kilograms ) in weight nor the following dimensions :

Limits of weight and size.

meters) long do not exceed 24 inches ( 61 centimeters ) in girth ; that parcels over 44 inches (112 centimeters ) but not over 46 inches ( 117)

centimeters) long do not exceed 20 inches ( 51 centimeters) in girth ; that parcels over 46 inches ( 117 centimeters ) but not over 48 inches (122 centimeters ) long do not exceed 16 inches (41 centimeters ) in

spondence .

ARTICLE 2 .

Preparation of parcels.

be legibly and correctly written in every case, on the parcel itself when possible, or on a label or tag firmly attached thereto. It is not allowed to write with initials the name and address of the sender

Preparation of parcels.

or addressee, unless the initials are the adopted trade name of the sender or addressee which is generally understood . Addresses in pencil are also not allowed, except those written with indelible pencil on a previously dampened surface.

A slip bearing the name and address of the sender and addressee must be enclosed in the parcel when the address is written on a label or tag which is not gummed to the parcel. It is advisable that such slips be enclosed in all parcels.

2. Every parcel must be packed in a manner adequate for the length of the journey and the character of the contents, and in such a way as to prevent the contents from damaging other parcels or objects or injuring the postal agents. The packing must protect the contents sufficiently that, in case of rifling, the traces thereof may be easily discovered .

No packing is required for ordinary parcels consisting of a single

article, such as pieces of wood , metal , etc. , which are not usually packed by the trade.

Any liquid or any substance which easily liquefies must be packed in a double receptacle. Between the inner receptacle (bottle, flask, pot, box, etc. ) and the outer (box of metal, of strong wood, of strong

corrugated cardboard, strong fiberboard, or receptacle of equal

strength) shall be left a space which shall be filled with sawdust, bran, or some other absorbent material, in sufficient quantity to absorb all the liquid contents in the case of breakage.
Powders and dyes in powder form must be packed in lead-sealed metal containers which must be enclosed in substantial outer covers ,
so as to obviate all damage to the accompanying mail matter. 3. Insured parcels must be sealed by means of wax, by lead, or
other seals. Ordinary parcels may be sealed at the option of the sender, or careful tying is sufficient as a mode of closing. Either Administration may require a special design or mark of the sender in the sealing of insured parcels mailed in its service, as a means of protection.
The Customs of the country of destination, for the purpose of customs examination, shall have the right to break the seals. After customs examination is concluded , the parcels shall be officially resealed .
4. On the address side, each insured parcel must bear a label with the words "Insured" or "Valeur déclarée", or be stamped or marked with the same words in close proximity to the number given the parcel, and it must also bear an indication of the amount of the insured value mentioned fully and legibly in the currency of the country of origin and in roman letters. This amount must be con-
verted into gold francs by the sender or by the office of origin and the result of conversion is added below the original description . The amount of the insured value must also be indicated on the customs declaration .
5. The seals, as well as any kind of labels or stamps, affixed to insured parcels must be so placed as not to hide injuries to the package. Moreover, the labels or stamps must not be folded over two sides of the package so as to cover the edge.

to the delivery of such parcel to another person at the original place of destination. These charges shall not be cancelled even in case the

parcel is returned to origin or is reforwarded to another country.

2. Each parcel must be packed in such a manner that the contents are protected over the whole route, and in such a way as to prevent the contents from damaging other parcels or objects or injuring postal agents. The packing must protect the contents sufficiently that, in case of rifling, the traces thereof may be easily discovered.
Parcels may be sealed at the option of the sender, or careful tying is sufficient as a mode of closing.
The Customs Administration of the country of destination is authorized to open the parcels in order to inspect the contents. To that end, the seals or any other fastenings may be broken. Parcels opened by the Customs must be refastened and also officially resealed, except in the case of parcels which were not sealed by the senders in the first instance .

of mailing, gross and net weight, the sender's name and address, and the name and address of the addressee, and shall be securely attached to the parcel.
However, as an exception to the foregoing, when more than one parcel is mailed simultaneously by the same sender in the United States of America to the same addressee at the same address in the Colony of Fiji , or vice versa, the sender need prepare only one customs declaration for the entire shipment, which customs declaration shall show, in addition to the particulars set forth in the preceding paragraph, the total number of parcels comprising the shipment, and shall be securely attached to one of the parcels. The parcels comprising the entire shipment shall be clearly marked in such case with a fractional number, the numerator of which will indicate, in Arabic figures, the number of the parcel and denominator the number of parcels comprising the shipment ; for example, if a single shipment were composed of 15 parcels, each parcel would be numbered , respectively, 15, 15 , 15, &c.

Arrangement between the United States of America and Canada regarding radio broadcasting. Effected by exchange of notes , signed October 28 and December 10, 1938.

The Secretary of State (Hull) to the Canadian Minister (Marler) DEPARTMENT OF STATE,

Arrangement with Canada regarding radio broadcasting.

SIR :

Washington, October 28, 1938.

I have the honor to inform you of the Department's consideration of three arrangements resulting from the deliberations of the Inter-

American Radio Conference which was held at Habana, Cuba from

November 1 to December 13, 1937. Those Agreements relate to the

following subjects:

a. Arrangement regarding radio broadcasting channels which provides for a tentative allocation of broadcasting frequencies established in view of the terms of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement, Habana 1937 .
b. Agreement between the United States and Canada for the use of the frequency 540 kilocycles.
c. Agreement with respect to the assignment by the United States of a Class I-A station to the 700 kilocycle frequency with a power of 50 kilowatts or more and the assignment by Canada of a similar station with equal power on a frequency of 690 kilocycles.

For your convenience there are quoted the proposed arrangements outlined above:

a. ARRANGEMENT REGARDING RADIO BROADCASTING CHANNELS

There shall be in Canada sixteen full time station assignments to

stations which at present are considered as regional or local stations , and under the proposed North American Broadcasting Agreement ,

signed at Habana, December 13 , 1937 , will be classified at Class III or Class IV. Six of these stations shall have a power of 1,000 watts

each and ten a power of 100 watts each, as follows ;

CANADA- RADIO BROADCASTING- Oct. 28, 1938 Dec. 10, 1938

In the case of Station CHML which remains on a regional channel, the Government of the United States agrees to protect this station from interference to the same extent as it is protected from other Canadian stations but in no event to a greater extent than that provided for Class IV stations on local channels .

These assignments are hereby reserved pending ratification of and placing in operation of the proposed North American Regional Broadcast Agreement. Pending such events, the Governments of Canada and the United States agree that in making any changes in existing

station assignments as of the date of this exchange of notes , or authorizing new assignments after that date, the assignments set out above

will be afforded protection in accordance with the allocation standards as provided in the proposed Agreement.
In addition to these sixteen stations , there are thirteen stations now

operating in Canada with power of 100 watts on channels that are now classified as regional channels and which under the terms of the proposed Agreement will be regional channels for assignment of Class III stations with a minimum power of 500 watts . Part II C 5 (b) of the proposed Agreement provides that Class IV stations may operate on regional channels, but, when so operated , they are subject to such interference as may be received from Class III stations which are not

required to protect the Class IV stations on the same regional channel. The Parties to this exchange of notes recognize that, if possible , these stations should be reassigned to local channels in order that they may be afforded protection from interference from other stations in accordance with the allocation standards for Class IV stations . The

assignments for these stations are provided accordingly as follows:

Three of these stations (CFCO, CKPC, and CHGS) remain on regional channels and in accordance with the provisions above mentioned are not afforded protection from interference from the Class III stations on the channel. However, the Government of the United States agrees to protect these stations from interference to the same extent that they are protected from other Canadian stations but in no event to a greater extent than that provided for Class IV stations on local channels.
b. Recognizing the desirability of preserving the principle of their existing understanding as to the use of the frequency of 540 kilocycles for broadcasting by Canada and recognizing the desirability of affording, as far as reasonably can be done, protection to important aeronautical and maritime mobile services of the United States using frequencies in the non-public service band of 515 to 550 kilocycles from broadcast interference , the undersigned have agreed as follows:
1. The frequency 540 kilocycles may be used by Canada for broadcasting purposes at a Canadian station which shall be located in the Province of Saskatchewan and operated so as not to produce a ground wave signal intensity in excess of 500 microvolts per meter on the Canadian-United States border west of longitude 105° W.

2043

2044

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [53 STAT.
2. The United States of America may require that a directional antenna be installed at the station and that, if and when advice to that effect is given, Canada will install such directional antenna within one year from the date of receipt by Canada of such advice . The direction of maximum suppression of the antenna should be as near as possible in the direction of San Francisco, subject to allowing for a ground wave signal of 500 microvolts per meter intensity at any point along the boundary between Saskatchewan and the United States.
3. When, as and if a substitute broadcasting channel acceptable to the Canadian Government is made available for this station Canada agrees to discontinue the use of 540 kilocycles for broadcasting purposes .
4. This Agreement shall become effective from the date on which the North American Regional Agreement, signed at Habana on the 13th day of December, 1937 , becomes effective . It shall remain in effect until the expiration, on the part of the United States and Canada , of the said North American Regional Agreement.
5. The undersigned will recommend to their respective governments that consideration be given to the cancellation, on the date on which this Agreement becomes effective , of all prior agreements insofar as they have reference to the use of 540 kilocycles by Canada for broadcasting .
c. The Government of the United States of America agrees that if it should assign a Class I-A station to the channel 700 kilocycles with power greater than 50 kilowatts, it will take, or cause to be taken, such measures as are necessary to prevent the field intensity delivered by such station at night from exceeding a value five times as great as that which would be delivered by an efficient 50 kilowatt transmitter located at or near Montreal, Canada, on 690 kilocycles at a point near Rochester, New York. For this purpose the field intensities of the United States station shall be based on the 10 % skywave and the Canadian station on the 50 % skywave, during the second hour after sunset. If the field intensity delivered by the Canadian station should exceed that which would be delivered by an efficient 50 kilowatt transmitter then the actual field strength shall be taken as the basis for said ratio. In no event, however, shall the Class I-A station in the United States be required to deliver a field strength at said point less than that which would be delivered by an efficient 50 kilowatt transmitter located at or near Cincinnati, Ohio.
I accordingly have the honor to inquire whether the three Agreements outlined in this communication have the approval of your Government and whether, in the event of that approval, it is agree-
able to the publication immediately of this note and such favorable reply as you may find it possible to make, it being understood that none of these Agreements shall become effective until the effective
date of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement. Accept, Sir, the renewed assurance of my highest consideration . CORDELL HULL

LEGATION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

Provisional commercial agreement with Greece.

EXCELLENCY:

Athens, November 15, 1938.

I have the honor to make the following statement of my understanding of the agreement reached through recent conversations held

at Athens by representatives of the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Kingdom of Greece with reference to the treatment which the United States of America shall accord

to the commerce of the Kingdom of Greece and which the Kingdom of Greece shall accord to the commerce of the United States of America.

These conversations have disclosed a mutual understanding between the two Governments which is that the United States of America will

accord to the commerce of the Kingdom of Greece and the Kingdom of Greece will accord to the commerce of the United States of America,

its territories and possessions , non-discriminatory treatment.

Accordingly the two Governments have agreed upon the following

provisions : I

Most-favored-nation treatment.

With respect to customs duties or charges of any kind imposed on

or in connection with importation or exportation, and with respect to

the method of levying such duties or charges, and with respect to all rules and formalities in connection with importation or exportation,

and with respect to all laws or regulations affecting the sale, taxation

or use of imported goods within the country, any advantage, favor,

privilege or immunity which has been or may hereafter be granted by

the United States of America or the Kingdom of Greece to any article

originating in or destined for any third country, shall be accorded

immediately and unconditionally to the like article originating in or

destined for the Kingdom of Greece or the United States of America,

respectively. II

Regulation, limita- 1. Neither the Government of the United States of America nor the tion, or control of

imports.

Royal Hellenic Government shall regulate by import licenses or permits

the importation into its territory of any article in which the other

country has an interest , or by any method maintain limitation or con-

trol of the amount of importation of any such article, unless similar

action is taken with respect to the importation of such article from all other countries.
2. If imports of such an article from the other country are, directly or indirectly, restricted by such regulation, limitation , or control, the Government taking such action shall establish in advance, and inform the other Government of, the total amount permitted to be imported from all countries during any specified period , which shall not be shorter than three months , and of any increase in such amount during the specified period , and shall either-
(a) Impose no limitation on the part of such total amount which may be imported from the other country; or
(b) Establish in advance, and inform the other country concerning, the quota of such article which shall be permitted to be imported from the other country during the specified period . Such quota, as originally established or subsequently changed, shall be equivalent to the proportion of the total importation of such article which the other country supplied during past years, account being taken in so far as practicable in appropriate cases of any special factors which may have affected or may be affecting the trade in that article . Where a quota for importation from the other country is established , no obstacle, administrative or otherwise, shall be placed in the way of importation sufficient to fill the quota allotted to the other country. If the total amount permitted entry from all countries is increased during any quota period, the quota established for the other country shall be increased proportionately.
3. If the Government of either country establishes or maintains such regulation, limitation , or control of the importation of an article in which the other country has an interest, it shall-
(a) Make public the regulations regarding the issuance of licenses or permits, or regarding any other method of limitation or control, before such regulations are put into force ;
(b) Administer any system of licenses or permits or any other method of limitation or control so as not to discriminate against importation from the other country, and in no manner, directly or indirectly, influence importers regarding the country from which they shall seek permission to import any such article ;
(c) Ensure that there shall be no undue delay in the issuance of licenses or permits ;
(d) Ensure that any duly qualified importer seeking to establish new, or to reestablish old, trade connections with the other country, or to maintain such trade connections , shall be given reasonable opportunity to import any such article ; and upon request inform any such duly qualified importer whose application is rejected of the reasons for such rejection ;
(e) At all times upon request advise the Government of the other country of the amount of any such article, the growth, produce, or manufacture of each exporting country which has been imported, or for which licenses or permits for importation have been granted. 4. The provisions of this Article shall also be applicable with respect to any regulation, limitation , or control imposed by either Government upon the importation of such article at a particular rate of duty or charge.

Agreement by Greece. No. 27039/G/1/1 MR. MINISTER:

ATHENS , November 15, 1938.

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your Note of November 15, 1938 , reading as follows :

"I have the honor to make the following statement of my understanding of the agreement reached through recent conversations held at Athens by representatives of the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Kingdom of Greece with reference to the treatment which the United States of America shall accord to the commerce of the Kingdom of Greece and which the Kingdom of Greece shall accord to the commerce of the United States of America.

"These conversations have disclosed a mutual understanding between the two Governments which is that the United States of

America will accord to the commerce of the Kingdom of Greece and the Kingdom of Greece will accord to the commerce of the United States of America, its territories and possessions, non-discriminatory treatment.

"Accordingly the two Governments have agreed upon the following provisions:
I

"With respect to customs duties or charges of any kind imposed on or in connection with importation or exportation, and with respect to the method of levying such duties or charges, and with respect to all rules and formalities in connection with importation or exportation, and with respect to all laws or regulations affecting the sale, taxation or use of imported goods within the country, any advantage, favor, privilege or immunity which has been or may hereafter be granted by the United States of America or the Kingdom of Greece to any article originating in or destined for any third country, shall be accorded immediately and unconditionally to the like article originating in or destined for the Kingdom of Greece or the United States of America, respectively.
II
"1. Neither the Government of the United States of America nor the Royal Hellenic Government shall regulate by import licenses or permits the importation into its territory of any article in which the other country has an interest, or by any method maintain limitation or control of the amount of importation of any such article, unless similar action is taken with respect to the importation of such article from all other countries.

53 STAT. ] GREECE- COMMERCIAL RELATIONS- NOV. 15, 1938
"2. If imports of such an article from the other country are, directly or indirectly, restricted by such regulation , limitation, or control, the Government taking such action shall establish in advance, and inform the other Government of, the total amount permitted to
be imported from all countries during any specified period , which shall not be shorter than three months, and of any increase in such amount during the specified period , and shall either-
(a) Impose no limitation on the part of such total amount which may be imported from the other country ; or
(b ) Establish in advance, and inform the other country concerning, the quota of such article which shall be permitted to be imported from the other country during the specified period . Such quota, as originally established or subsequently changed, shall be equivalent to the proportion of the total importation of such article which the other country supplied during past years, account being taken in so far as practicable in appropriate cases of any special factors which may have affected or may be affecting the trade in that article . Where a quota for importation from the other country is established, no obstacle, administrative or otherwise, shall be placed in the way of importation sufficient to fill the quota allotted to the other country. If the total amount permitted entry from all countries is increased during any quota period, the quota established for the other country shall be increased proportionately.
"3. If the Government of either country establishes or maintains such regulation, limitation, or control of the importation of an article in which the other country has an interest, it shall-
(a) Make public the regulations regarding the issuance of licenses or permits, or regarding any other method of limitation or control, before such regulations are put into force;
(b) Administer any system of licenses or permits or any other method of limitation or control so as not to discriminate against importation from the other country, and in no manner, directly or indirectly, influence importers regarding the country from which they shall seek permission to import any such article ;
(c) Ensure that there shall be no undue delay in the issuance of licenses or permits ;
(d) Ensure that any duly qualified importer seeking to establish new, or to reestablish old, trade connections with the other country, or to maintain such trade connections, shall be given reasonable opportunity to import any such article ; and upon request inform any such duly qualified importer whose application is rejected of the reasons for such rejection ;
(e) At all times upon request advise the Government of the other country of the amount of any such article, the growth, produce, or manufacture of each exporting country which has been imported, or for which licenses or permits for importation have been granted.
"4. The provisions of this Article shall also be applicable with respect to any regulation, limitation, or control imposed by either
Government upon the importation of such article at a particular rate of duty or charge.

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [53 STAT.
III
"In the event that the Government of the United States of America or the Royal Hellenic Government establishes or maintains , directly or indirectly, any form of control of the means of international payment, it shall, in the administration of such control :
(a) Impose no prohibition, restriction, condition, or delay on the transfer of payment for imported articles the growth, produce, or manufacture of the other country, or of payments necessary for and incidental to the importation of such articles ;
(b) Accord unconditionally, with respect to rates of exchange and taxes or surcharges on exchange transactions in connection with payments for or payments necessary and incidental to the importation of all articles the growth, produce, or manufacture of the other country, treatment no less favorable than that accorded in connection with the importation of any article whatsoever the growth, produce, or manufacture of any third country ; and
(c) Accord unconditionally, with respect to all rules and formalities applying to exchange transactions in connection with payments for or payments necessary and incidental to the importation of articles the growth, produce, or manufacture of the other country, treatment no less favorable than that accorded in connection with the importation of the like articles the growth, produce, or manufacture of any third country.
IV
"1. In the event that the Government of the United States of America or the Royal Hellenic Government establishes or maintains a monopoly for the importation, production, or sale of a particular commodity or grants exclusive privileges, formally or in effect, to one or more agencies to import, produce, or sell a particular commodity, the Government of the country establishing or maintaining such monopoly, or granting such monopoly privileges, agrees that in respect of the foreign purchases of such monopoly or agency the commerce of the other country shall receive fair and equitable treatment. To this end it is agreed that in making its foreign purchases of any product such monopoly or agency will be influenced solely by those considerations, such as price, quality , marketability, and terms of sale, which would ordinarily be taken into account by a private commercial enterprise interested solely in purchasing such product on the most favorable terms.
"2. It is agreed that the Government of each country, in the awarding of contracts for public works and generally in the purchase of supplies , shall not discriminate against the other country in favor of any third country.
V
"1. The advantages now accorded or which may hereafter be accorded by the United States of America or the Kingdom of Greece to adjacent countries in order to facilitate frontier traffic, and advan-

53 STAT. ] GREECE- COMMERCIAL RELATIONS- NOV. 15, 1938
tages resulting from a customs union to which either the United States of America or the Kingdom of Greece may become a party, shall be excepted from the operation of this Agreement.
"2. The advantages now accorded or which may hereafter be accorded by the United States of America , its territories or possessions, the Philippine Islands, or the Panama Canal Zone to one another or to the Republic of Cuba shall be excepted from the operation of this Agreement .
"3. Subject to the requirement that, under like circumstances and conditions , there shall be no arbitrary discrimination by either country against the other country in favor of any third country, the provisions of this Agreement shall not extend to prohibitions or restrictions (1 ) imposed on moral or humanitarian grounds ; (2) designed to protect human, animal or plant life or health ; (3 ) relating to prison-made goods ; (4) relating to the enforcement of police or revenue laws.
"4. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent the adoption of measures prohibiting or restricting the importation or exportation of gold or silver, or to prevent the adoption of such measures as either Government may see fit with respect to the control of the export or sale for export of arms, ammunition , or implements of war, and , in exceptional circumstances, all other military supplies, and it is agreed, further, that nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent the adoption or enforcement of measures relating to neutrality.
VI
"The present Agreement shall replace the exchange of notes between the Government of the United States and the Government of the Kingdom of Greece of December 9, 1924 , ¹ and shall become operative on the first day of January, 1939, and shall continue in force until superseded by a more comprehensive commercial agreement or by a definitive treaty of commerce and navigation, or until denounced by either country by advance written notice of not less than thirty days."
In informing you that the Greek Government is in agreement with the contents of the above Note , I beg you to accept, Mr. Minister, the assurances of my highest consideration.

Agreement with Canada respecting radio communications between Alaska and
British Columbia.

SIR :

June 9, 1938.

I have the honor to inform you of the desire of the Polaris-Taku Mining Company, Limited, to establish radio communication between

its privately owned radio station in the Province of British Colum-

bia, Canada, and the station of the Alaska Communication System

at Juneau, Alaska, for the exchange of traffic pertaining to weather

and flying conditions and emergency medical assistance. In view

of the nature of the messages sought to be exchanged the War De-

partment of the United States approves the establishment of the

proposed circuit.

I accordingly inquire whether the Government of Canada is prepared to authorize the suggested radio connection , omitting ordinary commercial traffic , between stations of the Alaska Communication System and radio stations located in Canada. If such approval is given by your Government it is suggested that provision be made for the modification of the details of arrangements

with respect to the class of traffic handled, subject to the approval of the Secretary of War of the United States and a designated official of the Government of Canada.
It is also proposed that the arrangement provide for the operation and administration of the affected radio channels subject to the following conditions which are understood to be in accordance with the procedure and practice applicable to similar channels now in operation :

a. Radio traffic will be exchanged in accordance with the regular operating procedure of the Alaska Communication System and of the radio stations in the Dominion of Canada, provided that in cases where theoperating procedure applicable to one station is in conflict with the operating procedure of the station with which radio traffic is exchanged, the differences will be administratively adjusted by cooperation between the chief operators of the stations involved.
b. The establishment of operating schedules between any two stations authorized to exchange radio traffic will be such as may be agreed upon between the Officer in Charge, Alaska Communication System, Seattle, Washington, and the administrative official in charge of the operation of the radio station with which such radio schedules are established.

53 STAT. ] CANADA-RADIO COMMUNICATIONS- June 9, July 11 and 18, Aug. 22, Sept. 27, Oct. 4, Nov. 16, Dec. 20, 1938

c. The charges made by the Alaska Communication System on local traffic between the local radio station of the Alaska
Communication System and any radio station in the Dominion of Canada with which arrangements are made for the exchange
of traffic will be in accordance with duly established tariffs applicable to such service.
d. The division of tolls between the participating radio stations will be made on the basis of the tolls accruing to each in accordance with applicable tariffs, and settlement of accounts will be made by the Auditor for the Alaska Communication System, Seattle, Washington, at such intervals as may be agreed upon and in the same manner as settlement is made under similar conditions for commercial radio traffic between stations of the Alaska Communication System and other radio stations.
e. Arrangements for the exchange of radio traffic between stations of the Alaska Communication System and radio stations located in the Dominion of Canada shall not be extended to provide for the forwarding of drafts or money orders.

It should be observed that it is not intended that this proposed

arrangement shall in any way contravene the provisions of the United

States Canadian regional arrangement governing the use of radio

for aeronautical services, which was negotiated at a conference in

Washington in January 1938 and which is now before your Gov-

ernment for study.

It is suggested that the contemplated service be authorized to com-

mence at any time after the conclusion of this understanding by

exchange of notes and that either party may withdraw from the

arrangement by giving six months' notice in writing to the other

party, at which time the arrangement shall be deemed to have termi-

nated. In this connection, however, it should be borne in mind that

the terms of this arrangement shall be within the scope of the exist-

ing international telecommunication convention and the annexed

regulations to which both parties hereto may have adhered.

Accept, Sir, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration.

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [ 53 STAT.

I am now instructed to call to your attention that the Department of Transport state that while the Polaris-Taku Mining Company have clearly specified the classes of message they desire to exchange between their station at Tulsequah , British Columbia, and the Juneau station of the Alaska Communications System, representations re-
ceived by the Department from the legal agents of the Company state that messages following the normal routing of commercial traffic between these stations are subject to serious delay and they now request authority to handle any class of local message between Tulsequah and Juneau direct.
In view of this request the Department of Transport approached the Government Telegraph Service of the Department of Public Works with a view to eliminating the difficulties experienced in the service between Tulsequah and Juneau, and the following proposals have now been submitted in this connection by the Government Telegraph Service. These proposals- it is understood-have been approved by the legal agents of the Polaris-Taku Mining Company at Vancouver.

(1 ) All commercial traffic between Juneau and Tulsequah should be routed in future via Atlin instead of via Telegraph Creek, Wrangell, Seattle and Juneau, which is the present route for such traffic. The Canadian Government station at Atlin is
much more powerful than the Telegraph Creek station and it is considered to be better located to work with Juneau and Tul-
sequah than is Telegraph Creek. It is proposed that this Tulsequah-Atlin-Juneau schedule should be worked every two hours during the day.
It is understood that it would be necessary to obtain permis-
sion from the Chief Signal Officer, United States Army, to establish this proposed communication between the station of the Alaska Communications System at Juneau and the station of the Government Telegraph Service at Atlin in order to handle Tulsequah business with Juneau.
(2) The Government Telegraph Service state that they are prepared in connection with the Sunday and holiday service to accede to the wishes of the Polaris-Taku Mining Company that the Tulsequah station should communicate direct with Juneau
as is the present practice in the handling of weather reports and emergency medical assistance.

The Department of Transport state that they have no objection to the extension of this service between Tulsequah and Juneau on the

basis of the proposals of the Government Telegraph Service as outlined above.
I should be glad to be informed whether this proposed arrangement would meet with the approval of the interested authorities of the United States Government.

I have the honour to be with the highest consideration Sir Your most obedient humble servant

SIR :

October 4, 1938.

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of a note from your Legation, No. 232 of September 27, 1938 in regard to the amplification of the former agreement concerning the transmission of meteorological and other emergency radio messages between the station of the Polaris-Taku Mining Company, Limited, and the station of the Alaska Communications System at Juneau.
It is understood that the proposed amplification comprehends the following :

1. That all commercial traffic between Juneau and Tulsequah, the station of the Polaris-Taku Mining Company, shall be routed in the future via Atlin instead of via Telegraph Creek, Wrangell, Seattle , and Juneau, the present route for such traffic.
2. In connection with Sunday and holiday service, direct communication between the Tulsequah station and Juneau following the present practice in the handling of weather reports and messages regarding emergency medical assistance.

The suggestion in the note under acknowledgment is being brought to the attention of the appropriate authorities of this Government for their consideration and such comments as they may find it desirable to submit. I shall communicate with you further as soon as a statement of their views has been received.
Accept, Sir, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration . For the Secretary of State : G. S. MESSERSMITH

I have the honor to refer to your Legation's note No. 232 of September 27, 1938, and my reply of October 4, 1938, outlining an amplification of the arrangement for the transmission of meteorological and other emergency radio messages between the station of the

Polaris-Taku Mining Company, Limited, and the station of the Alaska Communication System at Juneau.

Upon the recommendation of the appropriate authorities of this Government I have the honor to inform you of its acceptance of the

suggestions contained in your note of September 27, 1938.

2098

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [53 STAT.
It has been further suggested that the arrangement provide for the direct handling of commercial traffic between Tulsequah and Juneau at all times when the radio station at Atlin is closed or otherwise inoperative so as to permit the handling of urgent commercial traffic when the Atlin station is closed at the end of the business day as well as on Sundays and holidays.
It has also been recommended that this circuit be made available for the handling of other radio traffic between the Alaska Communication System and radio stations under the control of the Government Telegraph Service of the Canadian Department of Public Works in accordance with practices applicable to the exchange of traffic between stations of the Alaska Communication System at Fairbanks, Wrangell, and Ketchikan and stations of the Canadian Government at Dawson, Telegraph Creek, and Digby Island , respectively.
I shall be glad to be informed of the views of your Government with respect to these additional recommendations in order that, if it concurs in them, they may be made effective by this exchange of notes.
Accept, Sir, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration. For the Secretary of State : G. S. MESSERSMITH

CANADIAN LEGATION WASHINGTON
December 20th, 1938.

I have the honour to refer to your note of November 16th outlining certain additional recommendations with regard to the proposed amplification of the arrangement for the transmission of meteorological and other emergency radio messages between the station of the Polaris-Taku Mining Company Limited and the station of the Alaska Communications System at Juneau.
I have now the honour to inform you that the Canadian Government, after consultation with the appropriate authorities have decided upon the acceptance of the recommendations outlined in your note of November 16.

The Polaris-Taku Mining Company Limited have now therefore been informed that the Department of Transport have no objection to the suggested arrangement to provide for the direct handling of commercial traffic between Tulsequah and Juneau at all times when the radio station at Atlin is closed or otherwise inoperative so as to

53 STAT.] CANADA- RADIO COMMUNICATIONS- June 9 , July 11 and 18, Aug. 22, Sept. 27, Oct. 4, Nov. 16, Dec. 20, 1938
permit the handling of urgent commercial traffic when the Atlin station is closed at the end of the business day as well as on Sundays and holidays.
With regard to the further suggestion of your government that the Atlin-Juneau channel should be used as a transfer medium for traffic between the Alaska Communications System and the stations in Northern British Columbia and the Yukon Territory operated by the Department of Transport , it is agreed that the proposed direct transfer at Juneau would be more satisfactory than the present arrangement over the White Pass and Yukon land lines, and the Government Telegraph Service, Department of Public Works, have been requested to proceed to make suitable arrangements with officials of the Alaska Communications System for putting this recommendation into practice.

Government of Canada for the conclusion of a United States- nautical services.

Canadian Regional Arrangement Governing the Use of Radio for Civil Aeronautical Services .

It is my understanding that it has been agreed in the course of the negotiations, now terminated , that the Arrangement shall be as follows :

UNITED STATES-CANADIAN REGIONAL ARRANGEMENT GOVERNING THE USE OF RADIO FOR CIVIL AERONAUTICAL SERVICES

Article I. Scope: The present arrangement between the United States and Canada concerns primarily the radio communication service of civil aeronautics and civil air navigation services . Except for Article XIII , the subject matter of this arrangement is confined to the frequencies 200-400 kc . and above 30,000 kc . Services other than civil aeronautical which may incidentally be involved from the standpoint of interference to and by the civil aeronautical radio services are treated in Article XVII . Nothing in this arrangement shall be construed as lessening in any manner or to any degree the rights enjoyed by the national defense services of either country.
Article II. Application : Nothing in the present arrangement shall contravene the pertinent portions of the International Telecommunication Convention, Madrid , 1932 ; the radio regulations annexed thereto to which the parties to this arrangement have subscribed ; the InterAmerican Radio Communications Convention , Habana, 1937 , and the Inter-American Arrangement on Radio Communications , Habana, 1937 , or such documents as may supplant them as a result of subsequent conferences .
Article III. Standardization : In order that international flying may be facilitated, the standardization and use of aeronautical radio facilities are provided for in this arrangement. Appendix I lists the standard classes of aeronautical radio aids approved for service operation.

of the available channels, assignments shall be duplicated with a

minimum practicable geographical separation between stations as

determined by permissible ratio of interfering signal to desired signal, characteristics of the frequencies in use, and the areas of operation of

the stations concerned .
Sharing of channels. Article V. Sharing of Channels: The principle of the sharing of

frequencies which are made available for aeronautical services by

international convention is fully recognized , particularly, however,

with respect to those allocated to such services by the Inter-American

Arrangement Concerning Radio Communications, Habana, 1937.

Recognition is given , however, to the priority of existing services as set forth in Article XVII and Appendix IV. In general, assignments

to a new station shall be treated as an individual problem to be solved

the service area may be reduced to a minimum, radiated power should

ordinarily be adjusted to a value consistent with a normal required

field intensity within the prescribed area in which it is desired to render service.

Article IX. Identification Signals: The identification signal em-
ployed to identify individual radio range stations shall consist of two
letters and shall be assigned without duplication. Where practicable,

the signal used to establish the identity of radio facilities at any particular point should correspond to the designator for weather reports from the same station.

Spacing and assignment of channels.

quencies for aviation purposes is still on an experimental basis . The Parties accordingly agree to cooperate in the development of

the use of this ultra high frequency band so that frequencies of the same order may be used for similar purposes throughout the United States and Canada and that the table shown in Appendix III shall

ments to airport control stations on this frequency will be made unless there is installed for simultaneous use facilities for operation on fre-

quencies between 129 and 132 megacycles . It is further proposed that the use of 278 kc. for airport control purposes may be discon-

tinued after January 1 , 1940 and replaced by frequencies between

No. 38

CANADIAN LEGATION WASHINGTON

February 20, 1939 SIR :
Agreement by I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your note of Canada.
February 20th 1939 in which you communicated to me the terms of a Canadian-United States Regional Arrangement Governing the Use of Radio for Civil Aeronautical Services, as understood by you to have
been agreed to in the negotiations , now terminated , between the Government of Canada and the Government of the United States of
America .

2. The terms of this Arrangement which you have communicated to me are as follows:

CANADIAN-UNITED STATES REGIONAL ARRANGEMENT GOVERNING THE USE OF Radio for CIVIL AERONAUTICAL SERVICES .
Article I. Scope: The present arrangement between Canada and the United States concerns primarily the radio communication service of civil aeronautics and civil air navigation services. Except for Article XIII , the subject matter of this arrangement is confined to the frequencies 200-400 kc . and above 30,000 kc . Services other than civil aeronautical which may incidentally be involved from the standpoint of interference to and by the civil aeronautical radio services are treated in Article XVII . Nothing in this arrangement shall be construed as lessening in any manner or to any degree the rights enjoyed by the national defense services of either country.
Article II. Application : Nothing in the present arrangement shall contravene the pertinent portions of the International Telecommunication Convention, Madrid , 1932 ; the radio regulations annexed thereto to which the parties to this arrangement have subscribed ; the InterAmerican Radio Communications Convention, Habana, 1937 , and the Inter-American Arrangement on Radio Communications , Habana, 1937 , or such documents as may supplant them as a result of subsequent conferences .
Article III. Standardization : In order that international flying may be facilitated , the standardization and use of aeronautical radio facilities are provided for in this arrangement . Appendix I lists the standard classes of aeronautical radio aids approved for service operation.
Article IV. Geographical Spacing of Aeronautical Stations: In accordance with the general principles governing the economical use of the available channels , assignments shall be duplicated with a minimum practicable geographical separation between stations as determined by permissible ratio of interfering signal to desired signal, characteristics of the frequencies in use, and the areas of operation of the stations concerned .
98907-39- PT. 3- 47

2174

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [53 STAT.
Article V. Sharing of Channels : The principle of the sharing of frequencies which are made available for aeronautical services by international convention is fully recognized , particularly, however, with respect to those allocated to such services by the Inter-American Arrangement Concerning Radio Communications, Habana, 1937 . Recognition is given, however, to the priority of existing services as set forth in Article XVII and Appendix IV. In general, assignments to a new station shall be treated as an individual problem to be solved by engineering methods.
Article VI. Field Intensity: In order that radio interference beyond the service area may be reduced to a minimum, radiated power should ordinarily be adjusted to a value consistent with a normal required field intensity within the prescribed area in which it is desired to render service.
BAND 200-400 KC.
Article VII . Geographical Spacing: In the case of radio range stations in the band 200-400 kc. , the geographical spacing of the stations shall be not less than that prescribed in the curve shown in Appendix II. For powers other than four hundred watts, the distances shown in Appendix II shall be modified accordingly.
Article VIII . Standardization of Quadrant Signals : For uniformity and for purpose of course orientation, the characteristic " N" shall be utilized in the quadrant through which the true north line passes, except when the northerly course is true north, in which case the characteristic signal "N" should be in the northwest and southeast quadrants. The "A" signal should always fall in the quadrants adjacent to those occupied by the "N" signal .
Article IX. Identification Signals : The identification signal employed to identify individual radio range stations shall consist of two letters and shall be assigned without duplication. Where practicable, the signal used to establish the identity of radio facilities at any particular point should correspond to the designator for weather reports from the same station.
Article X. Spacing and Assignment of Channels : The channel spacing for radio range transmitters in the band 200-400 kc. shall be 3 kc. and the radio range channels shall be as set out in Appendix IV.
The frequency assignments to the radio range stations in Canada and the United States shall be set out as in Appendix V.
BAND ABOVE 30,000 KC.
Article XI . Development in Communication: It is recognized that many services of aeronautics may be accommodated in the band above 30,000 kc . It is further recognized that the use of such frequencies for aviation purposes is still on an experimental basis .
The Parties accordingly agree to cooperate in the development of the use of this ultra high frequency band so that frequencies of the same order may be used for similar purposes throughout Canada and

53 STAT. ] CANADA-RADIO : CIVIL AERONAUTICS-FEB. 20, 1939
the United States and that the table shown in Appendix III shall be used as a guide when making assignments in this band for aeronautical use.
Article XII . Ultra High Calling and Working Frequency: If and when ultra high frequencies come into use for aeronautical purposes, 141,780 kc . shall be designated as a calling and working frequency from plane to ground.
GENERAL PROVISIONS
Article XIII . Normal Calling and Working Frequencies: It is agreed that Canada and the United States will use 3105 kc . as the international calling and working frequency for use by itinerant aircraft and for emergency use by transport aircraft. 6210 kc . will also be used for secondary purposes as a calling and working frequency, available to itinerant and other aircraft by arrangement, when the circumstances are such as to make the use of 3105 kc. unsuitable.
Article XIV. Specific Allocation of Airport Control Frequency: The frequency 278 kc. will continue to be used as an airport control frequency with the expectation that after January 1 , 1939 no new assignments to airport control stations on this frequency will be made unless there is installed for simultaneous use facilities for operation on frequencies between 129 and 132 megacycles . It is further proposed that the use of 278 kc. for airport control purposes may be discontinued after January 1 , 1940 and replaced by frequencies between 129 and 132 megacycles.
Article XV. Exchange of Information: Information pertaining to civil aeronautics including frequency assignments , power, location of stations, identification signals and course orientation shall be exchanged directly between the administrative agencies of the two Parties .
Article XVI. Infringements: The Parties undertake to inform each other concerning any infringement of the provisions of this arrangement in order to facilitate corrective action.
Article XVII . Services Other Than Civil Aeronautical: a. National Defense: This arrangement recognizes the paramount requirements of national defense as established by Article 39 of the International Telecommunication Convention , Madrid , 1932 , and by such national legislation in harmony therewith as has been or may in future be enacted.
b. Marine Radiobeacons are recognized as operating in Canada and the United States in the band 285-315 kc. as provided in the Madrid Telecommunication Convention and the General Radio Regulations annexed thereto . The use for aeronautical purposes of these frequencies or immediately adjacent frequencies shall be restricted to locations and powers which will not cause interference with marine radiobeacons along the seacoasts and on the Great Lakes.
c. Marine Direction-Finding Service is recognized as operating in Canada and the United States in the band 365-385 kc. as provided in the Madrid Telecommunication Convention and the General Radio

2175

2176

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [53 STAT.
Regulations annexed thereto . The use for aeronautical purposes of these frequencies or immediately adjacent frequencies shall be restricted to locations and powers which will not cause interference with marine radio direction-finding services .
d. Marine Communication Services are recognized as operating in Canada and the United States on certain frequencies between 385 and 400 kc. as provided in the Madrid Telecommunication Convention and the General Radio Regulations annexed thereto . The use for aeronautical purposes of these frequencies or immediately adjacent frequencies shall be restricted to locations and powers which will not cause interference with marine communication services.
CONCLUSION
Article XVIII . Abrogation : It is mutually agreed that all existing informal undertakings between the Parties or the administrative agencies thereof with respect to radio allocations to aeronautical services provided for herein , are hereby superseded and become inoperative upon the effective date of this arrangement regardless of any contrary provisions for denunciation which may appear in such existing agreements.
Article XIX . Effective Date: The effective date of this arrangement shall be established at the time of the exchange of notes effectuating it.
Article XX . Amendment: The appendices to the present arrangement, but not the arrangement itself, may be amended by mutual agreement of the authorized agencies of the Parties hereto .
Article XXI. Denunciation: The present arrangement shall be subject to termination by either Government upon sixty days ' notice given in writing to the other Government .
3. I also acknowledge the receipt of the enclosures to your note under reference consisting of the appendices to the proposed Arrangement which under the terms of Article XX thereof may be amended by mutual agreement of the authorized agencies of the Parties thereto.
4. I am instructed to state that the terms of the Arrangement as communicated to me are agreed to by my Government . I am further instructed to inform you that my Government concurs in your suggestion that the Arrangement become effective as of the date of this Exchange of Notes and will accordingly regard it as becoming effective on that date.
I have the honour to be with the highest consideration Sir Your most obedient humble servant HERBERT M MARLER

2. The terms of this Arrangement which you have communicated to me are as follows:

CANADIAN-UNITED STATES REGIONAL ARRANGEMENT GOVERNING THE USE OF RADIO FOR CIVIL AERONAUTICAL SERVICES .
Article I. Scope: The present arrangement between Canada and the United States concerns primarily the radio communication service of civil aeronautics and civil air navigation services . Except for Article XIII, the subject matter of this arrangement is confined to the frequencies 200-400 kc . and above 30,000 kc. Services other than civil aeronautical which may incidentally be involved from the standpoint of interference to and by the civil aeronautical radio services are treated in Article XVII . Nothing in this arrangement shall be construed as lessening in any manner or to any degree the rights enjoyed by the national defense services of either country.
Article II. Application : Nothing in the present arrangement shall contravene the pertinent portions of the International Telecommunication Convention, Madrid , 1932 ; the radio regulations annexed thereto to which the parties to this arrangement have subscribed ; the InterAmerican Radio Communications Convention, Habana , 1937, and the Inter-American Arrangement on Radio Communications , Habana , 1937 , or such documents as may supplant them as a result of subsequent conferences .
Article III. Standardization : In order that international flying may be facilitated , the standardization and use of aeronautical radio facilities are provided for in this arrangement. Appendix I lists the standard classes of aeronautical radio aids approved for service operation.
Article IV. Geographical Spacing of Aeronautical Stations : In accordance with the general principles governing the economical use of the available channels, assignments shall be duplicated with a minimum practicable geographical separation between stations as determined by permissible ratio of interfering signal to desired signal, characteristics of the frequencies in use, and the areas of operation of the stations concerned.

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [53 STAT.
Article V. Sharing of Channels: The principle of the sharing of frequencies which are made available for aeronautical services by international convention is fully recognized, particularly, however, with respect to those allocated to such services by the Inter-American Arrangement Concerning Radio Communications, Habana , 1937 . Recognition is given , however, to the priority of existing services as set forth in Article XVII and Appendix IV. In general , assignments to a new station shall be treated as an individual problem to be solved by engineering methods .
Article VI. Field Intensity: In order that radio interference beyond the service area may be reduced to a minimum, radiated power should ordinarily be adjusted to a value consistent with a normal required field intensity within the prescribed area in which it is desired to render service.
BAND 200-400 KC.
Article VII . Geographical Spacing: In the case of radio range stations in the band 200-400 kc . , the geographical spacing of the stations shall be not less than that prescribed in the curve shown in Appendix II. For powers other than four hundred watts, the distances shown in Appendix II shall be modified accordingly .
Article VIII . Standardization of Quadrant Signals : For uniformity and for purpose of course orientation , the characteristic "N" shall be utilized in the quadrant through which the true north line passes, except when the northerly course is true north , in which case the characteristic signal "N" should be in the northwest and southeast quadrants. The "A" signal should always fall in the quadrants adjacent to those occupied by the "N" signal .
Article IX. Identification Signals: The identification signal employed to identify individual radio range stations shall consist of two letters and shall be assigned without duplication . Where practicable, the signal used to establish the identity of radio facilities at any particular point should correspond to the designator for weather reports from the same station.
Article X. Spacing and Assignment of Channels: The channel spacing for radio range transmitters in the band 200-400 kc . shall be 3 kc. and the radio range channels shall be as set out in Appendix IV.
The frequency assignments to the radio range stations in Canada and the United States shall be set out as in Appendix V.
BAND ABOVE 30,000 KC.
Article XI. Development in Communication : It is recognized that many services of aeronautics may be accommodated in the band above 30,000 kc. It is further recognized that the use of such frequencies for aviation purposes is still on an experimental basis .
The Parties accordingly agree to cooperate in the development of the use of this ultra high frequency band so that frequencies of the same order may be used for similar purposes throughout Canada and

53 STAT. ] CANADA-RADIO : CIVIL AERONAUTICS-FEB. 20, 1939
the United States and that the table shown in Appendix III shall be used as a guide when making assignments in this band for aeronautical use.
Article XII . Ultra High Calling and Working Frequency: If and when ultra high frequencies come into use for aeronautical purposes, 141,780 kc . shall be designated as a calling and working frequency from plane to ground.
GENERAL PROVISIONS
Article XIII. Normal Calling and Working Frequencies : It is agreed that Canada and the United States will use 3105 kc. as the international calling and working frequency for use by itinerant aircraft and for emergency use by transport aircraft. 6210 kc . will also be used for secondary purposes as a calling and working frequency, available to itinerant and other aircraft by arrangement, when the circumstances are such as to make the use of 3105 kc . unsuitable.
Article XIV. Specific Allocation of Airport Control Frequency: The frequency 278 kc. will continue to be used as an airport control frequency with the expectation that after January 1 , 1939 no new assignments to airport control stations on this frequency will be made unless there is installed for simultaneous use facilities for operation on frequencies between 129 and 132 megacycles. It is further proposed that the use of 278 kc. for airport control purposes may be discontinued after January 1 , 1940 and replaced by frequencies between 129 and 132 megacycles.
Article XV. Exchange of Information: Information pertaining to civil aeronautics including frequency assignments, power, location of stations, identification signals and course orientation shall be exchanged directly between the administrative agencies of the two Parties .
Article XVI. Infringements : The Parties undertake to inform each other concerning any infringement of the provisions of this arrangement in order to facilitate corrective action.
Article XVII . Services Other Than Civil Aeronautical: a. National Defense : This arrangement recognizes the paramount requirements of national defense as established by Article 39 of the International Telecommunication Convention, Madrid, 1932 , and by such national legislation in harmony therewith as has been or may in future be enacted . b. Marine Radiobeacons are recognized as operating in Canada and the United States in the band 285-315 kc . as provided in the Madrid Telecommunication Convention and the General Radio Regulations annexed thereto. The use for aeronautical purposes of these frequencies or immediately adjacent frequencies shall be restricted to locations and powers which will not cause interference with marine radiobeacons along the seacoasts and on the Great Lakes . c. Marine Direction -Finding Service is recognized as operating in Canada and the United States in the band 365-385 kc. as provided in the Madrid Telecommunication Convention and the General Radio

2175

2176

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [53 STAT.
Regulations annexed thereto . The use for aeronautical purposes of these frequencies or immediately adjacent frequencies shall be restricted to locations and powers which will not cause interference with marine radio direction-finding services .
d. Marine Communication Services are recognized as operating in Canada and the United States on certain frequencies between 385 and 400 kc. as provided in the Madrid Telecommunication Convention and the General Radio Regulations annexed thereto. The use for aeronautical purposes of these frequencies or immediately adjacent frequencies shall be restricted to locations and powers which will not cause interference with marine communication services .
CONCLUSION
Article XVIII . Abrogation : It is mutually agreed that all existing informal undertakings between the Parties or the administrative agencies thereof with respect to radio allocations to aeronautical services provided for herein, are hereby superseded and become inoperative upon the effective date of this arrangement regardless of any contrary provisions for denunciation which may appear in such existing agreements .
Article XIX . Effective Date: The effective date of this arrangement shall be established at the time of the exchange of notes effectuating it.
Article XX . Amendment: The appendices to the present arrangement, but not the arrangement itself, may be amended by mutual agreement of the authorized agencies of the Parties hereto .
Article XXI. Denunciation : The present arrangement shall be subject to termination by either Government upon sixty days ' notice given in writing to the other Government.
3. I also acknowledge the receipt of the enclosures to your note under reference consisting of the appendices to the proposed Arrangement which under the terms of Article XX thereof may be amended by mutual agreement of the authorized agencies of the Parties thereto.
4. I am instructed to state that the terms of the Arrangement as communicated to me are agreed to by my Government. I am further instructed to inform you that my Government concurs in your suggestion that the Arrangement become effective as of the date of this Exchange of Notes and will accordingly regard it as becoming effective on that date.

Statutory provi sions.

"Sec. 350. (a) For the purpose of expanding foreign markets for the products of the United States (as a means of assisting in the present emergency in restoring the American standard of

living, in overcoming domestic unemployment and the present economic depression, in increasing the purchasing power of the

American public, and in establishing and maintaining a better

relationship among various branches of American agriculture,

industry, mining, and commerce) by regulating the admission of

foreign goods into the United States in accordance with the

characteristics and needs of various branches of American pro-

duction so that foreign markets will be made available to those branches of American production which require and are capable

of developing such outlets by affording corresponding market

opportunities for foreign products in the United States, the

President, whenever he finds as a fact that any existing duties or

other import restrictions of the United States or any foreign

country are unduly burdening and restricting the foreign trade

of the United States and that the purpose above declared will

be promoted by the means hereinafter specified , is authorized from time to time-

"(1) To enter into foreign trade agreements with foreign governments or instrumentalities thereof ; and

"(2) To proclaim such modifications of existing duties and other import restrictions, or such additional import restrictions, or

such continuance, and for such minimum periods, of existing

customs or excise treatment of any article covered by foreign trade agreements, as are required or appropriate to carry out any

foreign trade agreement that the President has entered into

hereunder. No proclamation shall be made increasing or de-

creasing by more than 50 per centum any existing rate of duty or transferring any article between the dutiable and free lists. The proclaimed duties and other import restrictions shall apply

to articles the growth, produce, or manufacture of all foreign

growth, produce, or manufacture of any country because of its

discriminatory treatment of American commerce or because of

other acts or policies which in his opinion tend to defeat the purposes set forth in this section ; and the proclaimed duties and

other import restrictions shall be in effect from and after such time

as is specified in the proclamation . The President may at any

time terminate any such proclamation in whole or in part."

LUMBER DECLARATION
The Governments of Canada and the United States of America, desiring to proceed toward the removal of those restrictions on the international trade in lumber which have operated to the disadvantage of their respective lumber industries ;
Recognizing that as a first step towards this objective the duties and taxes levied on lumber imported into the United States from Canada were reduced by 50 per cent to $2 per thousand feet in the Trade Agreement concluded between Canada and the United States of America on November 15 , 1935 ;
Noting that as a consequence of the coming into force of the Trade Agreements signed this day:
(1 ) the United Kingdom duty on softwood lumber in those forms of which the United States is an important supplier of the United Kingdom's requirements will not exceed 16 shillings per standard (approximately $ 2 per thousand feet) , without any restriction as to the quantity that may be imported at the reduced rate of duty;
(2) the preferential margins enjoyed by lumber of Empire origin in the British West Indian Colonies will not exceed $2 per thousand feet ;
(3 ) the Canadian duty on planed or dressed lumber imported from the United States will be reduced by 50 per cent and the special excise

53 STAT.]

CANADA- RECIPROCAL TRADE- NOV. 17, 1938

tax of 3 per cent will be removed from rough and dressed lumber, without any restriction as to the quantity that may be imported either at the reduced rates of duty or free;
(4) the quantity of red cedar shingles that may be imported into the United States free of duty will be fixed at 30 per cent of United States consumption and imports in excess of this quantity will not be dutiable at more than 25 cents per square ;
(5) the quantitative restriction on the importation into the United States of lumber of Douglas fir and Western Hemlock at the reduced rates of duty and tax in effect since January 1st , 1936 , and confirmed by the Trade Agreement signed today, will be removed ; and that
(6) lumber and timber imported from Canada will not be required to be marked to indicate their country of origin.
Noting further that the Governments of Canada , the United Kingdom, and the United States of America are, for their part , prepared to give effect to the arrangement envisaged in the Trade Agreement between the United Kingdom and the United States whereby lumber of the values and sizes therein set forth shall on its importation into the United Kingdom from the United States of America be admitted free of duty as soon as the import excise tax now levied on Canadian lumber imported into the United States is removed .
Have resolved to record their readiness to cooperate, as opportunity occurs, in restoring the reciprocal advantages enjoyed by the timber products of their respective countries prior to the general resort to retaliatory restrictions on the importation of lumber and to confirm their understanding that the Government of Canada will interpose no objection to the reduction by Empire Governments other than the United Kingdom of differential duties now levied on United States lumber to a point at which the margin of preference enjoyed by Canadian lumber will not exceed the duties and taxes now imposed on Canadian lumber on importation into the United States and that when, and for so long as , the United States import excise tax ceases to apply to lumber imported from Canada, Canada will concur in any request it may receive from such Empire Government for the extension to United States lumber of the tariff treatment enjoyed by Canadian lumber.

The Canadian Minister ( Marler) to the Secretary of State (Hull)
No. 58
Arrangement with His Majesty's Minister for Canada presents his compliments to Canada concerning the Secretary of State and has the honour to refer to the question vmiesimtbseirns unoiffodremfenbsye of securing permission for individual members of the Canadian forces.
Defence Forces to visit the United States in uniform. This question was raised in the final paragraph of a note from Secretary of State dated December 10th 1927. The matter of dispensing with the
formality of making application through the diplomatic channel in such cases has received the attention of the interested Canadian authorities.
In the view of the Department of National Defence it is not desirable to dispense with all formality in connection with visits of individual members of the defence forces in uniform from either country to the territory of the other ; it is thought to be questionable whether it would be in the national interest to do so and breaches of etiquette or of the law by visitors in uniform are apt to assume a significant importance.
However in referring to the intimation made by the United States authorities that it is unnecessary to make a specific request for permission for individual members of the defence forces in uniform to visit the United States the Department of National Defence is prepared to issue instructions that individuals of the Canadian Militia Service are not to proceed to the United States in uniform, or to wear uniform when in the United States without first obtaining
permission from the District Officer Commanding by whom a pass will be given to the individual stating the occasion and the period for which the necessary authority has been granted . In the case of the personnel of the Royal Canadian Navy and the Royal Canadian Air Force the necessary authorization will be issued from National Defence headquarters.
In outlining the proposed procedure which the Canadian authorities are willing to apply in the future it would be appreciated if the Legation might be informed whether a similar procedure would be acceptable to the competent authorities of the United States Government. The procedure would be that specific requests for permission for individual members of United States Defence Forces
to visit Canada need not be made through the diplomatic channel and that individuals of the United States Defence Forces visiting Canada in uniform should obtain the permission of their Corps or

2440

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [ 53 STAT.

other appropriate commander and be prepared to show such "pass" to the Canadian immigration inspector at the port of entry.

It is stated that at the present time the Canadian Immigration authorities do not permit entry of uniformed members of the Forces of another country unless permission has been obtained therefor through the diplomatic channel. In the event however that the proposal outlined above is agreeable to the competent authorities of the United States Government consideration will be given by the Director of Immigration in Canada to the issuance of appropriate instructions to the immigration inspectors along the border.
No change is contemplated at present in the procedure for the admission of organized parties of members of the Defence Forces in uniform from either country to the territory of the other.
It is not desired that the new procedure should apply to visits by individual members of police forces in uniform. The Commissioner

of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to whom the question was referred in connection with visits to the United States of individual

members of the force in uniform has stated that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Rules and Regulations forbid a member of the force to enter the United States in uniform without permission apart

from exceptional circumstances. In view of the delay which transmitting a request through the diplomatic channel or securing a pass would entail the Commissioner desires to rely upon the broad statement of the United States authorities referred to in the first

paragraph of the present note that a request for permission is not necessary. It is understood however that the crossing of the boundary without specific authority will be reserved for exceptional circumstances and in accordance with the practice that has been followed heretofore in such matters.

Sir Herbert Marler would be grateful to be informed whether the proposed procedure meets with the approval of the competent authorities of the United States Government and in the event that it does

to be informed of a date upon which it would be convenient to have the said procedure put into effect.

EXCELLENCY :

November 9, 1938.

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of the note addressed

by your Government on September 1 to Ambassador Daniels.¹ Careful examination of that note discloses no grounds that would

justify this Government in modifying the position set forth at length in my notes to you dated July 21 and August 22 , 1938.2 My Govern-

ment must insist that the recognized rules of law and equity require

the prompt payment of just compensation for property that may be expropriated. Therefore, inasmuch as my Government remains con-

vinced of the basic soundness of its position , buttressed as it is by law

and justice, and in view of the scope and content of our recent conver-

sations, in the course of which you informed me of the policy of your Government and of the desire of the Government of Mexico , which is similar to the desire of the Government of the United States , to settle

all difficulties which may arise between the two Governments in a spirit of friendship and of equity, further discussion of the note under reference seems unnecessary.

My Government has a particular desire to safeguard friendship with

Mexico not only because Mexico is one of its nearest neighbors but on

account of the many ways in which ever improving relations, in the

fullest sense, between the two countries could be complementary and

mutually beneficial. It has , therefore, spared no effort to arrive at

prompt, friendly and satisfactory solutions of problems as they arose.

It was in this spirit that last November my Government urged, in

accordance with the principle of just compensation, the desirability

of a comprehensive agreement providing for the compensation of the

American citizens whose properties had been seized by the Mexican Government. It is in that same spirit that I have given every atten-

tion to the proposals of your Government which you recently com-

municated to me. Based upon them, my Government would be

willing to agree to the plan proposed hereafter which, if acceptable to your Government, would resolve at once the present controversy, in

so far as it relates to compensation for American-owned agrarian

properties seized since August 30 , 1927 , that if continued must

MEXICO- EXPROPRIATED LANDS- Nov. 9, 12, 1938 Apr. 17, 18, 1939

seriously impair the friendly relations between the two countries . It is also in this same spirit that I earnestly commend it to the favorable consideration of your Government.
One: Both our Governments are in accord that the values of the American-owned agrarian properties expropriated since August 30, 1927 , be determined by a Commission composed of one representative of each of our Governments, and in case of disagreement, by a third person selected by the Permanent Commission with seat at Washington, as established by the so-called Gondra Treaty.
Two: My Government proposes (a) that the two commissioners be appointed by their respective Governments at once ; (b) that they hold their first meeting in the City of Mexico on the first day of December 1938 : (c) that each Government bear the entire expense of the salaries , maintenance, transportation, and incidentals of its commissioner and his staff and that any expense incurred jointly, as for instance in connection with airplane travel, be shared equally.
Three: My Government believes it important, and understands that your Government is in accord in this regard , that a time limit be established for the completion of the work of the commissioners . It is therefore proposed that the commissioners be instructed that they must complete the determinations of value by not later than May 31 , 1939. If during the course of the deliberations of the two commissioners they are unable to reach a common finding upon the matters submitted to them for their joint determination , my Government proposes that the Permanent Commission at Washington be requested to appoint immediately the third commissioner in order that he may resolve the matters upon which the two Governments ' commissioners are unable to agree . It is further proposed that in case of disagreement in any particular case, the representative appointed by the Permanent Commission be requested to render his award within not more than two months from the time the case is submitted to him. The salaries and expenses of the third commissioner will be defrayed in equal proportions by the two Governments.
Four: The adequate and effective measure of compensation to be paid in each case shall be determined in the usual manner by taking into consideration, among other pertinent factors, the establishment of the nationality of the claimant, the legitimacy of his title, the just value of the property expropriated , the fair return from the property of which claimant has been deprived between the time of expropriation and the time of receiving compensation, as well as such other facts as in the opinion of the commissioners should be taken into account in reaching a determination as to compensation.
Five: It is my understanding that the Mexican Government will pay the sum of $ 1,000,000 United States currency as first payment of the indemnities to be determined by the Commission to which this note refers, and that this payment will be made to the Government of the United States on or before May 31 , 1939.
It is my further understanding that immediately subsequent to the determination by the Commission of the final valuation, in accordance with the procedure indicated in numbered paragraph Four of this

2443

2444

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [53 STAT.
note, of American-owned agrarian properties as defined in numbered paragraph One, the two Governments will reach an agreement as to the amounts to be paid to the Government of the United States by the Government of Mexico annually for the account of such claims in the years subsequent to the year 1939. As the basis for such agreement there will be taken into consideration such statement of its ability to pay as may be demonstrated by the Government of Mexico. The Government of Mexico, I understand , agrees that the annual payments to be made by it to the Government of the United States subsequent to the year 1939 for the account of these claims will in no event be less than $ 1,000,000 United States currency , and that such payments will be made on June 30 of the corresponding year.
In view of our recent conversations I have every confidence that the foregoing proposals will prove acceptable to Your Excellency's Government. I shall await with interest Your Excellency's response to the suggestions made .
Accept, Excellency, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration .

Unidos de Norte América, Dr. Francisco Castillo Nájera, por la que el Gobierno de Vuestra Excelencia , al insistir en su opinión de que los principios reconocidos de derecho y equidad exigen el pago inmediato de justa compensación por bienes que sean expropiados, manifiesta su disposición para convenir en un plan que, basándose en las proposiciones de mi Gobierno, se aplique a la consideración y pago de las afectaciones agrarias posteriores a 1927.
El Gobierno de México , a su vez , al reafirmar su convicción de no haber procedido en contra de las normas y principios del Derecho Internacional, de la justicia y la equidad , con la expedición y aplicación de su Legislación Agraria, está de acuerdo con el plan presentado y se complace en reconocer que los sentimientos de cordial amistad que ligan a nuestros dos países, hayan prevalecido a la postre sobre discrepancias de orden técnico y jurídico .

Mi Gobierno está de acuerdo , también con su intención original , en el sentido de que los representantes de ambos países sean, desde luego, designados y que su primera reunión se efectúe en la ciudad de México el primero de diciembre del año actual . Las erogaciones por concepto de emolumentos, pasajes y otros gastos, tanto de los representantes como de las personas que los secunden en sus trabajos , serán sufragados por cuenta del Gobierno respectivo .

Asimismo, los emolumentos que hayan de pagarse a la mencionada tercera persona se cubrirán, como lo propone vuestro Gobierno , por mitad, entre México y los Estados Unidos.
Mi Gobierno expresamente manifiesta estar de acuerdo en que los representantes designados sean instruídos en el sentido de que sus trabajos de avalúo concluyan en mayo de 1939 , y en que los casos de desacuerdo sean sometidos a la consideración del Tercero , quien deberá ser requerido , igualmente, para que rinda sus decisiones en un plazo no mayor de dos meses, a partir de la fecha en que haya sido solicitada su intervención .
El Gobierno de México entiende que al actuar los comisionados, para hacer el avalúo respectivo , deberán tomar en cuenta , entre otros hechos pertinentes, el establecimiento de la nacionalidad del reclamante, la legalidad de su título para reclamar y el valor fiscal último , previo a la afectación .
En cuanto a la forma de pago de las indemnizaciones correspondientes, mi Gobierno cubrirá en el mes de mayo del año de 1939 , la suma de un millón de dólares.
Mi Gobierno está de acuerdo en que una vez que los representantes fijen el monto de las indemnizaciones, los Gobiernos concierten la suma anual que el Gobierno de México debe pagar al de los Estados Unidos , en los años subsecuentes al de 1939 , por concepto de las reclamaciones de que se trata . Para la fijación de dichos pagos anuales se tomarán en cuenta las posibilidades económicas de México . Mi Gobierno conviene, desde ahora, en que las sumas anuales, que deberán pagarse al Gobierno de los Estados Unidos, no serán inferiores a un millón de dólares moneda de los Estados Unidos y, por último, mi Gobierno está de acuerdo en que los pagos se cubran el día 30 de junio de cada año .
El Gobierno de México estima necesario dejar establecido que las resoluciones a que lleguen los representantes designados , en ningún caso se extenderán más allá del avalúo de las tierras afectadas y de las

modalidades de pago de la cantidad que se fije ; que no constituirán precedente, en ningún caso ni por motivo alguno ; tampoco decidirán sobre los principios jurídicos sostenidos por ambos Gobiernos y aplicables a la materia de que se trata.
El Gobierno de México se complace en reconocer que, al formalizar este arreglo, ha podido , por una parte, demostrar, al igual que lo expresado por el de Vuestra Excelencia en la nota que contesto, el deseo especial de mantener a salvo su amistad con los Estados Unidos , por los mutuos beneficios que este sentimiento recíproco representa para los dos países y cumplir, por la otra, con los mandatos de la Legislación Agraria, expresión de nuestra política tradicional que, al ser interpretada por el C. Presidente de la República , fué apoyada, en forma solemne, por la Representación Nacional, en la respuesta dada al mensaje del Poder Ejecutivo por el C. Presidente del Congreso de la Unión, en la inauguración del período de sesiones del primero de septiembre último .
Aprovecho esta oportunidad para renovar a Vuestra Excelencia las seguridades de mi más alta y distinguida consideración .

MEXICO, November 12, 1938.

MR. AMBASSADOR :

I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of the note dated November 9 , 1938 , addressed by His Excellency Secretary of State Cordell Hull to the Ambassador of Mexico in the United States of Amer-

ica, Dr. Francisco Castillo Nájera, in which the Government of Your Excellency , while maintaining its opinion that the recognized prin-

ciples of law and equity require the immediate payment of just compensation for expropriated properties, makes known its readiness

to agree to a plan which, based on the proposals of my Govern-

ment, may apply to the consideration and payment of agrarian expropriations (afectaciones) subsequent to 1927.
The Government of Mexico , in its turn, while reaffirming its con-

viction that it has not acted contrary to the rules and principles of international law, of justice and equity, by the enactment and application of its agrarian legislation, is in agreement with the plan pre-

sented and takes pleasure in recognizing that the sentiments of cordial friendship which unite our two countries have in the end prevailed

over differences of a technical and juridical order. As was proposed in my note to your Government on August 3 of
the current year, my Government agrees that the value of the expro-

priated lands shall be established by a commission consisting of a

53 STAT. ]

Nov. 9, 12, 1938 MEXICO- EXPROPRIATED LANDS- Apr. 17, 18, 1939

representative of each Government, and that cases of disagreement between these representatives shall be decided by a third person designated by the Permanent Commission, established by the Gondra Pact, which has its seat in Washington, notwithstanding the fact that, in this instance, it is not a matter of an investigating commission , an express function assigned that commission in the said pact.
My Government agrees, likewise, in conformity with its original intention , that the representatives of the two Governments shall be immediately designated and that their first meeting shall take place in the City of Mexico on the 1st day of December of the present year. Outlays for emoluments, travel, and other expenditures, both of the representatives and of the persons assisting them in their work, shall be defrayed by the respective Government. The two Governments shall each pay one-half of the expenses incurred jointly.
Likewise, the emoluments which are to be paid to the third person referred to shall be shared equally, as proposed by your Government, by Mexico and the United States.
My Government expressly declares that it agrees that the representatives designated be instructed to the effect that their work of evaluation be concluded in May 1939 , and that the cases of disagreement be submitted to the consideration of the third person, who will likewise be requested to render his decision within a period of not more than 2 months, counting from the date on which his intervention has been requested .
The Government of Mexico understands that the commissioners , in proceeding to make the respective evaluation , shall take into account, among other pertinent facts, the establishment of the nation-
ality of the claimant , the legality of his title to enter a claim, and the last fiscal valuation prior to the expropriation .
Respecting the manner of payment of the corresponding indemnifications, my Government will pay the amount of one million dollars in the month of May 1939.
My Government is agreed that, once the representatives fix the amount of the indemnifications , the Governments shall agree upon
the annual amount which the Government of Mexico shall pay to that of the United States, in the years subsequent to 1939 , on the claims in question . In the determination of the said annual payments , the economic possibilities of Mexico shall be taken into account. My Government agrees, forthwith, that the annual amounts which must be paid to the United States Government shall not be less than one million dollars, United States currency, and , lastly, my Government agrees that the payments shall be made on the 30th day of June of each year.
The Government of Mexico deems it necessary to have it understood that the decisions reached by the representatives designated shall in no case extend beyond evaluation of the lands expropriated and the modalities of payment of the amount determined ; that they shall not constitute a precedent, in any case nor for any reason ; neither shall they decide the juridical principles maintained by the two Governments and applicable to the matter in question.

2447

2448

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [53 STAT.
The Government of Mexico is pleased to recognize that, in formalizing this arrangement , it has been able , on the one hand, to show, as was expressed in the note to which I reply, its especial desire to safeguard its friendship with the United States, because of the mutual benefits which this reciprocal sentiment represents for both countries, and to carry out , on the other hand, the mandates of the agrarian legislation, an expression of our traditional policy, which, on being interpreted by the President of the Republic, was supported , formally, by the National Legislative Body in the reply given to the message from the Executive by the President of the Congress of the Union at the opening of the period of sessions on September 1 , last .
I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the assurances of my highest consideration.

EXCELLENCY :

I have the honor to refer to the exchange of notes of November 9

and November 12 , 1938 between Your Excellency's Government and my Government on the subject of agrarian claims .

In view of the very limited time now remaining within the period originally contemplated for the examination and evaluation of all the agrarian claims, it would seem that the period of time for the filing of claims might usefully be extended to July 31 , 1939 and the period for the adjudication of claims might be extended to November 30, 1939. It would also seem that both periods might be further extended, if necessary, particularly since, under the provisions of the notes just

mentioned, Mexico will obviously have a period of years in which to complete payments.
It would be understood that the extension of time would be without

prejudice to any other aspect of the agreement of November 9November 12 , 1938 .

Please accept, Excellency, the renewed assurances of my highest and most distinguished consideration .

Mi Gobierno expresa , una vez más, su conocido deseo de que estos asuntos sean definitivamente resueltos y, animado de tal propósito, accede, desde luego, a la solicitud que hace usted en la nota que contesto, y declara su conformidad en que el plazo para presentar reclamaciones ante los Comisionados de ambos países, se prorrogue hasta el 31 de julio del año en curso y, de esa fecha hasta el 30 de noviembre próximo, quede establecido un término para decidir sobre el monto de las reclamaciones presentadas.

THANKSGIVING DAY- 1938 BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
A PROCLAMATION

Thanksgiving Day, 1938 .

I, FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT , President of the United States

Thursday, Novem- of America, do hereby designate Thursday, the twenty-fourth of

bnearted24as, . 1938, desig- November, 1938 , as a day of general thanksgiving .

Our Fathers set aside such a day as they hewed a nation from the

primeval forest. The observance was consecrated when George

Washington issued a Thanksgiving proclamation in the first year of his presidency. Abraham Lincoln set apart "a Day of Thanksgiving and Praise to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the heavens".

Thus from our earliest recorded history , Americans have thanked God for their blessings . In our deepest natures , in our very souls, we,

like all mankind since the earliest origin of mankind, turn to God in time of trouble and in time of happiness . "In God We Trust".
For the blessings which have been ours during the present year we have ample cause to be thankful.
Our lands have yielded a goodly harvest, and the toiler in shop and mill receives a more just return for his labor.
We have cherished and preserved our democracy . We have lived in peace and understanding with our neighbors and have seen the world escape the impending disaster of a general war . In the time of our fortune it is fitting that we offer prayers for unfortunate people in other lands who are in dire distress at this our Thanksgiving Season. Let us remember them in our families and our churches when, on the day appointed, we offer our thanks to Almighty God. May we by our way of living merit the continuance of His goodness. IN WITNESS WHEREOF , I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.

"Sec. 350. (a) For the purpose of expanding foreign markets for the products of the United States (as a means of assisting in the present emergency in restoring the American standard of
living, in overcoming domestic unemployment and the present economic depression, in increasing the purchasing power of the American public, and in establishing and maintaining a better relationship among various branches of American agriculture, industry, mining, and commerce) by regulating the admission of foreign goods into the United States in accordance with the characteristics and needs of various branches of American production so that foreign markets will be made available to those branches of American production which require and are capable
of developing such outlets by affording corresponding market opportunities for foreign products in the United States, the President, whenever he finds as a fact that any existing duties or other import restrictions of the United States or any foreign country are unduly burdening and restricting the foreign trade of the United States and that the purpose above declared will be promoted by the means hereinafter specified , is authorized from time to time-
"(1) To enter into foreign trade agreements with foreign governments or instrumentalities thereof ; and
"(2) To proclaim such modifications of existing duties and other import restrictions, or such additional import restrictions , or such continuance, and for such minimum periods, of existing customs or excise treatment of any article covered by foreign trade agreements, as are required or appropriate to carry out any foreign trade agreement that the President has entered into hereunder. No proclamation shall be made increasing or de-
creasing by more than 50 per centum any existing rate of duty or transferring any article between the dutiable and free lists.
The proclaimed duties and other import restrictions shall apply to articles the growth, produce, or manufacture of all foreign countries, whether imported directly, or indirectly: Provided, That the President may suspend the application to articles the growth, produce, or manufacture of any country because of its discriminatory treatment of American commerce or because of other acts or policies which in his opinion tend to defeat the purposes set forth in this section ; and the proclaimed duties and other import restrictions shall be in effect from and after such time as is specified in the proclamation . The President may at any time terminate any such proclamation in whole or in part."

EMPLOYMENT WEEK AND EMPLOYMENT SUNDAY

As

industry

make

substantial

progress

towards

re-

Employment Week and Employment

covery there are ever-increasing employment opportunities for all SuPnrdeaaym.ble. groups. It is important to our social equilibrium that these oppor-

tunities be equitably shared, and that no group in the population shall feel itself discriminated against in hiring policies. It is particu-

larly important that those men and women who have reached the

age where their family responsibilities are at a peak receive their

fair share of the new jobs, and are at least allowed to compete for

these openings on the basis of their actual qualifications, freed from the handicap of an unfounded prejudice against age alone.
I am mindful of the fact that among those over forty years of age

are a great body of our most experienced, able, and competent workers ; that this group as a whole is not sharing as fully as other age groups in the employment revival ; that many of those over forty have lost their jobs through no personal failing but because of circumstances over which they, and their employers , had no direct control ; that among those over forty and still actively in the labor

market are practically the entire group of World War veterans (whose average age is 46) , a group that is surely entitled to look to
our society for security and economic independence.

A committee of distinguished representatives of industry, labor, and

the public has recently issued its report to the Secretary of Labor in which it analyzes the factual basis for the alleged prejudice against

hiring middle-aged workers and finds no good reasons that would

support the continuance of this prejudice. In view of these considerations, I should like to ask employers

throughout the country to give special consideration to this problem of the middle-aged worker, to review and re-examine their current

policies in order to determine whether applicants who are over forty years of age are being given a fair opportunity to qualify for jobs, and to study their various departments and processes with a view to

seeing where the qualifications and abilities of these older applicants could be utilized . I want to urge social agencies, labor organizations ,

and the general public to join in giving this problem their earnest consideration:
