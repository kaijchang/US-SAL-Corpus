"(3) The terms 'renegotiate' and ' renegotiation ' include a determination by agreement or order under this section of the amount of any excessive profits.
"(4) ( A) The term ' excessive profits' means the portion of the profits derived from contracts with the Departments and subcontracts which is determined in accordance with this section to be excessive.

"Renegotiate," "renegotiation."
"Excessive profits."

In determining excessive profits there shall be taken into consideration the following factors :

" (i ) efficiency of contractor, with particular regard to attain-

ment of quantity and quality production, reduction of costs and economy in the use of materials, facilities, and manpower ;
"(ii) reasonableness of costs and profits, with particular regard to volume of production, normal pre-war earnings, and comparison of war and peacetime products ;

"(iii ) amount and source of public and private capital employed and net worth ;
(iv) extent of risk assumed, including the risk incident to reasonable pricing policies ;
"(v) nature and extent of contribution to the war effort , including inventive and developmental contribution and cooperation with the Government and other contractors in supplying technical assistance ;

"(vi) character of business, including complexity of manufacturing technique, character and extent of subcontracting, and rate of turn-over ;

"(vii ) such other factors the consideration of which the public interest and fair and equitable dealing may require, which factors shall be published in the regulations of the Board from time to time as adopted. "(B) The term ' profits derived from contracts with the Departments and subcontracts' means the excess of the amount received or accrued
under such contracts and subcontracts over the costs paid or incurred with respect thereto. Such costs shall be determined in accordance with the method of cost accounting regularly employed by the contractor in keeping his books, but if no such method of cost accounting has been employed, or if the method so employed does not, in the opinion of the Board or, upon redetermination, in the opinion of The Tax Court of the United States properly reflect such costs, such costs shall be determined in accordance with such method as in the opinion of the Board or, upon redetermination, in the opinion of The Tax

contracts."

Court of the United States does properly reflect such costs. Irrespec-

tive of the method employed or prescribed for determining such costs, no item of cost shall be charged to any contract with a Department or subcontract or used in any manner for the purpose of determining such cost, to the extent that in the opinion of the Board or, upon redetermination, in the opinion of The Tax Court of the United States,

such item is unreasonable or not properly chargeable to such contract or subcontract. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, all items estimated to be allowable as deductions and exclusions under
Chapters 1 and 2 E of the Internal Revenue Code (excluding taxes measured by income) shall, to the extent allocable to such contracts and subcontracts ( or, in the case of the recomputation of the amortization deduction, allocable to contracts with the Departments and subcontracts) , be allowed as items of cost, but in determining the amount of excessive profits to be eliminated proper adjustment shall be made on account of the taxes so excluded , other than Federal taxes, which

ARTICLE VII

A. Either State shall have the right, by compliance with the laws of the other State, to file applications for and receive permits to construct or participate in the construction and use of any dam, storage reservoir, or diversion works in such State for the purpose of conserving and regulating the apportioned water of the other State ; provided, that such right is subject to the rights of the other State to control, regulate, and use water apportioned to it.

To amend the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, as amended, for the purpose

Whereas the increased demand for cigarettes and other tobacco products has resulted in record usages during recent years of burley tobacco ; and

Whereas, due to a shortage of labor and equipment and the need for the production of essential food and fiber crops, the production of burley tobacco has not kept pace with this increased usage ; and

Whereas small growers of burley tobacco could, if their acreage
allotments were increased, produce additional burley tobacco without adversely affecting their production of essential food and fiber crops : Therefore be it

Whereas the fishery resources of the United States and its contiguous waters are so varied and so abundant that the fishery industries at the beginning of the Second World War had assumed a world position with respect to the production of fishery commodities, second only to the position occupied by Japan ; and

byproducts for industrial uses, and upon the fisheries as a recreational pursuit , far exceed even the most optimistic production estimates ; and Whereas it is in the interest of all of the people of the United States to insure the fullest permanent development, utilization, and protection of the marine fishery resources of the high seas which may be subject to utilization by United States nationals, and of the marine and fresh-water fishery resources within the limits of territorial jurisdiction prosecuted both commercially and recreationally : Therefore be it

JOINT RESOLUTION

Declaring the policy of the Congress with respect to the independence of the Philippine Islands, and for other purposes.

Whereas, on December 7, 1941, while the people of the Philippine Islands were peacefully engaged in achieving for themselves their complete political independence in the manner mutually agreed upon by the Government of the United States and the people of the Philippine Islands, which independence was to become fully effective July 4, 1946, the Japanese in a wholly unprovoked , wantonly treacherous, and surprise attack on the people of the Philippines and of the United States, did by military invasion interrupt these orderly and mutually agreeable processes for complete independence of the Philippines ; and
Whereas the American and Filipino troops made a valiant and courageous defense to the aggression of the Japanese invader and were overwhelmed only by the surprise and superior numbers and equipment of the enemy ; and
Whereas the Japanese are now in possession and control of the land , peoples, business, communication, and institutions of the Commonwealth of the Philippines, and because of these circumstances the Filipino people are denied the free use and employment of the processes and political institutions jointly established by the Government of the United States and the Commonwealth of the Philippines for the transaction of private and public business and for the maintenance of liberty, law and order, and justice in the Philippine Islands ; and
Whereas by this possession and invasion the Japanese have attempted to frustrate the free processes to independence in the Philippines by substituting therefor their own puppet government which was conceived in intrigue, born in coercion, and reared primarily for the purpose of Japanese selfishness and aggrandizement and not to achieve the independence and freedom of the Filipino people ; and
Whereas the Government of the United States has solemnly guaranteed to the people of the Philippine Islands the right to be completely free and independent and to select by a free ballot , without any kind of inducement or coercion whatsoever, those who shall hold the elective offices in such government and exercise the power and authority thereof, which solemn guaranties have been temporarily made impossible of fulfillment due to the wantonly treacherous and surprise attack on the free people of the Philippine Islands ; and
Whereas, because of the valiant resistance by the Philippine people, which is even now continuing while the invader occupies parts of the Philippines, and because of the long and unbroken record of loyalty of the Filipino people, both to the cause of complete independence for themselves and to the sovereignty of the United States

while they have been under our flag, and because they have abun-

Requesting the President to urge upon the governments of those countries where
the cultivation of the poppy plant exists, the necessity of immediately limiting the production of opium to the amount required for strictly medicinal and scientific purposes.

rivOaptiivuesm. and its deProposal for limita-
tion on production .

Whereas for nearly forty years the United States of America has led the fight to destroy the illicit traffic in and nonmedical consumption of opium, as evidenced by its abolishing the opium monopoly system which it inherited in the Philippine Islands ; its calling at Shanghai in 1909 the first International Commission to consider

the opium problem ; its suggesting the calling of the three Inter-

national Opium Conferences at The Hague in 1912, 1913, 1914 ; its urging at the International Opium Conference of 1924 and 1925

sponsored by the League of Nations that the only effective way to

suppress the demoralizing use of opium and its derivatives (heroin,

morphine, and so forth) was to control the source of the evil by

limiting the cultivation of the poppy plant to the legitimate medic-

inal and scientific needs of the world ; and its further participation in the Geneva Conference of 1931 to restrict the manufacture

and distribution of narcotic drugs ; and

Whereas the laws of the Chinese Government strictly prohibit the

cultivation of the opium poppy and the use of smoking opium in all territory under its control, and the people of China have

valiantly resisted the attempts of the invading Japanese militarists

to enslave them by encouraging and even compelling the cultivation and use of opium ; and

Whereas final defeat of Japan will terminate the illicit traffic in nar-

cotics which has been carried on by the Japanese military in all

territories they have occupied in the Far East ; and

Whereas the British and the Netherlands Governments have recently

announced their decision to prohibit the use of opium for smok-

ing and not to reestablish their government monopolies for the

sale of smoking opium in the territories formerly controlled by them in the Far East when those territories are freed from Japanese occupation, stating however that the success of their action

must in the final analysis depend upon the cooperation of the opium-growing countries ; and

Whereas because of our military operations in certain other areas

in Asia, there are now thousands of young American citizens in

countries where opium is cultivated and freely available , and other

Americans are on vessels delivering war materials to those countries, which condition constitutes a real threat to the health and welfare of these Americans and affords easy opportunity for the

highly profitable smuggling of opium into the United States where

Resolved, That the President be , and he hereby is , requested to approach the Governments of all opium-producing countries throughout the world, urging upon them in the interest of protecting American citizens and those of our allies and of freeing the world of an age-old evil, that they take immediate steps to limit and control the growth of the opium poppy and the production of opium and its

928

PUBLIC LAWS CH. 729-DEC. 23, 1944

[58 STAT.

POWERS OF THOSE LACKING FULL LEGAL CAPACITY AND OF FIDUCIARIES NOT ENLARGED
SEC. 2. Nothing in this Act shall be construed as enlarging the powers of an infant or other person lacking full legal capacity, or of a trustee, executor, or administrator, or other fiduciary, to make a valid endorsement, assignment, or power of attorney.
CORPORATION NOT FORBIDDEN TO TREAT REGISTERED HOLDER AS OWNER
SEC. 3. Nothing in this Act shall be construed as forbidding a corporation-

(b) to hold liable for calls and assessments a person registered on its books as the owner of shares.
TITLE DERIVED FROM CERTIFICATE EXTINGUISHES TITLE DERIVED FROM A SEPARATE DOCUMENT
SEC. 4. The title of a transferee of a certificate under a power of attorney or assignment not written upon the certificate, and the title of any person claiming under such transferee, shall cease and determine if, at any time prior to the surrender of the certificate to the corporation issuing it, another person, for value in good faith , and without notice of the prior transfer, shall purchase and obtain delivery of such certificate with the endorsement of the person appearing by the certificate to be the owner thereof, or shall purchase and obtain delivery of such certificate and the written assignment or power of attorney of such person, though contained in a separate document.

SEC. 16. The alteration of a certificate, whether fraudulent or not and by whomsoever made, shall not deprive the owner of his title to the certificate and the shares originally represented thereby, and the transfer of such a certificate shall convey to the transferee a good title to such certificate and to the shares originally represented thereby.
