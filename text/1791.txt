All persons warned not to violate said act, or the Indian treaties.

Wh er ea s it hath, been represented to me, that James O'Fallon is levying an armed force in that part of the State of Virginia which is called Kentucky, disturbs the public peace, and sets at defiance the treaties of the United States with the Indian tribes, the act of Congress, intituled " An act to regulate trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes," and my proclamations of the fourteenth and twenty-sixth days of August last, founded thereon ;* And it is. my earnest desire that those who have incautiously associated themselves with the said James O'Fallon, may be warned of their danger, I have therefore thought fit to publish this proclamation, hereby declaring that all persons violating the treaties
and act aforesaid, shall be prosecuted with the utmost rigor of the law. And I do, moreover, require all officers of the United States whom it may
concern, to use their best exertions to bring to justice any persons offending in

the premises. In testimony whereof I have caused the seal of the United States to be

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. April 22, 1793.

A PROCLAMATION.

Whe re as it appears that a state of war exists between Austria, Prussia, Sardinia, Great Britain, and the United Netherlands of the one part, and France on the other, and the duty and interest of the United States require that they should with sincerity and good faith adopt and pursue a conduct friendly and impartial toward the belligerent powers :
I have therefore thought fit, by these presents, to declare the disposition of the United States to observe the conduct aforesaid towards those powers respectively ; and to exhort and warn the citizens of the United States carefully to avoid all acts and proceedings whatsoever, which may in any manner tend to contravene such disposition.
And I do hereby also make known that whosoever of the citizens of the United States shall render himself liable to punishment or forfeiture under the law of nations, by committing, aiding, or abetting hostilities against any of the said powers, or by carrying to any of them those articles which are deemed contraband by the modern usage of nations, will not receive the protection of the United States against such punishment or forfeiture ; and further, that I have given instructions to those officers, to whom it belongs, to cause prosecutions to be instituted against all persons who shall, within the cognizance of the courts of the United States, violate the law of nations, with respect to the powers at war, or any of them.
In testimony whereof, I have caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed to these presents, and signed the same with
[l . s .] my hand. Done at the city of Philadelphia, the twenty-second day of April, one thousand seven hundred and ninety-three, and of the independence of the United States of America the seventeenth.

A PROCLAMATION.

Whe re as I have received information that certain persons, in violation of the laws, have presumed, under colour of a foreign authority, to enlist citizens of the United States, and others, within the State of Kentucky, and have there assembled an armed force for the purpose of invading and plundering the territories of a nation at peace with the said United States: And whereas such unwarrantable measures, being contrary to the laws of nations, and to the duties incumbent on every citizen of the United States, tend to disturb the tranquillity of the same, and to involve them 4n the calamities of war: And, whereas it is the duty of the executive to take care that such criminal proceedings should be suppressed, the offenders brought to justice, and all good citizens cautioned
