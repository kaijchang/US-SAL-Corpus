ADVERTISEMENT .

IN publishing the following Laws, the same plan has been

adopted that was prescribed in the joint resolution of Congress of March 3 , 1845 , authorizing a subscription to the edition of all the Laws of the United States just published by us. As we

procured a careful collation with the records at Washington, by an experienced reader, and have scrupulously followed the origi-

nal, we feel justified in saying that the public can safely rely on this publication . Any seeming errors, therefore, must be attributed to the Rolls, and not to us. Where any thing absolutely

necessary to the sense is omitted in the Rolls, our plan is to insert it in the text, enclosed in brackets .

TREATY WITH THE CREEKS AND SEMINOLES .

Articles of a Treaty made by William Armstrong, P. M. Butler, James Logan, and Thomas L. Judge, Commissioners in Behalfof the United States, of the first Part ; the Creek Tribe of Indians, of the second ; and the Seminole Tribe of Indians , of the third Part.

in said treaty as the country of the Creeks ; and whereas many of the Seminoles have settled and are now living in the Creek country,
while others, constituting a large portion of the tribe, have refused to make their homes in any part thereof, assigning as a reason that they are unwilling to submit to Creek laws and government, and that they are apprehensive of being deprived , by the Creek authorities, of their property ; and whereas repeated complaints have been made to the United States government, that those of the Seminoles who refuse to go into the Creek country have, without authority or right, settled upon lands secured to other tribes, and that they have committed numerous and extensive depredations upon the property of those upon whose lands they have intruded :
Now, therefore, in order to reconcile all difficulties respecting location and jurisdiction, to settle all disputed questions which have arisen , or may hereafter arise, in regard to rights of property, and especially to preserve the peace of the frontier, seriously endangered by the restless and warlike spirit of the intruding Seminoles, the parties to this treaty have agreed to the following stipulations : -

Seminoles, but that, on the contrary, they were deprived, without

adequate compensation, of a considerable extent of valuable territory : And, moreover, the Seminoles, since the Creeks first agreed to receive

them, having been engaged in a protracted and bloody contest, which

has naturally engendered feelings and habits calculated to make them troublesome neighbors : The United States, in consideration of these circumstances, agree that an additional annuity of three thousand

dollars for purposes of education shall be allowed for the term of twenty years ; that the annuity of three thousand dollars provided in the treaty of 1832 for like purposes shall be continued until the deter-

mination of the additional annuity above mentioned . It is further

well as in conformity with the general policy of the United States in relation to the Indian tribes, and the Cherokee nation in particular, that that portion of the Cherokee people known as the " Old Settlers," or " Western Cherokees," had no exclusive title to the terri-
tory ceded in that treaty, but that the same was intended for the use of, and to be the home for , the whole nation , including as well that portion then east as that portion then west of the Mississippi ; and whereas the said board of commissioners further decided that, inasmuch as the territory before mentioned became the common property of the whole Cherokee nation by the operation of the treaty of 1828, the Cherokees then west ofthe Mississippi , by the equitable operation of the same treaty, acquired a common interest in the lands occupied by the Cherokees east of the Mississippi River, as well as in those occupied by themselves west of that river, which interest should have been provided for in the treaty of 1835 , but which was not, except in so far as they, as a constituent portion of the nation , retained, in proportion to their numbers , a common interest in the country west of the Mississippi, and in the general funds of the nation ; and therefore they have an equitable claim upon the United States for the value of that interest, whatever it may be. Now, in order to ascertain the How the value value of that interest, it is agreed that the following principle shall be of said inatsecreers-t adopted, viz.: all the investments and expenditures which are properly sthaailnledb. e chargeable upon the sums granted in the treaty of 1835, amounting in Ind.

Settlers (or Western Cherokees ) a sum equai to one third part of said residuum, to be distributed per capita to eacl. individual of said party of " Old Settlers," or " Western Cherokees." It is further agreed that, so far as the Western Cherokees are concerned , in estimating the expense of removal and subsistence of an Eastern Cherokee, to be charged to the aggregate fund of five million six hundred thousand dollars above mentioned, the sums for removal and subsistence stipulated in the 8th article of the treaty of 1835, as commutation money in those cases in which the parties entitled to it removed themselves, shall be adopted. And as it affects the settlement with the Western Cherokees, there shall be no deduction from the fund before mentioned in consideration of any payments which may hereafter be made out of said fund ; and it is hereby further understood and agreed, that the principle above defined shall embrace all those Cherokees west of the Mississippi, who emigrated prior to the treaty of 1835.

TREATY WITH THE STOCKBRIDGE INDIANS . Nov. 24 , 1848. 955

TREATY WITH THE STOCKBRIDGE TRIBE OF INDIANS .

WHEREAS, by an act of Congress, entitled " An Act for the relief of the Stockbridge tribe of Indians, in the Territory of Wisconsin ," approved on the third day of March, A. D. , 1843, it was provided that the township of land on the east side of Winnebago Lake, secured to said tribe by the treaty with the Menomonee Indians of February 8th , 1831 , as amended by the Senate of the United States, and not heretofore ceded by said tribe to the United States, should be divided and allotted among
the individual members of said tribe, by commissioners to be elected for that purpose, who were to make report of such division and allotment, and thereupon the persons composing said tribe were to become citizens of the United States.

Nov. 24, 1848.
1843, ch. 101 . Preamble.
Ratified March 1, 1849.

And whereas a portion of said tribe refused to recognize the validity of said act of Congress , or the proceedings which were had under it, or to be governed by its provisions, and upon their petition a subsequent act was passed by the Congress of the United States, on the 6th day of August, 1846, repealing the said act of March 3d , 1843 , and providing, among other things, that such of said tribe as should enrol themselves with the sub-agent of Indian affairs at Green Bay , should be and remain citizens of the United States , and the residue of said tribe were restored to their ancient form of government as an Indian tribe. It was also provided that the said township of land should be divided into two districts, one of which was to be known as the " Indian district," the other as the " citizen district ; " the former to be held in common by the party who did not desire citizenship, and the latter to be divided and allotted among such as were citizens and desired to remain so.

1846, ch. 85.

And whereas it has been found impracticable to carry into full effect the provisions of the act of August 6th, 1846, by dividing the said township of land in the manner specified in said act, without infringing upon private rights acquired in good faith under the act of 1843 hereinbefore referred to , with a view of relieving both the Indian and citizen parties of said Stockbridge tribe of Indians from their present embarrassments, and to secure to each their just rights , articles of agreement and compromise have been entered into, as follows :-

to employ.

Absolute freedom shall be given in all cases to the buyer and seller to bargain together, and to fix the price of any goods or merchandise imported into, or to be exported from, the states and dominions of the two

contracting parties, save and except generally such cases wherein the

laws and usages of the country may require the intervention of any

special agents in the states and dominions of the contracting parties. But nothing contained in this or any other article of the present treaty

shall be construed to authorize the sale of spirituous liquors to the natives of the Sandwich Islands, farther than such sale may be allowed by the Hawaiian laws.

ARTICLE X.

Consuls, &c.

Each of the two contracting parties may have, in the ports of the other, consuls , vice-consuls, and commercial agents, of their own appointment, who shall enjoy the same privileges and powers with those of the most favored nations ; but if any such consuls shall exercise

to require the assistance of the local authorities for the search, arrest,
detention and imprisonment of the deserters from the ships of war and
merchant vessels of their country. For this purpose they shall apply

to the competent tribunals, judges, and officers, and shall, in writing, demand the said deserters, proving, by the exhibition of the registers of the vessels, the rolls of the crews, or by other official documents,

that such individuals formed part of the crews ; and this reclamation being thus substantiated , the surrender shall not be refused. Such

deserters, when arrested , shall be placed at the disposal of the said

consuls , vice-consuls, or commercial agents, and may be confined in the public prisons, at the request and cost of those who shall claim

them, in order to be detained until the time when they shall be restored to the vessel to which they belonged, or sent back to their own country by a vessel of the same nation, or any other vessel whatsoever. The agents, owners, or masters of vessels on account of whom the deserters

have been apprehended, upon requisition of the local authorities, shall

be required to take or send away such deserters from the states and

dominions of the contracting parties, or give such security for their good conduct as the law may require. But if not sent back nor

reclaimed within six months from the day of their arrest , or if all the

expenses of such imprisonment are not defrayed by the party causing such arrest and imprisonment, they shall be set at liberty, and shall not be again arrested for the same cause. However, if the deserters should

saved therefrom, or the produce thereof, if sold, shall be faithfully re-

stored with the least possible delay to the proprietors, upon being claimed by them , or by their duly authorized factors ; and if there are no such

proprietors or factors on the spot, then the said goods and merchandise,

or the proceeds thereof, as well as all the papers found on board such wrecked ships or vessels, shall be delivered to the American or Ha-

waiian consul, or vice-consul, in whose district the wreck may have taken

place ; and such consul, vice-consul, proprietors, or factors, shall pay

only the expenses incurred in the preservation of the property, together with the rate of salvage and expenses of quarantine which would have been payable in the like case of a wreck of a national vessel ; and

the goods and merchandise saved from the wreck shall not be subject to duties unless entered for consumption , it being understood that in case of any legal claim upon such wreck, goods, or merchandise, the

same shall be referred for decision to the competent tribunals of the

country.

The contracting parties mutually agree to surrender, upon official requisition, to the authorities of each, all persons who, being charged with the crimes of murder, piracy, arson, robbery, forgery, or the utterance of forged paper, committed within the jurisdiction of either, shall be found within the territories of the other, provided that this shall only be done upon such evidence of criminality as, according to the laws of the place where the person so charged shall be found, would justify his apprehension and commitment for trial, if the crime had there been
committed ; and the respective judges and other magistrates of the two governments shall have authority, upon complaint made under oath, to

TREATY WITH THE WYANDOT INDIANS .

April 1, 1850.

Consent of SenArticles of a Convention concluded in the city of Washington, this ate Sept. 24,

first day of April, one thousand eight hundred and fifty, by and 185P0r, oclamation between Ardavan S. Loughery, Commissioner especially appointed made Sept 30

by the President of the United States, and the undersigned, Head 1850.

Chief and Deputies of the Wyandot Tribe of Indians, duly author-

ized and empowered to act for their tribe.

[WHEREAS , the people composing the Wyandot tribe or nation of Indians have manifested an anxious desire to extinguish their tribal or national character and become citizens of the United States - believing their condition will, thereby, not only be ameliorated , but their welfare and prosperity greatly promoted. They have arrived at this conviction in view of the fact that a new territory will , at no distant period , be organized by the government of the United States, which will embrace
within its limits their present lands and possessions, and thus they will again be surrounded by citizens of the United States. After a full consultation with their people, and upon mature reflection , the undersigned, representatives of the Wyandot nation, entertain the belief, that the evil effects always to be apprehended from such a state of things will be avoided by their becoming citizens of the United States, and having the lands and other property accruing under treaty stipula tions, now held in common by their people, fairly and equally divided among the individual owners, and secured to them in severalty :
And, whereas, by the first article of the treaty concluded between

the United States and the Wyandot nation or tribe of Indians, on the 17th day of March, one thousand eight hundred and forty-two , the said nation ceded and relinquished to the United States all the lands and possessions owned or claimed by them, within the limits of the States of Ohio and Michigan -in consideration of which cession , the United States, by the second article of the treaty aforesaid, stipulate and agree to " grant to the Wyandot nation a tract of land west of the

Mississippi River, to contain one hundred and forty-eight thousand acres, and to be located upon any lands owned by the United States, now set apart, or may in future set apart, for Indian use, and not already assigned to any other tribe or nation." And in further

consideration of the aforesaid cession by the Wyandot nation , the

United States, by the third and succeeding articles of said treaty, agree ""
to pay the Wyandot nation a perpetual annuity of seventeen thousand

five hundred dollars ( $ 17,500 ) in specie," beside making other provis-

ion for the benefit of said nation , as follows : Blacksmith and assistant,

$750 -- iron and steel

for

shop ,

$270

--

and

purposes ,

$500- all of which to be furnished and paid annually. It being

expressly stipulated in the 3d article of the treaty before mentioned , that the annuity of seventeen thousand five hundred dollars should

include " all former annuities." And, whereas, the Wyandot tribe of Indians were not put in pos-

session of the one hundred and forty-eight thousand acres of land, as

stipulated in the second article of the treaty aforesaid ; and they aver that, in consequence of the United States having failed to comply with

that stipulation, by not designating and conveying to them a country

fit for farming purposes and suited to their wants, they were compelled to purchase a home, of which they were then destitute, from another

tribe of Indians. Accordingly, on the fourteenth day of December, one

thousand eight hundred and forty-three, they entered into a contract with the Delaware nation of Indians, by which they purchased of the last-mentioned nation a tract of land containing thirty-six sections, (or twenty-three thousand and forty acres,) and had granted to them , as a donation, three sections, (or nineteen hundred and twenty acres, ) in addition, as set forth in the 1st and 2d articles of said contract or treaty, wherein these two tracts or sections of land are described as follows :
"Three sections of land, containing six hundred and forty acres each, lying and being situated at the point of the junction of the Missouri and Kansas Rivers," -- and the " thirty-six sections of land, each containing 640 acres, situated between the aforesaid Missouri and Kansas Rivers, and adjoining on the west the aforesaid three donated sections, making in all thirty-nine sections of land, bounded as follows, viz.: Commencing at the point at the junction of the aforesaid Missouri and Kansas Rivers, running west along the Kansas River sufficiently far to include the aforesaid thirty-nine sections ; thence running north to the Missouri River ; thence down the said river with its meanders
to the place of beginning ; to be surveyed in as near a square form as the rivers and territory ceded will admit of."
And, whereas, this said contract or treaty was ratified and confirmed by the United States, by a joint resolution of Congress, approved July 1848. res. 19. 25, 1848 ; and which contains only the following proviso : " That the Wyandot Indian nation shall take no better right or interest in and to said lands than is now vested in the Delaware nation of Indians."
The representatives of the Wyandot nation, therefore, present a claim against the United States for the price of one hundred and fortyeight thousand acres of land granted by the 2d article of the aforesaid treaty of March 17 , 1842 , -fixing that price at one dollar and twentyfive cents per acre, and which claim, they conceive, is strengthened, if not rendered valid, by the recognition of their purchase from the Delaware Indians on the part of the United States, as shown by the resolution confirmatory thereof, above cited. And they now ask that the sum of one hundred and eighty-five thousand dollars be allowed and paid to the Wyandot people in commutation of said claim.
And, whereas, the commissioner on behalf of the United States, having carefully and attentively examined the application presented to him on behalf of the Wyandot nation, both in regard to their desire to become citizens of the United States, and of their claim for payment, in money, for the lands granted to them by the treaty of 1842 ; and having, also, examined the public documents and other proofs having reference to the subject, he is induced to believe, first, that the Wyandot people have so far advanced in civilization as to be capable, generally, of managing their own affairs, and are qualified and calculated to become useful citizens, a large portion whereof being already en gaged in agricultural pursuits ; and, secondly, that they have an equitable claim on the United States for the value of the lands granted to them by the treaty of 1842, aforesaid, but of which lands they were not possessed, in compliance with the stipulations of said treaty. In arriving at this conclusion, however, it is expressly understood, that it is not to be considered as an admission by the United States of either the policy or expediency of commuting lands granted to Indian tribes under treaty stipulations, for money, or in fixing the value of such lands so as to serve as a precedent hereafter. But, under the peculiar circumstances of this case, and especially in view of the Wyandot tribe of Indians agreeing to extinguish their national existence, and become citizens of the United States, thereby relinquishing all claims now held, in their national or collective capacity, against the United States, the commissioner aforesaid has agreed with the Wyandot chief and deputies, parties hereto, to conclude the following articles, to wit:

7. Respecting an Invasion of Cuba. BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

A PROCLAMATION.

THERE is reason to believe that an armed expedition is about to be fitted out in the United States, with an intention to invade the Island of Cuba, or some of the Provinces of Mexico. The best information which the executive
has been able to obtain, points to the Island of Cuba as the object of this expedition. It is the duty of this government to observe the faith of treaties, and to prevent any aggression by our citizens upon the territories of friendly nations. have therefore thought it necessary and proper to issue this proc-
lamation, to warn all citizens of the United States who shall connect themselves with an enterprise so grossly in violation of our laws and our treaty obligations, that they will thereby subject themselves to the heavy penalties denounced against them by our acts of Congress, and will forfeit their claim to the protection of their country. No such persons must expect the interference of this government, in any form, on their behalf, no matter to what extremities they may be reduced in consequence of their conduct. An enterprise to invade the territories of a friendly nation, set on foot and prosecuted within the limits of the United States, is in the highest degree criminal, as tending to endanger the peace, and compromit the honor, of this nation : - and,
therefore, I exhort all good citizens, as they regard our national reputation ; as they respect their own laws, and the laws of nations ; as they value the bless-
ings of peace and the welfare of their country, to discountenance and prevent, by all lawful means, any such enterprise ; and I call upon every officer of this government, civil or military, to use all efforts in his power to arrest, for trial and punishment, every such offender against the laws providing for the performance of our sacred obligations to friendly powers.

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

A PROCLAMATION.

WHEREAS, by an act of the Congress of the United States of the ninth of September, one thousand eight hundred and fifty, entitled " An Act proposing to the State of Texas the establishment of her northern and western bounda-
ries, the relinquishment by the said State of all territory claimed by her exterior to said boundaries, and of all her claims upon the United States, and to establish a territorial government for New Mexico," it was provided, that the following propositions should be, and the same were thereby, offered to the State of Texas, which, when agreed to by the said State, in an act passed by the General Assembly, should be binding and obligatory upon the United States and upon the said State of Texas : Provided, The said agreement by the
said General Assembly should be given on or before the first day of December, eighteen hundred and fifty ; namely : -
"First. The State of Texas will agree that her boundary on the north shall commence at the point at which the meridian of one hundred degrees west from Greenwich is intersected by the parallel of thirty-six degrees thirty min-
utes north latitude, and shall run from said point due west to the meridian of one hundred and three degrees west from Greenwich ; thence her boundary shall run due south to the thirty-second degree of north latitude ; thence on the said parallel of thirty-two degrees of north latitude to the Rio Bravo del Norte, and thence with the channel of said river to the Gulf of Mexico."
" Second. The State of Texas cedes to the United States all her claim to
territory exterior to the limits and boundaries which she agrees to establish by the first article of this agreement."
"Third. The State of Texas relinquishes all claim upon the United States for liability of the debts of Texas, and for compensation or indemnity for the surrender to the United States of her ships, forts, arsenals, custom-houses, custom-house revenues, arms and munitions of war, and public buildings with
their sites, which became the property of the United States at the time of the annexation."
"Fourth. The United States, in consideration of said establishment of
boundaries, cession of claim to territory, and relinquishment of claims, will pay to the State of Texas the sum of ten millions of dollars in a stock bearing five per cent. interest, and redeemable at the end of fourteen years, the interest payable half-yearly at the treasury of the United States."
66 Fifth. Immediately after the President of the United States shall have been furnished with an authentic copy of the act of the General Assembly of Texas accepting these propositions, he shall cause the stock to be issued in favor of the State of Texas, as provided for in the fourth article of this agreement: Provided also, That no more than five millions of said stock shall be issued until the creditors of the State holding bonds and other certificates of stock of Texas for which duties on imports were specially pledged, shall first file at the treasury of the United States releases of all claim against the United States for or on account of said bonds or certificates in such form as shall be prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury and approved by the President of the United States. Provided, That nothing herein contained shall be construed to impair or qualify any thing contained in the third article of the second section ofthe ' joint resolution for annexing Texas to the United States,' approved March first, eighteen hundred and forty-five, either as regards the number of States, that may hereafter be formed out of the State of Texas, or otherwise."
And whereas it was further provided, by the eighteenth section of the same act of Congress, " That the provisions of this act be, and they are hereby, suspended until the boundary between the United States and the State of
Texas shall be adjusted, and when such adjustment shall have been effected, the President of the United States shall issue his proclamation declaring this act to be in full force and operation : "
And whereas the Legislature of the State of Texas, by an act approved the twenty-fifth of November last, entitled " An Act accepting the propositions made by the United States to the State of Texas, in an Act of the Congress ofthe United States approved the ninth day of September, A. D. one thousand eight hundred and fifty, and entitled ' An Act proposing to the State of Texas

11. Respecting the Rescue ofan alleged Fugitive Slave at Boston. A PROCLAMATION.

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE United States.

Feb. 18, 1851.

WHEREAS information has been received, that sundry lawless persons, prin-

cipally persons of color, combined and confederated together, for the purpose of opposing by force the execution of the laws of the United States, did, at Boston, in Massachusetts, on the fifteenth of this month, make a violent assault
on the Marshal or Deputy Marshals of the United States, for the district of Massachusetts, in the Court-House, and did overcome the said officers, and
did, by force, rescue from their custody a person arrested as a fugitive slave,
and, then and there, a prisoner lawfully holden by the said Marshal or Deputy Marshals of the United States, and other scandalous outrages did commit, in violation of law:

Now, therefore, to the end that the authority of the laws may be maintained, and those concerned in violating them brought to immediate and condign punishment, I have issued this my Proclamation , calling on all well-disposed citizens to rally to the support of the Laws of their Country, and requiring and commanding all officers, civil and military, and all other persons, civil or military, who shall be found within the vicinity of this outrage, to be aiding and assisting, by all means in their power, in quelling this, and other such combi-

nations, and assisting the Marshal and his Deputies in recapturing the abovementioned prisoner ; and I do, especially, direct, that prosecutions be commenced against all persons who shall have made themselves aiders or abettors in or to this flagitious offence ; and I do further command, that the District Attorney of the United States, and all other persons concerned in the administration or execution of the Laws of the United States, cause the fore-

going offenders, and all such as aided, abetted, or assisted them , or shall be found to have harbored or concealed such fugitive, contrary to law, to be im-

mediately arrested and proceeded with according to law.

Given under my hand, and the seal of the United States, this 18th day

[L. s. ] of February, 1851 .
