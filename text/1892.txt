catches as in the opinion of the Arbitrators might have been taken

ers to take seals within the said waters, then compensation shall be made

dred a season, upon the basis of the difference between this number and

the circumstances is just and equitable, and shall be promptly paid.

And whereas the Charge d'Affaires of the German Empire at Washington has communicated to the Special Plenipotentiary of the United States the fact that, in view of the Act of Congress above cited, the German Imperial Government has, by due legal enactment, authorized the admission, from and after February 1, 1892, into the German Empire, of the articles or merchandise, the product of the United States of America, named in the following schedule, on the terms stated therein:

Whereas, by a Joint Resolution, approved June 29, 1892, it was resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, "That the President of the United States be authorized and directed to issue a proclamation recommending to the people the observance in all their localities of the four hundredth anniversary of the discovery of America, on the twenty-first of October, eighteen hundred and ninety-two, by public demonstrations and by suitable exercises in their schools and other places of assembly;"
Now, therefore, 1, Benjamin Harrison, President of the United States of America, in pursuance of the aforesaid joint resolution do hereby appoint Friday, October 21, 1892, the four hundredth anniversary of the Discovery of America by Columbus, as a general holiday for the people of the United States. On that day let the people, so far as possible, cease from toil and devote themselves to such exercises as may best express honor to the Discoverer and their appreciation of the great achievements of the four completed centuries of American life.
Columbus stood in his age as the pioneer of progress and enlightenment. The system of universal education is in our age the most prominent and salutary feature of the spirit of enlightenment, and it is peculiarly appropriate that the schools be made by the people the center of the day's demonstration. Let the National Flag float over every school house in the country, and the exercises be such as shall impress upon our youth the patriotic duties of American citizenship.
In the churches and in the other places of assembly of the people, let there be expressions of gratitude to Divine Providence for the devout faith of the Discoverer, and for the Divine care and guidance which has directed our history and so abundantly blessed our people.

Persons iu insurrection in Idaho commanded to disperse.

To whom it may concern: Whereas, the Governor of the State of Idaho has represented to me
that within said State there exists an insurrection and condition of domestic violence and resistance to the laws, to meet and overcome which, the resources at his command are unequal; and
Whereas, he has further represented that the Legislature of said State is not now in session, and cannot be promptly convened; and
Whereas, by reason of said conditions the said Governor, as Chief Executive of the State, has called upon me, as Chief Executive of the Government of the United States, for assistance in repressing said violence and restoring and maintaining the peace;
Now, therefore, I, Benjamin Harrison, President of the United States, by virtue of Section 4, Article 4, of the Constitution of the United States, and of the laws of Congress enacted in pursuance thereof, do hereby command all persons engaged in said insurrection and in resistance to the laws, to immediately disperse and retire peaceably to their respective abodes.

Whereas, by a Joint Resolution, approved June 29, 1892, it was resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, "That the President of the United States be authorized and directed to issue a proclamation recommending to the people the observance in all their localities of the four hundredth anniversary of the discovery of America, on the twenty-first of October, eighteen hundred and ninety-two, by public demonstrations and by suitable exercises in their schools and other places of assembly;"
Now, therefore, 1, Benjamin Harrison, President of the United States of America, in pursuance of the aforesaid joint resolution do hereby appoint Friday, October 21, 1892, the four hundredth anniversary of the Discovery of America by Columbus, as a general holiday for the people of the United States. On that day let the people, so far as possible, cease from toil and devote themselves to such exercises as may best express honor to the Discoverer and their appreciation of the great achievements of the four completed centuries of American life.
Columbus stood in his age as the pioneer of progress and enlightenment. The system of universal education is in our age the most prominent and salutary feature of the spirit of enlightenment, and it is peculiarly appropriate that the schools be made by the people the center of the day's demonstration. Let the National Flag float over every school house in the country, and the exercises be such as shall impress upon our youth the patriotic duties of American citizenship.
In the churches and in the other places of assembly of the people, let there be expressions of gratitude to Divine Providence for the devout faith of the Discoverer, and for the Divine care and guidance which has directed our history and so abundantly blessed our people.

To whom it may concern: Whereas, the Governor of the State of Idaho has represented to me
that within said State there exists an insurrection and condition of domestic violence and resistance to the laws, to meet and overcome which, the resources at his command are unequal; and
Whereas, he has further represented that the Legislature of said State is not now in session, and cannot be promptly convened; and

Now, therefore, I, Benjamin Harrison, President of the United States, by virtue of Section 4, Article 4, of the Constitution of the United States, and of the laws of Congress enacted in pursuance thereof, do hereby command all persons engaged in said insurrection and in resistance to the laws, to immediately disperse and retire peaceably to their respective abodes.

Whereas, by an act of Congress approved July 26,1892, entitled "An act to enforce reciprocal commercial relations between the United States and Canada, and for other purposes," it is provided "That, with a view of securing reciprocal advantages for the citizens, ports, and vessels of the United States, on and after the first day of August, eighteen hundred and ninety two, whenever and so often as the President shall be satisfied that the passage through any canal or lock connected with the navigation of the Saint Lawrence River, the Great Lakes, or the water ways connecting the same, of any vessels of the United States, or of cargoes or passengers in transit to any port of the United States, is prohibited or is made difficult or burdensome by the imposition of tolls or otherwise which, in view of the free passage through the St. Marys Falls Canal, now permitted to vessels of all nations, he shall deem to be reciprocally unjust and unreasonable, he shall have the power, and it shall be his duty, to suspend, by proclamation to that effect, for such time and to such extent (including absolute prohibition) as he shall deem just, the right of free passage through the Saint Marys Falls Canal, so far as it relates to vessels owned by the subjects of the government so discriminating against the citizens, ports, or vessels of the United States, or to any cargoes, portions of

cargoes, or passengers in transit to the ports of the government making such discrimination, whether carried in vessels of the United States or of other nations.
"In such case and during such suspension tolls shall be levied, collected, and paid as follows, to wit: Upon freight of whatever kind or description, not to exceed two dollars per ton; upon passengers, not to exceed five dollars each, as shall be from time to time determined by the President: Provided, That no tolls shall be charged or collected upon freight or passengers carried to and landed at Ogdensburg, or any port west of Ogdensburg, and south of a line drawn from the northern boundary of the State of New York through the Saint Lawrence River, the Great Lakes, and their connecting channels to the northern boundary of the State of Minnesota.
"Sec . 2. All tolls so charged shall be collected under such regulations as shall be prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, who may require the master of each vessel to furnish a sworn statement of the amount and kind of cargo and the number of passengers carried and the destination of the same, and such proof of the actual delivery of such cargo or passengers at some port or place within the limits above named as he shall deem satisfactory; and until such proof is furnished such freight and passengers may be considered to have been landed at some port or place outside of those limits, and the amount of tolls which would have accrued if they had been so delivered shall constitute a lien, which may be enforced against the vessel in default whereever and whenever found in the waters of the United States," and
Whereas, the Government of the Dominion of Canada imposes a toll amounting to about 20 cents per ton on all freight passing through the Welland Canal in transit to a port of the United States, and also a further toll on all vessels of the United States and on all passengers in transit to a i>ort of the United States, all of which tolls are without rebate. ' And
Whereas, the Government of the Dominion of Canada in accordance with an order in council of April 4, 1892, refunds 18 cents per ton, of the 20 cent toll at the Welland Canal, on wheat, Indian corn, pease, bailey, rye, oats, flaxseed and buckwheat, upon condition that they are originally shipped for and carried to Montreal, or some port east of Montreal for export, and that, if transhipped at an intermediate point, such transhipment is made within the Dominion of Canada, but allows no such nor any other rebate on said products, when shipped to a port of the United States, or when carried to Montreal for export if transhipped within the United States. And
Whereas, the Government of the Dominion of Canada by said system of rebate and otherwise discriminates against the citizens of the United States in the use of said Welland Canal in violation of the provisions of Article 27 of the Treaty of Washington concluded May 8, 1871. And
Whereas, said Welland Canal is connected with the navigation of the Great Lakes, and 1 am satisfied that the passage through it of cargoes in transit to ports of the United States is made difficult and burdensome by said discriminating system of rebate and otherwise, and is reciprocally unjust aud unreasonable,
Now, therefore, I, Benjamin Harrison, President of the United States, of America, by virtue of the power to that end conferred upon me by said act of Congress approved July 26,1892, do hereby direct that from and after September 1, 1892, until further notice, a toll of 20 cents per ton be levied, collected, and paid on all freight of whatever kind or description passing through the St. Mary's Falls Canal in transit to any port of the Dominion of Canada, whether carried in vessels of the United States or of other nations; and to that extent I do hereby suspend from and after said date the right of free passage through said St. Mary's Falls Canal of any and all cargoes or portions of cargoes in transit to Canadian ports.

not a call, but only the appointment of a day when it may have a com-

The gifts of God to our people during the past year have been so

abundant and so special that the spirit of devout thanksgiving awaits

not a call, but only the appointment of a day when it may have a com-

mon expression. He has stayed the pestilence at our door; He has

given us more love for the free civil institutions in the creation of which

His directing Providence was so conspicuous; He has awakened a

deeper reverence for law; He has widened our philanthropy by a call

to succor the distress in other lands; He has blessed our schools and is

bringing forward a patriotic and God-fearing generation to execute His

great and benevolent designs for our country; He has given us great

increase in material wealth and a wide diffusion of contentment and

comfort in the homes of our people; He has given His grace to the sor-
