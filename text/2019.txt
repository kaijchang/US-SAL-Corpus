Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ``Stephen Michael Gleason Congressional Gold Medal Act''.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
The Congress finds the following: (1) Stephen ``Steve'' Gleason was born March 19, 1977,
in Spokane, Washington to Mike and Gail Gleason. (2) Steve attended Gonzaga Preparatory School for high
school where he excelled as both a football and baseball player. (3) In 1995, Steve enrolled at Washington State University
where he was a 2-sport athlete for the baseball and football teams and helped the Cougars football team advance to the 1997 Rose Bowl.
(4) In 2000, Steve signed a professional football contract with the Indianapolis Colts of the National Football League as an undrafted free agent but later joined the New Orleans Saints in November of that same season.
(5) Steve would go on to play 7 more seasons as a member of the New Orleans Saints.
(6) Steve will always be remembered for his blocked punt on September 25, 2006, against the Atlanta Falcons, the night the Louisiana Superdome reopened for the first time after Hurricane Katrina in a game the Saints would win 23 to 3.
(7) In January, 2011 Steve was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or ALS, considered a terminal neuro-muscular disease.
(8) Following his diagnosis, Steve, with the loving support of his wife, Michel, began a mission to show that patients can not only live but thrive after a diagnosis of ALS and established The Gleason Initiative Foundation also known simply as ``Team Gleason''.
(9) At the time of his diagnosis, however, Steve said there will be ``No White Flags'', which has become the mantra of Team Gleason.
(10) The Gleason Initiative Foundation helps provide individuals with neuromuscular diseases or injuries with leading edge technology, equipment and services, raises global awareness about ALS to find solutions and an end to the

disease, and has helped hundreds of people with ALS experience life adventures they never thought possible after their diagnosis.
(11) Steve's story and mission have been told by the NFL Network, ESPN, HBO, ABC, CBS, CNN, and many local media outlets, as well as in a 2016 documentary titled ``Gleason'', which was heralded at the Sundance Film Festival and premiered across the country with Variety calling the production ``an emotional powerhouse''. The documentary won several awards, including the 2016 Washington, D.C. Area Film Critics Association Award for Best Documentary.
(12) Steve was named one of two Sports Illustrated's Inspirations of the Year in 2014, has been a keynote speaker for Microsoft and at two United Nations sponsored Social Innovation Summits, and received the 2015 George S. Halas Courage Award, given to a NFL player, coach or staff member who overcomes the most adversity to succeed.
(13) Steve helped advocate for the Steve Gleason Act of 2015 (Public Law 114-40; 129 Stat. 441), and the Steve Gleason Enduring Voices Act of 2017, H.R. 2465, 115th Congress (2017), which permanently ensures people living with diseases such ALS have access to speech generating devices regardless of their setting, whether at home or a healthcare institution.
(14) In 2014, Steve and Team Gleason hosted a global summit to bring together researchers, patients, caregivers, and all ALS stakeholders to create a plan to ultimately end ALS. That summit resulted in the single largest coordinated and collaborative ALS research project in the world, Answer ALS, which brings together nearly two dozen research institutions, 1,000 patients and 20,000,000,000,000 data points that are important to the project and that will define the unknown pathways that will lead to treatments or finally a cure.
(15) In 2015, Steve and Microsoft worked together to create a method for people who are completely paralyzed to navigate their power wheelchairs with their eyes. Today, Steve, Microsoft and all wheelchair manufacturers are working collaboratively to make it widely available to all who need this technology. In addition, Microsoft has also made eye tracking technology part of all Windows 10 products across the globe.
(16) In 2011, 10 months after his diagnosis, Steve and Michel made their most significant accomplishment, becoming parents to their son Rivers.
(17) Steve and Michel Gleason continue to fight to find a solution for ALS so they can share many years together and as parents to Rivers.
SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ``Forever GI Bill Housing Payment Fulfillment Act of 2018''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS.
(a) FINDINGS.--Congress finds the following: (1) On August 16, 2017, the Harry W. Colmery Veterans
Educational Assistance Act of 2017 (Public Law 115-48) (known by some as the ``Forever GI Bill'') was enacted into law.
(2) Such Act makes certain improvements to the Post9/11 Educational Assistance program for veterans, including improvements relating to how the Secretary of Veterans Affairs calculates the amount of payments for monthly housing stipends under that program.
(3) Section 107 of such Act (Public Law 115-48; 33 U.S.C. 3313 note) requires the Secretary to calculate the amount of payments for monthly housing stipends based on the location of the campus of the institution of higher learning where the individual attends classes, a change from the previous direction to make such calculation based on the location of the institution of higher learning.
(4) Section 501 of such Act (Public Law 115-48; 37 U.S.C. 403 note) repeals the inapplicability of a modification of the basic allowance for housing for members of the uniformed services to benefits administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs.
(5) The amendments made by section 107 and 501 of such Act became effective on August 1, 2018, and January 1, 2018, respectively.
(6) Representatives of the Department of Veterans Affairs have stated that the Department will not be able to determine proper payment amounts based on the amendment made by section 107 of such Act until December 1, 2019.
(7) Representatives of the Department have also stated that outdated information technology systems have stymied efforts to update necessary information that enable proper

Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017 (Public Law 115-48); and
(3) no individuals entitled to payments of monthly stipend under section 3313 of title 38, United States Code, who have been overpaid as a result of the difficulties encountered by the Department in carrying out such section after the enactment of sections 107 and 501 of such Act should have overpayments recuperated by the Department.

Public Law 115-428 115th Congress

An Act

To improve programs and activities relating to women's entrepreneurship and economic empowerment that are carried out by the United States Agency for International Development, and for other purposes.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ``Women's Entrepreneurship and Economic Empowerment Act of 2018''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds the following: (1) Because women make up the majority of the world's
poor and gender inequalities prevail in incomes, wages, access to finance, ownership of assets, and control over the allocation of resources, women's entrepreneurship and economic empowerment is important to achieve inclusive economic growth at all levels of society.
(2) Research shows that when women exert greater influence over household finances, economic outcomes for families improve, and childhood survival rates, food security, and educational attainment increase. Women also tend to place a greater emphasis on household savings which improves family financial resiliency.
(3) A 2016 report by the McKinsey Global Institute estimated that achieving global gender parity in economic activity could add as much as $28,000,000,000,000 to annual global gross domestic product by 2025.
(4) Lack of access to financial services that address genderspecific constraints impedes women's economic inclusion. Roughly 1,000,000,000 women around the world are currently left out of the formal financial system, which causes many women to rely on informal means of saving and borrowing that are riskier and less reliable.
(5) Among other consequences, this lack of access hampers the success of women entrepreneurs, including women who are seeking to run or grow small and medium-sized enterprises. The International Finance Corporation has estimated that 70 percent of women-owned small and medium-sized enterprises in the formal sector are unserved or underserved in terms of access to financial services, resulting in a financing gap of $300,000,000,000 for women-owned small businesses.
(6) Women's economic empowerment is inextricably linked to a myriad of other women's human rights that are essential

to their ability to thrive as economic actors across the lifecycle, including--
(A) living lives free of violence and exploitation; (B) achieving the highest possible standard of health and well-being; (C) enjoying full legal and human rights, such as access to registration, identification, and citizenship documents; (D) benefitting from formal and informal education; (E) equal protection of and access to land and property rights; (F) access to fundamental labor rights; (G) policies to address disproportionate care burdens; and (H) business and management skills and leadership opportunities. (7) Discriminatory legal and regulatory systems and banking practices are obstacles to women's access to capital and assets, including land, machinery, production facilities, technology, and human resources. These barriers are often connected to a woman's marital status, which can determine whether she is able to inherit land or own property in her name. These constraints contribute to women frequently running smaller businesses, with fewer employees and lower asset values. (8) Savings groups primarily comprised of women are recognized as a vital entry point, especially for poor and very poor women, to formal financial services. There is a high demand for such groups to protect and grow the savings of women with formal financial institutions. (9) Evidence shows that, once a saving group is linked to a bank, the average savings per member increases between 40 to 100 percent and the average profit per member doubles. Investing in financial literacy, business leadership training, and mentorship are key elements to these outcomes. (10) United States support for microenterprise and microfinance development programs, which seek to reduce poverty in low-income countries by giving small loans to small-scale entrepreneurs without collateral, have been a useful mechanism to help families weather economic shocks, but many microcredit borrowers largely remain in poverty. (11) The vast majority of microcredit borrowers are women who would like to move up the economic ladder, but are held back by binding constraints that create a missing middle - large numbers of microenterprises, a handful of large firms or conglomerates, and very few small and medium-sized enterprises in between, which are critical to driving economic growth in developing countries. (12) According to the World Bank, small and mediumsized enterprises create 4 out of 5 new positions in emerging markets, but approximately 50 percent of formal small and medium-sized enterprises lack access to formal credit. The financing gap is even larger when micro and informal enterprises are taken into account. Overall, approximately 70 percent of all micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises in emerging markets lack access to credit.

Combating European Anti-Semitism Act of 2017. 22 USC 6401 note.
22 USC 6412 note.

Public Law 115-434 115th Congress

An Act

To require continued and enhanced annual reporting to Congress in the Annual Report on International Religious Freedom on anti-Semitic incidents in Europe, the safety and security of European Jewish communities, and the efforts of the United States to partner with European governments, the European Union, and civil society groups, to combat anti-Semitism, and for other purposes.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ``Combating European Anti-Semitism Act of 2017''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds the following: (1) During the past decade, there has been a steady
increase in anti-Semitic incidents in Europe, resulting in European Jews being the targets of physical and verbal harassment and even lethal terrorist attacks, all of which has eroded personal and communal security and the quality of daily Jewish life.
(2) According to reporting by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA), between 2005 and 2014, antiSemitic incidents increased in France from 508 to 851; in Germany from 60 to 173; in Belgium from 58 to 130; in Italy from 49 to 86; and in the United Kingdom from 459 to 1,168.
(3) Anti-Zionism has at times devolved into anti-Semitic attacks, prompting condemnation from many European leaders, including French Prime Minister Manuel Valls, British Prime Minister David Cameron, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
(4) Since 2010, the Department of State has adhered to the working definition of Anti-Semitism by the European Monitoring Center on Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC). Some contemporary examples of anti-Semitism include the following:
(A) Calling for, aiding, or justifying the killing or harming of Jews (often in the name of a radical ideology or an extremist view of religion).
(B) Making mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as such, or the power of Jews as a collective, especially, but not exclusively, the myth about a world Jewish conspiracy or of Jews controlling the media, economy, government, or other societal institutions.

PUBLIC LAW 115-434--JAN. 14, 2019

132 STAT. 5527

(C) Accusing Jews as a people of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jewish person or group, the State of Israel, or even for acts committed by non-Jews.
(D) Accusing the Jews as a people, or Israel as a state, of inventing or exaggerating the Holocaust.
(E) Accusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel, or to the alleged priorities of Jews worldwide, than to the interest of their own countries. (5) On October 16, 2004, the President signed into law the Global Anti-Semitism Review Act of 2004. This law provides the legal foundation for a reporting requirement provided by the Department of State annually on anti-Semitism around the world. (6) In November 2015, the House of Representatives passed H. Res. 354 by a vote of 418-0, urging the Secretary of State to continue robust United States reporting on anti-Semitism by the Department of State and the Special Envoy to Combat and Monitor Anti-Semitism. (7) In 2016, the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA), comprised of 31 member countries, adopted a working definition of anti-Semitism which stated: ``Anti-Semitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of anti-Semitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.''. (8) The IHRA further clarified that manifestations of antiSemitism might also target the State of Israel, conceived of as a Jewish collectivity. Anti-Semitism frequently charges Jews with conspiring to harm humanity, and it is often used to blame Jews for ``why things go wrong''. It is expressed in speech, writing, visual forms, and action, and employs sinister stereotypes and negative character traits.
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.
It is the sense of Congress that-- (1) it is in the national interest of the United States to
combat anti-Semitism at home and abroad; (2) anti-Semitism is a challenge to the basic principles
of tolerance, pluralism, and democracy, and the shared values that bind Americans and Europeans together;
(3) there is an urgent need to ensure the safety and security of European Jewish communities, including synagogues, schools, cemeteries, and other institutions;
(4) the United States should continue to emphasize the importance of combating anti-Semitism in multilateral bodies, including the United Nations, European Union institutions, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe;
(5) the Department of State should continue to thoroughly document acts of anti-Semitism and anti-Semitic incitement that occur around the world, and should continue to encourage other countries to do the same, and share their findings; and
(6) the Department of State should continue to work to encourage adoption by national government institutions and

``(G) ANTI-SEMITISM IN EUROPE.--In addition to the information required under clause (vii) of subparagraph (A), with respect to each European country in which verbal or physical threats or attacks are particularly significant against Jewish persons, places of worship, schools, cemeteries, and other religious institutions, a description of--
``(i) the security challenges and needs of European Jewish communities and European law enforcement agencies in such countries to better protect such communities;
``(ii) to the extent practicable, the efforts of the United States Government over the reporting period to partner with European law enforcement agencies and civil society groups regarding the sharing of information and best practices to combat anti-Semitic incidents in Europe;
``(iii) European educational programming and public awareness initiatives that aim to collaborate on educational curricula and campaigns that impart shared values of pluralism and tolerance, and showcase the positive contributions of Jews in culture, scholarship, science, and art, with special attention to those segments of the population that exhibit a high degree of anti-Semitic animus; and
``(iv) efforts by European governments to adopt and apply a working definition of anti-Semitism.''.

Protecting Girls' Access to Education in Vulnerable Settings Act. 22 USC 2151 note. 22 USC 2151c-1 note.

Public Law 115-442 115th Congress

An Act

To enhance the transparency, improve the coordination, and intensify the impact of assistance to support access to primary and secondary education for displaced children and persons, including women and girls, and for other purposes.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Girls' Access to Education in Vulnerable Settings Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
Congress finds the following: (1) As of June 2018, more than 68,000,000 people have
been displaced by disasters and conflicts around the world, the highest number recorded since the end of World War II, of which more than 25,000,000 people are refugees.
(2) More than half of the population of refugees are children and, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, nearly 4,000,000 school-aged refugee children lack access to primary education.
(3) Education offers socioeconomic opportunities, psychological stability, and physical protection for displaced people, particularly for women and girls, who might otherwise be vulnerable to severe forms of trafficking in persons (as such term is defined in section 103(9) of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C. 7102(9)), child marriage, sexual exploitation, or economic disenfranchisement.
(4) Displaced children face considerable barriers to accessing educational services and, because the duration of such displacement is, on average, 26 years, such children may spend the entirety of their childhood without access to such services.
(5) Despite the rising need for educational services, as of 2016, less than two percent of humanitarian aid was directed toward educational services.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.
It is the sense of Congress that-- (1) it is critical to ensure that children, particularly girls,
displaced by conflicts overseas are able to access educational services because such access can combat extremism and reduce exploitation and poverty; and

PUBLIC LAW 115-442--JAN. 14, 2019

132 STAT. 5591

(2) the educational needs of vulnerable women and girls should be considered in the design, implementation, and evaluation of related United States foreign assistance policies and programs.
SEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY.
It is the policy of the United States to-- (1) partner with and encourage other countries, public and
private multilateral institutions, and nongovernmental and civil society organizations, including faith-based organizations and organizations representing parents and children, to support efforts to ensure that displaced children have access to safe primary and secondary education;
(2) work with donors to enhance training and capacitybuilding for the governments of countries hosting significant numbers of displaced people to design, implement, and monitor programs to effectively address barriers to such education; and
(3) coordinate with the governments of countries hosting significant numbers of displaced people to--
(A) promote the inclusion of displaced children into the educational systems of such countries; and
(B) in circumstances in which such inclusion is difficult, develop innovative approaches to providing safe primary and secondary educational opportunities, such as encouraging schools to permit children to be educated by extending the hours of schooling or expanding the number of teachers.
SEC. 5. UNITED STATES ASSISTANCE TO SUPPORT EDUCATIONAL
SERVICES FOR DISPLACED CHILDREN.
(a) IN GENERAL.--The Secretary of State and the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development are authorized to prioritize and advance ongoing efforts to support programs that--
(1) provide safe primary and secondary education for displaced children;
(2) build the capacity of institutions in countries hosting displaced people to prevent discrimination against displaced children, especially displaced girls, who seek access to such education; and
(3) help increase the access of displaced children, especially displaced girls, to educational, economic, and entrepreneurial opportunities, including through the governmental authorities responsible for educational or youth services in such host countries. (b) COORDINATION WITH MULTILATERAL ORGANIZATIONS.--The Secretary and the Administrator are authorized to coordinate with the World Bank, appropriate agencies of the United Nations, and other relevant multilateral organizations to work with governments in other countries to collect relevant data, disaggregated by age and gender, on the ability of displaced people to access education and participate in economic activity, in order to improve the targeting, monitoring, and evaluation of related assistance efforts. (c) COORDINATION WITH PRIVATE SECTOR AND CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS.--The Secretary and the Administrator are authorized to work with private sector and civil society organizations to promote safe primary and secondary education for displaced children.

``(2) Federal statistical agencies should continuously seek to improve their efficiency. Statutory constraints limit the ability of these agencies to share data and thus to achieve higher efficiency for Federal statistical programs.
``(3) The quality of Federal statistics depends on the willingness of businesses to respond to statistical surveys. Reducing reporting burdens will increase response rates, and therefore lead to more accurate characterizations of the economy.
``(4) Enhanced sharing of business data among the Bureau of the Census, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics for exclusively statistical purposes will improve their ability to track more accurately the large and rapidly changing nature of United States business. In particular, the statistical agencies will be able to better ensure that businesses are consistently classified in appropriate industries, resolve data anomalies, produce statistical samples that are consistently adjusted for the entry and exit of new businesses in a timely manner, and correct faulty reporting errors quickly and efficiently.
``(5) Congress enacted the International Investment and Trade in Services Survey Act (Public Law 94-472), which allowed the Bureau of the Census, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics to share data on foreign-owned companies. The Act not only expanded detailed industry coverage from 135 industries to over 800 industries with no increase in the data collected from respondents but also demonstrated how data sharing can result in the creation of valuable data products.
``(6) With part B of this subchapter, the sharing of business data among the Bureau of the Census, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics continues to ensure the highest level of confidentiality for respondents to statistical surveys.

``(a) PURPOSES.--The purposes of this section are the following: ``(1) To authorize the sharing of business data among the
Bureau of the Census, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics for exclusively statistical purposes.
``(2) To reduce the paperwork burdens imposed on businesses that provide requested information to the Federal Government.
``(3) To improve the comparability and accuracy of Federal economic statistics by allowing the Bureau of the Census, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics to update sample frames, develop consistent classifications of establishments and companies into industries, improve coverage, and reconcile significant differences in data produced by the three agencies.
``(4) To increase understanding of the United States economy, especially for key industry and regional statistics, to develop more accurate measures of the impact of technology on productivity growth, and to enhance the reliability of the Nation's most important economic indicators, such as the National Income and Product Accounts.
