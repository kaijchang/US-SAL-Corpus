Decisions of the Supreme Court, on land titles in Arkansas. Under the provision of the act of Congress, passed on the 26th of May, 1824, proceedings were instituted in the superior court of the territory of Arkansas, by which a confirmation was claimed of a grant of land alleged to have been made to the petitioner, Sampeyreac, by the Spanish government, prior to the cession of Louisiana to the United States by the treaty of April 3d, 1803. This claim was opposed by the district attorney of the United States; and the court after hearing evidence, decreed that the petitioner recover the land from the United States. Afterwards, the district attorney of the United States, proceeding on the authority of the act of May 8th, 1830, filed a bill of review, founded on the allegation, that the original decree was obtained by fraud and surprise, that the documents produced in support of the claim of Sampeyreac were forged, and that the witnesses who had been examined to sustain the same were perjured. At a subsequent term Stewart was allowed to become a defendant to the bill of review, and filed an answer, in which the fraud and forgery are denied, and in which he asserts, that ifthe same were committed, he is ignorant thereof; and asserts that he is bona fide purchaser of the land for a valuable consideration, from one John J. Bowie, who conveyed to him the claim of Sampeyreac by deed, dated about the 22d October, 1828. On a final hearing, the court, being satisfied of the forgery, perjury, and fraud, reversed the original decree. Held, that these proceedings were legal, and were authorized by the act of the 8th of May, 1830. Sampeyreac v. The United States, 7 Peters, 222.

intervention of a jury. Mayhew v. Thatcher, 6 Wheat. 129 ; 5 Cond. Rep. 34. By the provisions of the acts of Congress, Louisiana, when she came into the Union, had organized
therein a district court of the United States, having the same jurisdiction, except as to appeals and writs of error, as the circuit courts of the United States in other states; and the modes of proceeding in that court were required to be according to the principles, rules and usages which belong to courts of equity, as contradistinguished from courts of common law. And whether there were or not, in the several states, courts of equity proceeding according to such principles and usages, made no difference, according to the construction uniformly given by the Supreme Court. Livingston v. Story, 9 Peters, 632.
The provisions of the act of Congress of 1824, relative to the practice of the courts of the United States in Louisiana, contain the descriptive term " civil actions," which embrace cases at law and in equity; and may be fairly construed as used in contradistinction to criminal causes.

ing in civil causes in the courts of the United States, that now are, or hereafter may be, established in the state of Louisiana, shall be conformable to the laws directing the mode of practice in the district courts of the said state : Provided, That the judge of any such court of the Uni-

civil causes, to be conformable to the laws directing the mode of prac-

causes, they are adopted by that act, and will govern the practice in the courts of the United States. Ibid.
If there are no equitable claims or rights cognisable in the courts of the state of Louisiana, nor any courts of equity, and no state laws regulating the practice in equity causes, the law of May 26, 1824, ch. 181, does not apply to a case of chancery jurisdiction ; and the district court of Louisiana, was bound to adopt the antecedent modes, authorized under former modes of practice. Ibid.
Under the law of Louisiana, there are two kinds of pledges, the pawn and the antichresis. A thing is said to be pawned, when a movable is given as a security; the antichresis consists of immovables. Livingston v. Story, 11 Peters, 351.
L. conveyed in 1822, in fee simple, to F. and S., certain real estate in New Orleans, by deed, for a sum of money paid to him, and took from them a counter-letter, signed by them; by which it was agreed, that on the payment of a sum stated in it, on a day stated, the property should be reconveyed by them to L.; and if not so paid, the property should be sold by an auctioneer; and, after repaying, out of the proceeds, the sum mentioned in the counter-letter, the balance should be paid to L. The money was not paid on the day appointed, and a further time was given for its payment, with additional interest and charges; and if not paid at the expiration of the time, it should be sold by an auctioneer. An agreement was at the same time made by L., that the counter-letter should be delivered up to F. and S., and cancelled. The money not being paid, it was again agreed between the parties, that if on a subsequent day fixed upon, it should not, with an additional amount for interest, &c., be paid, the property should belong absolutely to F. and S. The money was not paid, and F. and S. afterwards held the property as their own. The Supreme Court held this transaction to be an antichresis, according to the Civil Code of Louisiana; and on a bill filed in the district court of the United States for the eastern district of Louisiana, in 1832, decreed that the rents and profits of the estate should be accounted for by S., who had become the sole owner of the property by purchase of F.'s moiety; and that the property should be sold by an auctioneer, unless the balance due S., after charging the sum due at the time last agreed upon for the payment of the money, and legal interest, with all the expenses of the estate, deducting the rents and profits, should be paid to S.; and on payment of the balance due S., the residue should be paid to the legal representative of L. Ibid.
The antichresis must be reduced to writing. The creditor acquires by this contract, the right of reaping the fruits, or other rewards of the immovables given to him in pledge, on condition of deducting, annually, their proceeds from the interest, if any be due to him, and afterwards from the principal of his debt. The creditor is bound, unless the contrary is agreed on, to pay the taxes, as well as the annual charges of the property given to him in pledge. He is likewise bound, under the penalty of damages, to provide for the keeping and necessary repairs of the pledged estate; and may lay out, from the revenues of the estate, sufficient for such expenses. Ibid.
The creditor does not become proprietor of the pledged immovables, by the failure of payment at the stated time; any clause to the contrary, is null: and in that case, it is only lawful for him to sue his debtor before the court, in order to obtain a sentence against him, and to cause the objects which have been put into his hands, to be seized and sold. Ibid.
The debtor cannot, before the full payment of his debt, claim the enjoyment of the immovables which he has given in pledge ; but the creditor who wishes to free himself from the obligations under the antichresis, may always, unless he has renounced this right, compel the debtor to retake the enjoyment of his immovables. Ibid.
The doctrine of prescription, under the civil law, does not apply to this case, which is one of pledge ; and if it does, the time before the institution of this suit had not elapsed, in which, by the law of Louisiana, a person may sue for immovable property. Ibid.
By the contract of antichresis, the possession of the property is transferred to the person advancing the money. In case of failure to pay, the property is to be sold by judicial process: and the sum which it may bring, over the amount for which it was pledged, is to be paid to the person making the pledge. Ibid.
If any rule has been made by the district court of Louisiana, abolishing chancery practice in that court, it is a violation of those rules which the Supreme Court of the United States has passed to regulate the courts of equity of the United States. Those rules are as obligatory on the courts of the United States in Louisiana, as they are upon all other courts of the United States; and the only modifications or additions which can be made by the circuit or district courts, are such as shall not be inconsistent with the rules prescribed. When the rules prescribed by the Supreme Court do not apply, the practice of the circuit and district courts shall be regulated by the practice of the high court of chancery in England. Story v. Livingston, 13 Peters, 359.
The Supreme Court has said, upon more than one occasion, after mature deliberation upon able arguments of distinguished counsel against it, that the courts of the United States in Louisiana possess equity powers under the constitution and laws of the United States. That if there are any laws in Louisiana, directing the mode of procedure in equity causes, they are adopted by the act of 26th May, 1824, ch. 181, and will govern the practice in the courts of the United States. But if there are no laws regulating the practice in any equity causes, the rules of chancery practice in Louisiana, mean the rules prescribed by the Supreme Court, for the government of the courts of the United States, under the act of Congress of May 8, 1792, ch. 36, sec. 2. Ibid.
No court ought, unless the terms of the act of Congress render it unavoidable, to give a construction to an act, which should, however unintentionally, involve a violation of the Constitution. The terms of the act of 1824 may well be satisfied by limiting its operation to modes of practice and proceedings in the courts below, without changing the effect or conclusiveness of the verdict of a jury upon the facts litigated on the trial. The party may bring the facts into review before the appellate court, so far as they bear

Sec . 2. And be it further enacted, That petit jurors, for the trial of all causes, as well civil as criminal, shall be designated, summoned, and returned in the manner that now is directed by the laws of the said state, with respect to jurors, to serve in the district courts of the said state of Louisiana, and that all the duties directed by such state laws to be performed by the sheriffs and clerks, in relation to the designation, summoning, and returning, such jurors, shall be performed by the marshal of the United States and the clerk of the court of the United States, in the district where such court of the United States shall sit, and that the petit jurors to serve in such court of the United States, shall be taken from the parish in which said court holds its sessions, but, that the grand jurors may come from any part of the district, and may be summoned and empannelled by the marshal, in the manner now prescribed, and the marshal, for the purpose of designating such petit jurors, shall take the names of all persons liable to serve as jurors, from the list made by the sheriff, for the purpose of drawing jurors for the district court of the state; and such number of jurors shall be drawn for each term of such court of the United States, or for such portion of each term, as the court may, by its rules, direct; Provided, That nothing herein contained, shall be so construed as to prevent the judge of any of the said courts of the United States from directing a jury to be summoned from any other parish within the district, whenever it may be necessary to secure an impartial trial; but that, in all such cases, the names of the jury shall be also designated, by lot, in the manner directed by the laws of the state, for designating jurors to serve in the district courts: And provided, also, That special juries may be directed for the trial of any particular civil cause, by the consent of parties, but not otherwise.

upon the question of law, by a bill of exceptions. If there be any mistake of the facts, the court below
is competent to redress it, by giving a new trial. Parsons v. Bedford et al., 3 Peters, 433.
In the district court of Louisiana, the defendant pleaded the plea of reconvention, which is authorized by the Code of Practice in Louisiana. The district court, on motion of the plaintiffs, ordered the plea to be stricken off. The Code of Practice in Louisiana was adopted in Louisiana, by a statute of that state, passed after the act of Congress of May 26, 1824, regulating the practice of the district court of the United States for the eastern district of Louisiana, and the practice according to that code has not been adopted as a part of the rules of practice of the district court, when the plea was stricken off. Held, that the plea was properly stricken off. Wilcox et al. v. Hunt, 13 Peters, 378.
In the case of Livingston v. Story, which was before the court in 1835, (9 Peters, 655,) the court took
occasion to examine the various laws of the United States establishing and organizing the district court of the eastern district of Louisiana, and to decide whether that court had equity powers; and if so, what should be the mode of proceeding in the exercise of those powers. The various cases which had been before the court, involving substantially the same question, in relation to states where there were no equity state courts, or laws regulating the practice in equity causes, were referred to, and the uniform decisions of the court have been, that there being no equity state courts did not prevent the exercise of equity jurisdiction in the courts of the United States; and it was accordingly decided that the district court of Louisiana was bound to proceed in equity causes, according to the principles, rules and usages, which belong to courts of equity as contradistinguished from courts of law. Gaines et al.

It is impossible to lay down any general rule as to what constitutes multifariousness in a bill in equity.

Every case must be governed by its own circumstances, and the court must exercise a sound discretion.

Gaines et ux. v. Relf et al., 2 Howard, 619.
The exercise of chancery jurisdiction, in the courts of Louisiana, does not introduce any new or foreign principle. It is only a change in the mode of redressing wrongs and protecting rights. Ibid.

of the United States to the lots known as the hospital and bake-house United States to lots, containing about three-fourths of an acre of land, in the city of as the hospital Mobile, in the state of Alabama; and also all the right and claim of the and bake-house United States to all the lots not sold or confirmed to individuals, either by lots in the city
Company. A blacksmith's shop was then put on the lot by him, and Lewis, again by proceedings at law, obtained possession of the blacksmith's shop, it not being his improvement. The improvement was first made in 1823. The Spanish governor in 1809, after the Louisiana treaty of 1803, and before the territory west of the Perdido was out of the possession of Spain, granted the lot in front of the lot owned by Forbes and Company, to William Pollard ; but the commissioners ofthe United States, appointed after the territory was in the full possession of the United States, refused to confirm the same "because of the want of improvement and occupation." In 1824, Congress passed an act, the second section of which gives to those who have improved them, the lots in Mobile, known under the Spanish government as " water lots," except where the lot so improved had been alienated, and except lots of which the Spanish government had made " new grants" or orders of survey during the time the Spanish government had "power" to grant the same, in which case the lot is to belong to the alienee or the grantee. In 1836, Congress passed an act for the relief of William Pollard's heirs, by which the lot granted by the Spanish government of 1809, was given to the heirs, saving the right of third persons; and a patent for this lot was issued to the heirs of William Pollard, by the United States, on the 2d July, 1836. Held, that the lot lying east of the lot granted in 1802, by the Spanish government, to Forbes and Company, did not pass by that grant to Forbes and Company; that the act of Congress of 1824, did not vest the title in the lot east of the lot granted in 1802, in Forbes and Company; and that the heirs of Pollard, under the second section of the act of 1824, which excepted from the grant to the city of Mobile, &c., lots held under "new grants"from the Spanish government, and under the act of Congress of 1836, were entitled to the lot granted in 1809 by the Spanish government to William Pollard. Pollard's heirs v. Kibbs, 14 Peters, 353.
The act of Congress under which title was claimed, being a private act, and for the benefit of the city of Mobile, and certain individuals; it is fair to presume it was passed with particular reference to the claims of individuals, and the situation of the land embraced in the law at the time it was passed.
The term " new grant" in its ordinary acceptation, which applied to the same subject or object, is the opposite to " old." But such could not be its meaning in the act of Congress of 1824. The term was doubtless usedin relation to the existing condition of the territory in which such grants were made. The territory had been ceded to the United States by the Louisiana treaty, but in consequence of a dispute with Spain about the boundary line, had remained in the possession of Spain. During this time Spain continued to issue evidences of titles to lands, within the territory in dispute. The term " new" was appropriately used as applicable to grants and orders of survey of this description as contradistinguished from those issued before the cession. Ibid.
The time when the Spanish government had the " power" to grant lands in the territory, by every reasonable intendment of the act of Congress of 1824, must have been so designated with reference to the existing state of the territory, as between the United States and Spain ; the right to the territory being in the United States and the possession in Spain. The language " during the time at which Spain had the power to grant the same," was under such circumstances very appropriately applied to the case. It could with no propriety have been applied to the case, if Spain had full dominion over the territory, by the union of the right and the possession ; and, in this view, it is no forced interpretation of the word " power" to consider it here used as imparting an imperfect right, and distinguished from complete lawful authority. Ibid.
The acts of Congress of March 25, 1812, appointing commissioners to ascertain the titles and claims to lands on the east side of the Mississippi, and west side of the Perdido, and falling within the cession of France, embraced all claims to this description. It extended to all claims, by virtue of any grant, order of survey, or other evidence of claim, whatsoever, derived from the French, British or Spanish governments; and the reports of the commissioners show, that evidence of claims, of various descriptions, issued by Spanish authority, down to 1810, come under their examination. And the legislation of Congress shows many laws passed, confirming incomplete titles, originating after date of the treaty between France and Spain, at St. Ildefonso. Such claims are certainly not beyond the reach of Congress to confirm; although it may require a special act of Congress for that purpose. Such is the act of Congress of July 2d, 1836, which confirms the title of William Pollard's heirs, to the lot which is the subject of this suit. Ibid.
A lot of ground, part of the ground on which fort Charlotte had been erected, in the city of Mobile, before the territory was acquired from Spain, by the United States, had been sold under an act of Congress of 1818. The lot had been laid out according to a plan by which a street, called Water street,was run along the margin of Mobile river; and the street was extended over part of the site of fort Charlotte. The lot was situated west of Water street, but when sold by the United States, its eastern line was between high-water mark of the river. The purchaser of this lot improved the Jot lying in front of it, east of Water street, having filled it up, at a heavy expense, thus reclaiming it from the river, which at high-water had covered it. When the lot east of Water street was purchased, the purchaser could not pass along the street, except with the aid of logs, and other timber. Water street, was, in 1823, filled up, at the cost of the city of Mobile. Taxes and assessments for making side-walks, along Water street, were paid to the city of Mobile, by the owner of the lot. The city of Mobile had brought suit for taxes, and had advertised the lot for sale, as the property of a tenant under the purchaser of the lot. On the 26th of May, 1824, Congress passed an act, which declared in the first section, that all the right and claim of the United States to the lots known as the hospital and bake-house lots, containing about three-fourths of an acre of land in the state of Alabama; and all the right and claim of the United States to all the lots not sold or confirmed to individuals, either by this or any former act, and to which no equitable title exists, in favour of any individual under this or any other act, between high-water mark and the channels of the river, and between Church street and North Boundary street, in front of Mobile, should be vested in the corporation of the city of Mobile for the use of the city forever. The second section provides, " that all the right and claim of the United States to so many

68

of Mobile, &c. vested in the mayor and aldermen of said city.
Right and claim of the United States to other lots in

this or any former act, and to which no equitable title exists, in favour of any individual, under this or any other act, between high-water mark and the channel of the river, and between Church street and North Boundary street, in front of the said city, be, and the same are hereby, vested in the mayor and aldermen of the said city of Mobile, for the time being, and their successors in office, for the sole use and benefit of the said city forever.
Sec . 2. And be it further enacted, That all the right and claim of the United States to so many of the lots of ground, east of Water street, and between Church street and North Boundary street, now

of the lots east of Water street, and between Church street and North Boundary street, now known as water lots, as are situated between the channel of the river and the front of the lots, known under the Spanish government as water lots, in the said city of Mobile wherever improvements have been made, be, and the same are hereby, vested in the several proprietors and occupants of each of the lots heretofore fronting on the river Mobile, &c." The city of Mobile claimed from the defendant in error the lot held by him, under the purchase from the United States, and the improvements before described ; asserting that the same was vested in the city by the first section of the act of 1824. Held, that under the provisions of the second section of the act, the defendant in error claiming under the purchase made under the act of 1818, and under the act of 1824, was entitled to the lot. The city of Mobile v. Eslava, 16 Peters, 261.
The right relinquished by the United States was to the water lots " lying east of Water street, and between Church street and North Boundary street, now known as water lots, as are situated between the channel of the river and the front of the lots, known under the Spanish government as water lots, in the said city of Mobile, wherever improvements have been made." The improvements refer to the water and not to the front lots. A reasonable construction of the act requires, the improvements to have been made or owned by the proprietor of the front lot, at the time of the passage of the act. Being proprietor of the front lot, and having improved the water lot opposite and east of Water street, constitute the conditions on which the right under the statute vests. Ibid.
A grant by the Spanish government confirmed by the United States, was made of a lot of ground in the city of Mobile, running from a certain boundary eastwardly to the river Mobile. The land adjacent to this lot, and extending from high-water mark to the channel of the river, in front of the lot, was held by the grantee as appurtenant to the last and above high-water mark. The city of Mobile instituted an action to recover the same, asserting a title to it under the act of Congress of May 26, 1824, granting certain lots of ground to the corporation of the city of Mobile, and to certain individuals in the said city. Held, that this lot was within the exceptions of the act of 1824 ; and no right to the same was vested in the city of. Mobile by the act. The city of Mobile v. Hallett, 16 Peters, 261.
Ejectment to recover possession of a lot in the city of Mobile, Alabama. The defendants, in the circuit court, claimed title to the land under Lucy Landry, who was the devisee of one Geronio; who having been in possession of the lot at the corner of St. Francis and Royal streets, occupied it until his death. On the arrival of Lucy Landry at age, she occupied the lot as her own property; and in 1818, she sold and conveyed it by deed to certain persons; stating the eastern boundary in the deed to be the Mobile river. These persons, on the same day, conveyed the premises to Oliver Holman, who entered on it and improved it, by erecting houses and a wharf upon it; and continued to occupy it as a merchant in co-partnership with one Charles Brown, who lived in Boston, until December, 1822, when he died ; leaving, as his heirs, the lessors of the plaintiff. The possession of Lucy Landry, of the lot, commenced in 1800, and extended on Royal street, and on the east followed the highwater mark on the river. The land was not subject to inundation, though in many places the water ran across it. Until the improvements made by Holman, the lot was not susceptible of occupancy. There was a ridge of high land formed of shells and artificial deposits, to the east of which, to the river, the lot was situated; and the ridge was protected by the Spanish authorities, no person being permitted by them to improve on the ground or to remove the earth. It was called " The King's Highway," or landing place. Questions as to the title of the proprietors of the adjacent lots above Water street to the lots extending to the river, prevailed until 1824; when on the 26th May, 1824, a law was passed, which granted the lots, known as the water lots under the Spanish government, to the owners of the adjacent grounds. The improvements were made by Holman in 1819 or 1820. The defendants below gave in evidence, to maintain their title, the title to them from Lucy Landry, through her grantees to Oliver Holman : a title bond from Holman to Brown, for half of the lot in controversy, by which a deed was to be executed two years after the date of the bond ; and an act of the legislature of Alabama, passed in December, 1823, after the decease of Holman, authorizing the administratrix of Holman, then residing in Boston, where administration of the estate of the deceased had been granted to her, to sell the real estate of which he died seised, in the city of Mobile, for the payment of his debts, the estate being insolvent: a deed made in pursuance of a sale of the premises, under the act of assembly and in conformity to the provisions thereof; and also the record of certain proceedings in the supreme court of Massachusetts, wherein a license was given to the administratrix to make a deed, in pursuance of the title bond to Brown, and the deed, made under this authority. The questions which arose in the case, and on which the court decided, were : First, whether the act of the legislature of Alabama, authorizing the sale of the estate of Holman, was constitutional and valid. Second, whether the proceedings in the supreme court of Massachusetts were operative, and authorized the administratrix to convey the title. Third, whether a volume of state papers, published under the authority of Congress, was evidence. Fourth, whether the lessors of the plaintiff below had established a legal title. Fifth, whether the defendants in the circuit court had not established a title in themselves, independent of and adverse to the title they had derived under Oliver Holman. The act of Congress of May 26, 1824, relinquished the rights of the United States, whatever they were, in the lot in question, to the proprietor of the front lot. Watkins v. Holman et al., 16 Peters, 25.

ACT OF THE STATE OF VIRGINIA.

An Act incorporating the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company.

Jan. 27, 1824.

Whe rea s a navigable canal from the tide water of the river Potowmac, in

the District of Columbia, to the mouth of Savage creek on the north branch

of said river, and extending thence, across the Alleghany mountain, to some

convenient point on the navigable waters of the river Ohio, or some one of

its tributary streams, to be fed, through its course, on the east side of the

mountain, by the river Potowmac and the streams which empty therein,

and on the western side of the mountain, and in passing over the same, by

all such streams of water as may be beneficially drawn thereto by feeders,

dams, or any other practicable mode, will be a work of great profit and ad-

vantage to the people of this state, and of the neighbouring states, and may,

ultimately, tend to establish a connected navigation between the eastern and

western waters, so as to extend and multiply the means and facilities of in-

ternal commerce and personal intercourse between the two great sections of

the United States, and to interweave more closely all the mutual interests and

affections that are calculated to consolidate and perpetuate the vital principles

of union ; and whereas it is represented to this General Assembly, that the

Potowmac Company are willing and desirous that a charter shall be granted to

a new company, upon the terms and conditions hereinafter expressed ; and

that the charter of the present company shall cease and determine,

United States, shall assent to the provisions of this act, and the Potowmac

company shall have signified their assent to the same, by their corporate act,

a copy whereof shall be delivered to the executives of the several states afore-

said, and to the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States, there shall be

appointed by the said executives and the President of the United States, three

commissioners on the part of each state, and of the government of the United

States, any one of whom shall be competent to act for his respective govern-

and places as they shall think fit, in their respective states, and the District

of Columbia, under the management of such persons as they shall appoint,

for receiving subscriptions to the capital stock of the company hereinafter in-

of attorney ; and notice shall be given in such manner as may be deemed advi-

sable, by one or more of the said commissioners, of the time and places of

opening the books.

2. And the said commissioners shall cause the books to be kept open at least

forty days, and, within twenty days after the expiration thereof, shall call a

general meeting of the subscribers at the city of Washington, of which meeting

notice shall be given, by a majority of the commissioners aforesaid, in at least

And be it enacted, That the presence of stockholders, having a major part of the stock at least, shall be necessary to constitute a general meeting of the stockholders, which shall be held on the first Monday in June in every year, at such convenient town or place as shall be, from time to time, appointed by the said general meeting: but, if a sufficient number shall not attend on that day, the stockholders who do attend, may adjourn from time to time, until the stockholders holding the major part of the stock do attend, and the business of the company is finished; to which meeting the president and directors shall make report, and render distinct accounts of all their proceedings ; and, on finding them fairly and justly stated, the stockholders then present, or a majority of them, shall give a certificate thereof, a duplicate of which shall be entered on the company's books; and at such yearly general meetings, after leaving in the hands of the treasurer such sums as the stockholders, or a majority of them, shall judge necessary for repairs and contingent charges, an equal dividend of all the net profits arising from the tolls hereby granted, shall be ordered and made to and among all the stockholders of the said company, in proportion to their several shares, subject to the provisions and enactments hereinafter declared ; and, upon any emergency in the interval between the said yearly meetings, the said president, or a majority of the said directors, may appoint a general meeting of the stockholders of the company, at any convenient town or place, giving at least one month's previous notice, in at least four of the newspapers in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia; which meeting may be adjourned and continued as aforesaid: and in case the stockholders, or a majority of them, in any general meeting aforesaid, shall deem it expedient to order a semi-annual, rather than a yearly dividend as aforesaid, then, in like manner, with like notice, and under like restrictions, there shall be a half-yearly, or semi-annual dividend of net profits declared and paid.
9. And be it enacted, That, for and in consideration of the expenses the said stockholders will be at, not only in cutting the said canal, erecting locks and dams, providing aqueducts, feeders, and other works, and in improving and keeping the same in repair, the said canal and all other works aforesaid, or required to improve the navigation thereof, at any time hereafter, with all their profits, subject to the limitations herein provided, and to none other, shall be, and the same are hereby, vested in the said stockholders, their heirs and assigns, for ever, as tenants in common, in proportion to their respective shares, and be for ever exempt from the payment of any tax, imposition, or assessment whatsoever; and that it shall and may be lawful for the said president and directors, at all times, for ever hereafter, to demand and receive, at such places as shall hereafter be appointed by the president and directors aforesaid, tolls for the passage of vessels, boats, rafts, produce, and all other articles, at such rates as the said president and directors may hereafter allow and establish, according to the provisions of this act.
10. And be it enacted, That if the commissioners hereby required to be appointed, shall die, resign or refuse to act, the vacancy occasioned thereby shall be filled by the same authority by which the original appointment was made; and the person or persons appointed to fill such vacancy, shall have all the power and authority which was vested in the commissioner whose place he or they shall be appointed to supply ; and when any part of the canal aforesaid shall have been completed, according to the true intent and meaning of this act, the president and directors of the company hereby created, shall have power, and it shall be their duty to ordain and establish a rate of tolls to be paid upon boats, vessels, rafts, or other property, passing on the part of the canal so completed; and so, from time to time, as part or parts shall be completed; and until the eastern section thereof shall be finished up to the mouth of Savage river or creek; and, thereafter, until the entire

APPENDIX I.

797

canal shall have been finished according to the true intent and meaning of this act. For the collection of which tolls, the president and directors shall have power to establish so many toll-houses, and at their pleasure to appoint and remove so many collectors, and at such places as from time to time they may judge expedient; and the said president and directors shall have full authority,
subject to the direction and control of a majority in interest of the stockholders represented in any general meeting, to regulate and fix a tariff of tolls, not exceeding an average of two cents per ton per mile; and so to adjust the said tolls, in relation to the capacity or burden of the boats, and the dimensions of the rafts passing the locks of the said canal, as to promote economy of water and time in the navigation thereof.
11. And be it enacted, That the president and directors shall, annually, or semi-annually, declare and make such dividend of the net profits, from the tolls to be received according to the provisions of this act, and from the other resources of the company, as they may deem advisable, after deducting therefrom the necessary current, and the probable contingent expenses, to be divided among the proprietors of the stock of the said company, in proportion to their respective shares, in manner following; that is to say : if such net profits shall not exceed ten per cent. on the amount of shares, which shall have been paid for in current money of the United States, and expended on the eastern section of the said canal, then the whole thereof shall be divided among the holders of such shares, in proportion to their respective shares ; but, if such net profits shall exceed the rate of ten per cent, per annum in any year, on such amount of stock, then the surplus shall be divided among such stockholders as shall have paid for their shares in certificates of the debts of the Potowmac Company, until they shall therefrom have received a dividend of six per cent.; and, if a surplus yet remain, the same shall be divided among the stockholders who shall have paid for their shares in certificates of the stock of the Potowmac Company, until they shall have received therefrom a dividend of six per cent, per annum on such shares; and if a surplus still remain, so long as the western section of the canal shall remain unfinished, such surplus shall be applied, from time to time, to the construction and completion thereof, in such mode as the president and directors, under such rules and regulations, not inconsistent with the constitution of the United States, or of the several states aforesaid, as the stockholders, or a majority thereof, in general meeting, may prescribe, until the western section of the canal shall be also completed; after which, if such surplus shall still arise, the same shall be divided among all the stockholders, without discrimination, in proportion to their respective shares, until the annual dividend thereon shall have reached fifteen per cent., beyond which it shall never extend. But should the net revenue of the company exceed that amount for any two years in succession, then such excess shall be applied, by the president and directors, in such mode as shall be agreed on by a majority of the stockholders convened in general meeting; first, to strengthening and improving the works of the canal of every description requiring the same; next, to the accommodation, where
not already provided, of the inhabitants of the shores of the river Potowmac, and of the country drained by the tributary streams thereof, now navigable, or which may hereafter become so, by affording to them, in the best practical mode, a safe and easy access to the canal, from the surface of the main river, and of the said streams emptying therein; and, last of all, to the erection of such walls of stone or other materials, along the water margin of the canal, as shall fit the same for the navigation of steamboats of a size adapted to the said canal. And should the said tolls continue, after all such improvements have been completed, to net more than fifteen per cent. per annum to the stockholders for any two years in succession, the tolls upon the same shall be reduced, by the president and directors, according to some just and equitable ratio, till the said dividend shall fall to fifteen per cent, per annum: Provided, That, should the said dividend thereafter sink below fifteen per cent., the said tolls, or a part thereof, may be renewed, till the said net dividend reaches that amount. And for any, or all the within-mentioned purposes, the said president and directors are empowered to borrow, in behalf of the company, on the credit of such excess of tolls, such sum or sums of money as they may deem expedient, at such rate of interest, and with such delay of payment, as they may stipulate, with the previous consent of a majority of the stockholders in general meeting convened.
12. And be itfurther enacted, That it shall be the duty of the president and directors of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company, so long as there shall

time may bear to the whole debt of one hundred and seventy-five thousand eight hundred dollars.
13. And be it further enacted, That whenever the Potowmac Company shall have declared its assent to the provisions of this act, in the manner hereinbefore provided, it shall be lawful for the said company to surrender its charter, and convey, in due form of law, to the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company, hereby incorporated, all the property, rights, and privileges by them owned, possessed and enjoyed, under the same; and thereupon it shall be lawful to and for the said company, hereby proposed to be created, to accept such surrender and transfer, and to hold, possess, use and occupy, all the said property, rights, and privileges, in the same manner, and to the same effect, as the said
Potowmac Company now hold, possess, and occupy the same by law; and thereupon the charter of the said Potowmac Company shall be, and the same is hereby vacated and annulled, and all the rights and powers thereby granted to the Potowmac Company shall be vested in the company hereby incorporated ; and it shall be the duty of the said last mentioned company, until every section of the contemplated canal shall be completed, so as to be used and enjoyed for the purposes of navigation, to keep the corresponding part of the river in a proper state for navigation, and in good order as the same now is; and in default thereof, they shall be in all things responsible, in the same manner as the Potowmac Company is now responsible. And in all rivulets, streams, creeks, and rivers, required for the western section of the said Chesapeake and Ohio canal, the same rights shall be, and are hereby, vested in the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company by this act, as the charter of the Potowmac Company vested in the said company in relation to the waters of the Potowmac and the tributary streams thereof.
14. And be it enacted, That the said canal, and the works to be erected thereon in virtue of this act, when completed, shall forever thereafter be esteemed, and taken to be navigable as a public highway, free for the transportation of all goods, commodities, and produce whatever, on payment of the tolls to be imposed, as provided by this act; and no other toll or tax whatever, for the use of the said canal and the works thereon erected, shall, at any time hereafter, be imposed, but by consent of the said states and of the United States.
15. And whereas it is necessary for the making of the said canal, locks, dams, ponds, feeders, and other works, that a provision should be made for condemning a quantity of land for the purpose : Be it enacted, That it shall and may be lawful for the said president and directors, or a majority of them, to agree with the owners of any land through which the said canal is intended
to pass, for the purchase or use and occupation thereof; and in case of disagreement, or in case the owner thereof shall be a femme covert, under age, non-compos, or out of the state or county, on application to a justice of the county in which such land shall be, the said justice of the peace shall issue his warrant, under his hand, to the sheriff of the county, to summon a jury of eighteen inhabitants of his county, not related to the parties, nor in any manner interested, to meet on the land to be valued at a day to be expressed in the warrant, not less than ten, nor more than twenty days thereafter; and the sheriff, upon receiving the said warrant, shall forthwith summon the said jury, and, when met, shall administer an oath or affirmation to every juryman who shall appear, being not less than twelve in number, that he will faithfully, justly, and impartially, value the land, and all damages the owner thereof shall sustain by cutting the canal through such land, or the partial or temporary appropriation, use, or occupation, of such land, according to the best of his skill and judgment, and that in such valuation he will not spare any person for favour or affection, nor any person grieve for malice, hatred, or ill will; and in every such valuation and assessment of damages, the jury shall be, and they are hereby instructed to consider, in determining and fixing the amount thereof, the actual benefit which will accrue to the owner from conducting the said canal through, or erecting any of the said works upon his land, and to regulate their verdict thereby; except that no assessment shall require any such owner to pay, or contribute any thing to the said company

be signed by the sheriff and some twelve or more of the jury, and returned

by the sheriff to the clerk or prothonotary of his county, and unless good

cause be shown against the said inquisition, it shall be affirmed by the court

and recorded ; but if the said inquisition should be set aside, or if from any

cause no inquisition shall be returned to such court within a reasonable time, the

said court may, at its discretion, as often as may be necessary, direct another

inquisition to be taken in the manner above prescribed; and, upon every such

valuation, the jury is hereby directed to describe and ascertain the bounds of

the land by them valued, and the quality and duration of the interest and

estate in the same, required by the said company for its use; and their valua-

tion shall be conclusive on all persons, and shall be paid for by the said

president and directors to the owner of the land or his legal representatives;

and on payment thereof, the said company shall be seized of such land as of

an absolute estate in perpetuity, or with such less quantity and duration of

interest or estate in the same, or subject to such partial or temporary appro-

priation, use, or occupation, as shall be required and described, as aforesaid,

as if conveyed by the owner to them. And whenever, in the construction of

gravel, or any other material to be found on any of the lands adjacent or near

thereto, and the said president and directors, or their agent, cannot procure the

same for the works aforesaid by private contract of the proprietor or owner, or

in case the owner should be a femme covert, or non-compos, or under age, or

at least four of the newspapers printed in Virginia, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and the District of Columbia, to open books in the before-mentioned states and
district, for receiving and entering such additional subscriptions, in which the stockholders of the said company for the time being, shall, and are hereby declared to have the preference of all others, for the first thirty days after the said books shall be opened as aforesaid, of taking and subscribing for so many
whole shares, as any of them shall choose; and the said president and directors
are hereby required to observe, in all other respects, the same rules, therein, as are by this act prescribed forreceiving and adjusting the first subscriptions, and in like manner to return, under the hands of any three or more of them, an
exact list of such additional subscriptions, with the sums subscribed, to the public authorities, as aforesaid, to be, by them, preserved as aforesaid; and all stockholders of such additional shares shall, and are hereby declared to be, from thenceforward, incorporated into the said company.
19. And be it enacted, That whenever it shall become necessary to subject the lands of any individual to the purposes provided for in this act, and their
consent cannot be obtained, it shall and may be lawful for the company to enter upon such lands, and proceed to the execution of such works, as may be requisite ; and that the pendency of any proceedings in any suit in the nature of a
writ of ad quod damnum, or any other proceedings, shall not hinder or delay the progress of the work; and it shall be the duty of every court to give precedence to controversies which may arise between the company created by this act, and

divided into two sections, to be denominated first and second, or eastern and
western, respectively ; that the first, or eastern section, shall begin at the District of Columbia, on tide-water, and terminate at or near the bank of Savage river, or creek, which empties into the north branch of the Potowmac, at the base of the Alleghany mountain; that the second, or western section, shall
commence at the said termination, and extend along the valley of Savage river, or creek, so far as the same, or any branch thereof, as may reach some conve-
nient point thereon, for connecting the eastern and western waters, by a tunnel through, or an open cut across the dividing ridge between the same; and thence, after crossing the said dividing ridge, shall proceed to the highest steamboat
navigation of the Ohio river, or of some one tributary stream thereof, in such direction as, in the opinion of the said president and directors, shall be best calculated for the attainment of the end set forth in the preamble of this act:
that the said president and directors shall first construct the eastern section
aforesaid, out of the capital stock hereinbefore mentioned, and shall next proceed to construct, with all possible despatch, the western section thereof. In case the said company shall not begin the said work within two years after
the company shall have been formed, or if the work, having been so begun, shall not be diligently prosecuted, so that one hundred miles of the said canal, with the adequate locks and incidental improvements, shall not be completed, and in fit order for navigation, in the term of five years from the commencement of the work, then all interest of the said company, in the navigation and tolls, shall cease and determine, and their charter shall be thereafter taken to be
null and void; and so, in like manner, shall the said charter be null and void,
if the entire eastern section be not completed in the term of twelve years from the said commencement. And should the said company fail to begin the western section of the said canal, in two years after the time allowed as afore-
said for the completion of the eastern section; or, having begun the western section, shall fail to complete the same in six years after such beginning, then all right, title, and interest of the said company, in the said western section,
shall cease and determine; and the several states aforesaid shall have full authority to incorporate another company for the completion of such section, or to complete the same in any other mode that they may deem expedient.
And if, after the completion of the said canal and locks, the president and directors shall fail to keep the same in repair for twelve months at any time, then, in like manner, the interest of the company in the navigation and tolls
shall cease, and their charter shall be forfeited. 21. And be it further enacted, That the right to the waters of the river Po-
towmac, for the purpose of any lateral canal or canals, which the state of Virginia or Maryland may authorize to be made in connection with the said canal, is reserved to the said states respectively ; that a similar right is reserved to the state of Pennsylvania, in relation to the rivers and streams within the ter-

same terms and conditions, and with all the rights, privileges, and powers of every kind whatsoever, that the company incorporated by this act have to make the Chesapeake and Ohio canal. And provided also, That, in taking or extending such lateral canal or canals through the District of Columbia, by either of the said states, no impedimentor injury be done to the navigation of the said Chesapeake and Ohio canal.

Arti cle the 6th -- As it now is.

Arti cle the 12th--As it now is.
When citizens of the United States shall come within the dependencies of Tunis to carry on commerce there, the same respect shall be paid to them which the merchants of other nations enjoy ; and if they wish to establish themselves within our ports, no opposi-

may judge necessary, without any obstruction, in conformity with the usages of other nations; and if a
Tunisian subject shall go to establish himself within the dependencies of the United States, he shall be treated in like manner. If any Tunisian subject shall freight an American vessel, and load her with merchandize, and shall afterwards want to unload, or ship them on

chants, who shall decide upon the case, and, after the decision, the
determination shall be conformed
to. No captain shall be detained in

A Tunisian merchant, who may go to America with a vessel of any nation soever, loaded with merchandize, which is the production of the kingdom of Tunis, shall pay duty (small as it is) like the merchants of other nations; and the American merchants shall equally pay for the merchandize of their country, which they may bring to Tunis, under their flag, the same duty as the Tunisians pay in America. But, if an American merchant, or a merchant of any other nation, shall bring American merchandize, under any other flag, he shall pay six per cent, duty: in like manner, if a foreign merchant shall bring the merchandize of his country, under the American flag, he shall also pay six per cent.
