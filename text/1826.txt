fourth day of January, 1826, between the undersigned, parties to said

western bank of the Chatahoochee river, forty-seven miles below the point

where the boundary line between the Creeks and Cherokees strikes the said

line, and not following the meanders ofthe said river, and from the point of

beginning, running in a direct line to a point in the boundary line between

the said Creeks and the Cherokees, thirty miles west of the said Buz-

zard's Roost, thence to the Buzzard's Roost, and thence with the

middle of said river to the place of beginning." And whereas it having

been represented to the party to the said Treaty in behalf of the Creek

Nation, that a certain extension of said lines might embrace in the ces-

run; and provided, also, that if the said dividing line between Georgia

Made and concluded at the Font du Lac of Lake Superior, this fifth day ofAugust, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight
hundred and twenty-six, between Lewis Cass and Thomas L. McKenney, Commissioners on the part of the United States, and the Chippewa Tribe of Indians. *

Whe re as a Treaty was concluded at Prairie du Chien in August last, by which the war, which has been so long carried on, to their mutual distress, between the Chippewas and Sioux, was happily terminated by the intervention of the United States; and whereas, owing to the remote and dispersed situation of the Chippewas, full deputations of their different bands did not attend at Prairie du Chien, which circumstance, from the loose nature of the Indian government, would render the Treaty of doubtful obligation, with respect to the bands not represented; and whereas, at the request of the Chippewa Chiefs, a stipulation was inserted in the Treaty of Prairie du Chien, by which the United States agreed to assemble the Chippewa Tribe upon Lake Superior during the present year, in order to give full effect to the said Treaty, to explain its stipulations and to call upon the whole Chippewa tribe, assembled at their general council fire, to give their formal assent thereto, that the peace which has been concluded may be rendered permanent, therefore --
ARTICLE 1.

291

ARTICLE 2.
A deputation shall be sent by the Chippewas to the Treaty to be held in 1827, at Green Bay, with full power to arrange and fix the boundary line between the Chippewas and the Winnebagoes and Menomonees, which was left incomplete by the treaty of Prairie du Chien, in consequence of the non-attendance of some of the principal Menomonee Chiefs.
ARTICLE 3.
The Chippewa tribe grant to the government of the United States the right to search for, and carry away, any metals or minerals from any part of their country. But this grant is not to affect the title of the land, nor the existing jurisdiction over it.

A deputation to be sent to Green Bay.
Metals or minerals.

ARTICLE 4.
It being deemed important that the half-breeds, scattered through this extensive country, should be stimulated to exertion and improvement by the possession of permanent property and fixed residences, the Chippewa tribe, in consideration of the affection they bear to these persons, and of the interest which they feel in their welfare, grant to each of the persons described in the schedule hereunto annexed, being half-breeds and Chippewas by descent, and it being understood that the schedule includes all of this description who are attached to the Government of the United States, six hundred and forty acres of land, to be located, under the direction of the President of the United States, upon the islands and shore of the St. Mary's river, wherever good land enough for this purpose can be found; and as soon as such locations are made, the jurisdiction and soil thereof are hereby ceded. It is the intention of the parties, that, where circumstances will permit, the grants be surveyed in the ancient French manner, bounding not less than six arpens, nor more than ten, upon the river, and running back for quantity; and that where this cannot be done, such grants be surveyed in any manner the President may direct. The locations for Oshauguscodaywayqua and her descendents shall be adjoining the lower part of the military reservation, and upon the head of Sugar Island. The persons to whom grants are made shall not have the privilege of conveying the same, without the permission of the President.

Location for the use of the half-breeds.

But this annuity shall continue only during the pleasure of the Congress of the United States.

Annuity of $2000 in money or goods to be paid them.

ARTICLE 6.
With a view to the improvement of the Indian youths, it is also agreed, that an annual sum of one thousand dollars shall be appropriated to the support of an establishment for their education, to be located upon some part of the St. Mary's river, and the money to be expended under the direction of the President; and for the accommodation of such school, a section of land is hereby granted. But the payment of the one thousand dollars stipulated for in this article, is subject to the same limitation described in the preceding article.

Annual payment for the improvement of their children.

292

TREATY WITH THE CHIPPEWAS. 1826.

Rejection of certain articles not to affect the validity of the others.

ARTICLE 7.
The necessity for the stipulations in the fourth, fifth and sixth articles of this treaty could be fully apparent, only from personal observation of the condition, prospects, and wishes of the Chippewas, and the Commissioners were therefore not specifically instructed upon the subjects therein referred to; but seeing the extreme poverty of these wretched people, finding them almost naked and starving, and ascertaining that many perished during the last winter, from hunger and cold, they were induced to insert these articles. But it is expressly understood and agreed, that the fourth, fifth and sixth articles, or either of them, may be rejected by the President and Senate, without affecting the validity of the other articles of the treaty.

Authority of U. S. acknowledged.

ARTICLE 8.
The Chippewa tribe of Indians fully acknowledge the authority and jurisdiction of the United States, and disclaim all connection with any foreign power, solemnly promising to reject any messages, speeches, or councils, incompatible with the interest of the United States, and to communicate information thereof to the proper agent, should any such be delivered or sent to them.

Ratification.

ARTICLE 9.
This treaty, after the same shall be ratified by the President and Senate of the United States, shall be obligatory on the contracting parties.

Done at the Fond du Lac of Lake Superior, in the Territory of Michigan, the day and year above written, and of the Independence of the United States the fifty-first.

all the matters herein providedfor.

Preamble. Ante, p. 237.

Whe rea s a treaty was concluded at the Indian Springs, on the twelfth day of February last, between Commissioners on the part of the United States, and a portion of the Creek Nation, by which an extensive district of country was ceded to the United States.
And whereas a great majority of the Chiefs and Warriors of the said Nation have protested against the execution of the said Treaty,, and have represented that the same was signed on their part by persons having no sufficient authority to form treaties, or to make cessions, and that the stipulations in the said Treaty are, therefore, wholly void.
And whereas the United States are unwilling that difficulties should exist in the said Nation, which may eventually lead to an intestine war, and are still more unwilling that any cessions of land should be made to them, unless with the fair understanding and full assent of the Tribe making such cession, and for a just and adequate consideration, it being the policy of the United States, in all their intercourse with the Indians, to treat them justly and liberally, as becomes the relative situation of the parties.
Now, therefore, in order to remove the difficulties which have thus arisen, to satisfy the great body of the Creek Nation, and to reconcile the contending parties into which it is unhappily divided, the following articles have been agreed upon and concluded, between James Barbour, Secretary of War, specially authorised as aforesaid, and the said Chiefs and Head Men representing the Creek Nation of Indians:

Treaty of Indian Springs declared null and void.

ARTICLE 2.
The Creek Nation of Indians cede to the United States all the land belonging to the said Nation in the State of Georgia, and lying on the east side of the middle of the Chatahoochie river. And, also, another

And the United States agree to purchase for them, if the same can be conveniently done upon reasonable terms, wherever they may select, a country, whose extent shall, in the opinion of the President, be proportioned to their numbers. And if such purchase cannot be thus made, it is then agreed that the selection shall be made where the President may think
proper, just reference being had to the wishes of the emigrating party.

A deputation to examine the Indian country west of the Mississippi, &c.

ARTICLE 7.

Whereas, the southern boundary of the Chippewa country, from the Plover Portage of the Ouisconsin easterly, was left undefined by the treaty concluded at Prairie du Chien, August 19, 1825, in consequence of the non-attendance of some of the principal Menomonie chiefs; and, whereas it was provided by the said treaty, that, whenever the President of the United States might think proper, such of the tribes, parties to the said treaty, as might be interested in any particular line, should be convened, in order to agree upon its establishment;
Therefore, in pursuance of the said provision, it is agreed between the Chippewas, Menomonies and Winebagoes, that the southern boundary of the Chippeway country shall run as follows, namely: From the Plover Portage of the Ouisconsin, on a northeasterly course, to a point on Wolf river, equidistant from the Ashawano and Post lakes of said river, thence to the falls of the Pashaytig river of Green Bay; thence to the junction of the Neesau Kootag or Burnt-wood river, with the Menomonie ; thence to the big island of the Shoskinaubic or Smooth rock river; thence following the channel of the-said river to Green Bay, which it strikes between the little and the great Bay de Noquet.
Art . 2. Much difficulty having arisen from the negociations between the Menomonie and Winebago tribes and the various tribes and portions of tribes of Indians of the State of New York, and the claims of the respective parties being much contested, as well with relation to the tenure and boundaries of the two tracts, claimed by the said New York Indians, west of Lake Michigan, as to the authority of the persons who

Between the United States of America and his Majesty the King of Denmark. (a)
The United States of America and his Majesty the King of Denmark, being desirous to make firm and permanent the peace and friendship which happily prevail between the two nations, and to extend the commercial relations which subsist between their respective territories and People, have agreed to fix, in a manner clear and positive, the rules which shall in future be observed between the one and the other party, by means of a General Convention of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation. With that object, the President of the United States of America has conferred full powers on Henry Clay, their Secretary of State, and his Majesty the King of Denmark has conferred like powers on Peter Pedersen, his Privy Counsellor of Legation, and Minister resident near the said States, Knight of the Dannebrog, who, after having exchanged their said full powers, found to be in due and proper form, have agreed to the following articles:

Commerce and navigation.

ARTICLE 1. The contracting parties, desiring to live in peace and harmony with all the other nations of the earth, by means of a policy frank and equally friendly with all, engage, mutually, not to grant any particular favour to other nations, in respect of commerce and navigation, which shall not immediately become common to the other party, who shall enjoy the same freely, if the concession were freely made, or on allowing the same compensation, if the concession were conditional.

Navigation, equality, and reciprocity. Produce and manufactures.

ARTICLE 2. The contracting parties being likewise desirous of placing the Commerce and Navigation of their respective countries on the liberal basis of perfect equality and reciprocity, mutually agree that the citizens and subjects of each may frequent all the coasts and countries of the other, (with the exception hereafter provided for in the sixth article,) and reside and trade there in all kinds of produce, manufactures, and merchandize ; and they shall enjoy all the rights, privileges, and exemptions, in navigation and commerce, which native citizens or subjects do, or shall enjoy, submitting themselves to the laws, decrees, and usages, there established, to which native citizens or subjects are subjected. But it is understood that this article does not include the coasting trade of either country, the regulation of which is reserved by the parties, respectively, according to their own separate laws.
ARTICLE 3. They, likewise, agree that whatever kind of produce, manufacture, or merchandize, of any foreign country, can be, from time to time, lawfully imported into the United States, in vessels belonging wholly to the citi-

zens thereof, may be also imported in vessels wholly belonging to the subjects of Denmark; and that no higher or other duties upon the tonnage of the vessel or her cargo shall be levied and collected, whether the importation be made in vessels of the one country or of the other. And, in like manner, that whatever kind of produce, manufacture, or merchandize, of any foreign country, can be, from time to time, lawfully imported into the dominions of the King of Denmark, in the vessels thereof, (with the exception hereafter mentioned in the sixth article,) may be also imported in vessels of the United States; and that no higher or other duties upon the tonnage of the vessel or her cargo shall be levied and collected, whether the importation be made in vessels of the one country or of the other. And they further agree, that whatever may be lawfully exported or re-exported, from the one country in its own vessels, to any foreign country, may, in like manner, be exported or re-exported in the vessels of the other country. And the same bounties, duties, and drawbacks, shall be allowed and collected, whether
such exportation or re-exportation be made in vessels of the United States or of Denmark. Nor shall higher or other charges of any kind be imposed, in the ports of one party, on vessels of the other, than are, or shall be, payable in the same ports by native vessels.

ARTICLE 4.
No higher or other duties shall be imposed on the importation into the United States of any article, the produce or manufacture of the dominions of his Majesty the King of Denmark; and no higher or other duties shall be imposed on the importation into the said dominions of any article, the produce or manufacture of the United States, than are, or shall be, payable on the like articles, being the produce or manufacture of any other foreign country. Nor shall any higher or other duties or charges be imposed in either of the two countries, on the exportation of any articles to the United States, or to the dominions of his Majesty the King of Denmark, respectively, than such as are, or may be, payable on the exportation of the like articles to any other foreign country. Nor shall any prohibition be imposed on the exportation or importation of any articles, the produce or manufacture of the United States, or of the dominions of his Majesty the King of Denmark, to, or from, the territories of the United States, or to or from the said dominions, which shall not equally extend to all other nations.
ARTICLE 5.
Neither the vessels of the United States nor their cargoes shall, when they pass the Sound or the Belts, pay higher or other duties than those which are or may be paid by the most favoured nation.
ARTICLE 6.
The present Convention shall not apply to the Northern possessions of his Majesty the King of Denmark; that is to say, Iceland, the Ferroe Islands, and Greenland, nor to places situated beyond the Cape of Good Hope, the right to regulate the direct intercourse with which possessions and places is reserved by the parties respectively. And it is further agreed that this Convention is not to extend to the direct trade between Denmark and the West India Colonies of his Danish Majesty, but in the intercourse with those Colonies, it is agreed that whatever can be lawfully imported into or exported from the said Colonies in vessels of one party from or to the ports of the United States, or from or to the ports of any other foreign country, may, in like manner, and with the same duties and charges, applicable to vessel and cargo, be imported into or exported from the said Colonies in vessels of the other party.

Addendum.

Dep ar tm en t of State ,
Washington, April 25, 1826.

The undersigned, Secretary of State of the United States, by direc-

tion of the President thereof, has the honour to state to Mr. Pedersen,

Minister resident of his Majesty the King of Denmark, that it would

have been satisfactory to the Government of the United States, if Mr.

Pedersen had been charged with instructions in the negotiation which

has just terminated, to treat of the indemnities to citizens of the United

States, in consequence of the seizure, detention, and condemnation of their property, in the ports of his Danish Majesty. But as he has no

instructions to that effect, the undersigned is directed, at and before

proceeding to the signature of the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce,

and Navigation, on which they have agreed, explicitly to declare, that

the omission to provide for those indemnities, is not hereafter to be in-

terpreted as a waiver or abandonment of them by the Government of the

United States, which, on the contrary, is firmly resolved to persevere in

the pursuit of them, until they shall be finally arranged, upon principles

of equity and justice. And, to guard against any misconception of the

fact of the silence of the Treaty, in the above particular, or of the views

of the American Government, the undersigned requests that Mr. Peder-

sen will transmit this official declaration to the Government of Denmark.

And he avails himself of this occasion to tender to Mr. Pedersen assu-

rances of his distinguished consideration.

Denmark, not being waived on the part of the United States, by the

Convention agreed upon, and about to be signed, which note he, as re-
