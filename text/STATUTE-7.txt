INDIAN TREATIES .

THE editor of this work has considered it obligatory upon him to exhibit, as preliminary matter to the treaties between the United States and the

Indian tribes, the general principles which have been recognised by the Supreme Court of the United States in relation to the Indian tribes, the Indian title to the lands occupied by them, and the effect of treaties with them upon their claims to these lands, or the claims of others under Indian

grants. In the case of Johnson and Graham's Lessee v. William M'Intosh, 8

Wheaton's Reports, 543 ; 5 Condensed Reports, 515 , Mr. Chief Justice

Marshall, who delivered the opinion of the Court, said :

The plaintiffs in this cause claim the land, in their declaration mentioned, under two grants, purporting to be made, the first in 1773, and the

last in 1775, by the chiefs of certain Indian tribes, constituting the Illinois and the Piankeshaw nations ; and the question is, whether this title can be recognised in the courts of the United States ?

The facts, as stated in the case agreed, show the authority of the chiefs

who executed this conveyance, so far as it could be given by their own people ; and likewise show, that the particular tribes for whom these chiefs acted were in rightful possession of the land they sold . The inquiry, therefore, is, in a great measure, confined to the power of Indians to give, and of private individuals to receive, a title which can be sustained in the courts of this country.

As the right of society, to prescribe those rules by which property may be acquired and preserved, is not and cannot be drawn into question ; as the title to lands, especially, is and must be admitted to depend entirely on the law of the nation in which they lie ; it will be necessary, in pursuing this inquiry, to examine, not singly those principles of abstract justice, which the Creator of all things has impressed on the mind of his creature man, and which are admitted to regulate, in a great degree, the rights of civilized nations, whose perfect independence is acknowledged ; but those principles also which our own government has adopted in the particular case, and given us as the rule for our decision.

On the discovery of this immense continent, the great nations of Europe were eager to appropriate to themselves so much of it as they could respectively acquire. Its vast extent offered an ample field to the ambi-

tion and enterprise of all ; and the character and religion of its inhabitants

afforded an apology for considering them as a people over whom the superior genius of Europe might claim an ascendency. The potentates of the old world found no difficulty in convincing themselves that they made

ample compensation to the inhabitants of the new, by bestowing on them civilization and Christianity, in exchange for unlimited independence.

But, as they were all in pursuit of nearly the same object, it was necessary, in order to avoid conflicting settlements, and consequent war with

each other, to establish a principle, which all should acknowledge as the

law by which the right of acquisition , which they all asserted, should be regulated as between themselves . This principle was, that discovery

gave title to the government by whose subjects, or by whose authority, it

was made, against all other European governments, which title might be consummated by possession.

INDIAN TREATIES.

The exclusion of all other Europeans, necessarily gave to the nation making the discovery the sole right of acquiring the soil from the natives, and establishing settlements upon it. It was a right with which no Europeans could interfere. It was a right which all asserted for themselves, and to the assertion of which, by others, all assented.
Those relations which were to exist between the discoverer and the
natives, were to be regulated by themselves. The rights thus acquired being exclusive, no other power could interpose between them .
In the establishment of these relations, the rights of the original inhabitants were, in no instance, entirely disregarded ; but were necessarily, to a considerable extent, impaired. They were admitted to be the rightful occupants of the soil, with a legal as well as just claim to retain possession of it, and to use it according to their own discretion ; but their rights to complete sovereignty, as independent nations, were necessarily diminished, and their power to dispose of the soil at their own will, to whomsoever
they pleased, was denied by the original fundamental principle, that discovery gave exclusive title to those who made it.
While the different nations of Europe respected the right of the natives, as occupants, they asserted the ultimate right to be in themselves ; and claimed and exercised, as a consequence of this ultimate dominion, a power to grant the soil, while yet in possession of the natives. These grants have been understood by all to convey a title to the grantees, subject only to the Indian right of occupancy.
The history of America, from its discovery to the present day, proves, we think, the universal recognition of these principles.
Spain did not rest her title solely on the grant of the pope . Her discussions respecting boundary, with France, with Great Britain, and with the United States, all show that she placed it on the rights given by discovery. Portugal sustained her claim to the Brazils by the same title.
France, also, founded her title to the vast territories she claimed in America on discovery. However conciliatory her conduct to the natives may have been, she still asserted her right of dominion over a great extent of country not actually settled by Frenchmen, and her exclusive right to acquire and dispose of the soil which remained in the occupation of Indians. Her monarch claimed all Canada and Acadie, as colonies of
France, at a time when the French population was very inconsiderable, and the Indians occupied almost the whole country. He also claimed Louisiana, comprehending the immense territories watered by the Mississippi, and the rivers which empty into it, by the title of discovery. The letters patent granted to the Sieur Demonts, in 1603, constitute him
lieutenant-general, and the representative of the king in Acadie, which is described as stretching from the 40th to the 46th degree of north latitude ; with authority to extend the power of the French over that country, and its inhabitants ; to give laws to the people, to treat with the natives, and enforce the observance of treaties ; and to parcel out and give title to lands, according to his own judgment.
The states of Holland also made acquisitions in America, and sustained their right on the common principle adopted by all Europe. They allege, as we are told by Smith, in his history of New York, that Henry Hudson, who sailed, as they say, under the orders of their East India Company, discovered the country from the Delaware to the Hudson, up which he sailed to the 43d degree of north latitude ; and this country they claimed under the title acquired by this voyage. Their first object was commercial, as appears by a grant made to a company of merchants in 1614 ; but in 1621 , the states-general made, as we are told by Mr. Smith, a grant of the country to the West India Company, by the name of New Netherlands.
The claim of the Dutch was always contested by the English ; not because they questioned the title given by discovery, but because they insisted on being themselves the rightful claimants under that title. Their pretensions were finally decided by the sword.

INDIAN TREATIES.

No one of the powers of Europe gave its full assent to this principle more unequivocally than England. The documents upon this subject are ample and complete. So early as the year 1496, her monarch granted a commission to the Cabots to discover countries then unknown to Christian
people, and to take possession of them in the name of the king of England. Two years afterwards, Cabot proceeded on this voyage, and discovered the continent of North America, along which he sailed as far south as Virginia. To this discovery the English trace their title.
In this first effort made by the English government to acquire territory on this continent, we perceive a complete recognition of the principle which has been mentioned. The right of discovery given by this commission is confined to countries "then unknown to all Christian people ; " and of those countries Cabot was empowered to take possession in the name of the king of England. Thus asserting a right to take possession notwithstanding the occupancy of the natives, who were heathens, and, at the same time, admitting the prior title of any Christian people who may have made a previous discovery.
The same principle continued to be recognised. The charter granted to Sir Humphrey Gilbert, in 1578, authorizes him to discover and take possession of such remote, heathen, and barbarous lands as were not actually possessed by any Christian prince or people. This charter was afterwards renewed to Sir Walter Raleigh, in nearly the same terms.
By the charter of 1606, under which the first permanent English settlement on this continent was made, James I. granted to sir Thomas Gates and others, those territories in America lying on the sea-coast, between the 34th and 45th degrees of north latitude, and which either belonged to that monarch, or were not then possessed by any other Christian prince or people. The grantees were divided into two companies at their own request. The first, or southern colony, was directed to settle between the 34th and 41st degrees of north latitude ; and the second, or northern colony, between the 38th and 45th degrees.
In 1609, after some expensive and not very successful attempts at settlement had been made, a new and more enlarged charter was given by the crown to the first colony, in which the king granted to the Treasurer and Company of Adventurers of the city of London for the first colony in Virginia," in absolute property, the lands extending along the sea-coast four hundred miles, and into the land throughout from sea to sea. This charter, which is a part of the special verdict in this cause, was annulled, so far as respected the rights of the company, by the judgment of the court of king's bench on a writ of quo warranto ; but the whole effect allowed to this judgment was, to revest in the crown the powers of government, and the title to the lands within its limits.
At the solicitation of those who held under the grant to the second or northern colony, a new and more enlarged charter was granted to the duke of Lenox and others, in 1620, who were denominated the Plymouth Company, conveying to them in absolute property all the lands between the 40th and 48th degrees of north latitude.
Under this patent, New England has been in a great measure settled. The company conveyed to Henry Rosewell and others, in 1627, that territory which is now Massachusetts ; and in 1628, a charter of incorporation, comprehending the powers of government, was granted to the purchasers .
Great part of New England was granted by this company, which, at length, divided their remaining lands among themselves ; and, in 1635, surrendered their charter to the crown. A patent was granted to Gorges for Maine, which was allotted to him in the division of property.
All the grants made by the Plymouth Company, so far as we can learn, have been respected. In pursuance of the same principle, the king, in 1664, granted to the duke of York the country of New England as far

INDIAN TREATIES.
south as the Delaware bay. His royal highness transferred New Jersey to lord Berkeley and sir George Carteret.
In 1663, the crown granted to lord Clarendon and others, the country lying between the thirty-sixth degree of north latitude and the river St. Mathes ; and, in 1666, the proprietors obtained from the crown a new charter, granting to them that province in the king's dominions in North America which lies from thirty-six degrees thirty minutes north latitude to the twenty-ninth degree, and from the Atlantic ocean to the South sea. Thus has our whole country been granted by the crown while in the occupation of the Indians. These grants purport to convey the soil as well as the right of dominion to the grantees. In those governments which were denominated royal, where the right to the soil was not vested in individuals, but remained in the crown, or was vested in the colonial government, the king claimed and exercised the right of granting lands, and of dismembering the government at his will. The grants made out of the two original colonies, after the resumption of their charters by the crown, are examples of this. The governments of New England, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and a part of Carolina, were thus created. In all of them, the soil, at the time the grants were made,
was occupied by the Indians. Yet almost every title within those governments is dependent on these grants. In some instances, the soil was conveyed by the crown unaccompanied by the powers of government, as in the case of the northern neck of Virginia. It has never been objected to this, or to any other similar grant, that the title as well as possession was in the Indians when it was made, and that it passed nothing on that account.
These various patents cannot be considered as nullities ; nor can they be limited to a mere grant of the powers of government. A charter intended to convey political power only, would never contain words expressly granting the land, the soil and the waters. Some of them purport to convey the soil alone ; and in those cases in which the powers of government,
as well as the soil, are conveyed to individuals, the crown has always acknowledged itself to be bound by the grant. Though the power to dismember regal governments was asserted and exercised, the power to dismember proprietary governments was not claimed ; and, in some instances, even after the powers of government were revested in the crown, the title of the proprietors to the soil was respected .
Charles II. was extremely anxious to acquire the property of Maine, but the grantees sold it to Massachusetts, and he did not venture to contest the right of that colony to the soil. The Carolinas were originally proprietary governments. In 1721 a revolution was effected by the people, who shook off their obedience to the proprietors, and declared their dependence immediately on the crown. The king, however, purchased the title of those who were disposed to sell. One of them, lord Carteret, surrendered his interest in the government, but retained his title to the soil. That title was respected till the revolution, when it was forfeited by the laws of war.
Further proofs of the extent to which this principle has been recognised, will be found in the history of the wars, negotiations and treaties, which the different nations, claiming territory in America, have carried on, and held with each other.
The contests between the cabinets of Versailles and Madrid, respecting the territory on the northern coast of the gulf of Mexico, were fierce and bloody and continued , until the establishment of a Bourbon on the throne of Spain produced such amicable dispositions in the two crowns, as to suspend or terminate them.
Between France and Great Britain, whose discoveries as well as settlements were nearly contemporaneous, contests for the country actually covered by the Indians, began as soon as their settlements approached

INDIAN TREATIES.
each other, and were continued until finally settled in the year 1763, by the treaty of Paris.
Each nation had granted and partially settled the country, denominated by the French, Acadie, and by the English, Nova Scotia. By the twelfth article of the treaty of Utrecht, made in 1703, his most Christian majesty ceded to the Queen of Great Britain, " all Nova Scotia or Acadie, with its ancient boundaries." A great part of the ceded territory was in the possession of the Indians, and the extent of the cession could not be adjusted by the commissioners to whom it was to be referred .
The treaty of Aix la Chapelle, which was made on the principle of the status ante bellum, did not remove this subject of controversy. Commissioners for its adjustment were appointed, whose very able and elaborate, though unsuccessful arguments, in favour of the title of their respective sovereigns, show how entirely each relied on the title given by discovery to lands remaining in the possession of Indians.
After the termination of this fruitless discussion, the subject was transferred to Europe, and taken up by the cabinets of Versailles and London. This controversy embraced not only the boundaries of New England, Nova Scotia, and that part of Canada which adjoined those colonies, but embraced our whole western country also. France contended not only that the St. Lawrence was to be considered as the centre of Canada, but that the Ohio was within that colony. She founded this claim on discovery, and on having used that river for the transportation of troops, in a war with some southern Indians.
This river was comprehended in the chartered limits of Virginia ; but, though the right of England to a reasonable extent of country, in virtue of her discovery of the seacoast, and of the settlements she made on it, was not to be questioned ; her claim of all the lands to the Pacific ocean, because she had discovered the country washed by the Atlantic, might, without derogating from the principle recognised by all, be deemed extravagant. It interfered, too, with the claims of France, founded on the
same principle. She therefore sought to strengthen her original title to the lands in controversy, by insisting that it had been acknowledged by France in the fifteenth article of the treaty of Utrecht. The dispute respecting the construction of that article, has no tendency to impair the principle, that discovery gave a title to lands still remaining in the possession of the Indians. Whichever title prevailed, it was still a title to lands occupied by the Indians, whose right of occupancy neither controverted , and neither had then extinguished.
These conflicting claims produced a long and bloody war, which was terminated by the conquest of the whole country east of the Mississippi. In the treaty of 1763, France ceded and guarantied to Great Britain, all Nova Scotia or Acadie, and Canada, with their dependencies ; and it was agreed, that the boundaries between the territories of the two nations, in America, should be irrevocably fixed by a line drawn from the source of the Mississippi, through the middle of that river and the lakes Maurepas and Ponchartrain, to the sea. This treaty expressly cedes, and has always been understood to cede, the whole country, on the English side of the dividing line, between the two nations, although a great and valuable part of it was occupied by the Indians. Great Britain, on her part, surrendered
to France all her pretensions to the country west of the Mississippi. It has never been supposed that she surrendered nothing, although she was not in actual possession of a foot of land. She surrendered all right to acquire the country ; and any after attempt to purchase it from the Indians, would have been considered and treated as an invasion of the territories of France.
By the 20th article of the same treaty, Spain ceded Florida, with its dependencies, and all the countries she claimed east or south-east of the Mississippi, to Great Britain. Great part of this territory also was in possession of the Indians.
A2

INDIAN TREATIES.
By a secret treaty, which was executed about the same time, France ceded Louisiana to Spain ; and Spain has since retroceded the same country to France . At the time both of its cession and retrocession, it was occupied, chiefly, by the Indians.
Thus, all the nations of Europe, who have acquired territory on this continent, have asserted in themselves, and have recognised in others, the exclusive right of the discoverer to appropriate the lands occupied by the Indians. Have the American States rejected or adopted this principle ?
By the treaty which concluded the war of our revolution, Great Britain relinquished all claim, not only to the government, but to the " propriety and territorial rights of the United States," whose boundaries were fixed in the second article . By this treaty the powers of government, and the right to soil, which had previously been in Great Britain, passed definitively to these states. We had before taken possession of them, by declaring independence ; but neither the declaration of independence, nor the treaty confirming it, could give us more than that which we before possessed, or to which Great Britain was before entitled. It has never been doubted, that either the United States, or the several states, had a clear title to all the lands within the boundary lines described in the treaty, subject only to the Indian right of occupancy, and that the exclusive power to extinguish that right, was vested in that government which might constitutionally exercise it.
Virginia, particularly within those chartered limits the land in controversy lay, passed an act, in the year 1779, declaring her " exclusive right of pre-emption from the Indians, of all the lands within the limits of her
own chartered territory, and that no person or persons whatsoever, have, or ever had, a right to purchase any lands within the same, from any Indian nation, except only persons duly authorized to make such purchase ; formerly for the use and benefit of the colony, and lately for the commonwealth." The act then proceeds to annul all deeds made by Indians to individuals, for the private use of the purchasers.
Without ascribing to this act the power of annulling vested rights , or admitting it to countervail the testimony furnished by the marginal note opposite to the title of the law, forbidding purchases from the Indians, in the revisals of the Virginia statutes, stating that law to be repealed, it may safely be considered as an unequivocal affirmance, on the part of Virginia, of the broad principle which had always been maintained, that the exclusive right to purchase from the Indians resided in the government.
In pursuance of the same idea, Virginia proceeded, at the same session, to open her land office for the sale of that country which now constitutes Kentucky, a country every acre of which was then claimed and possessed by Indians, who maintained their title with as much persevering courage as was ever manifested by any people.
The states, having within their chartered limits different portions of territory covered by Indians, ceded that territory, generally, to the United States, on conditions expressed in their deeds of cession, which demonstrate the opinion, that they ceded the soil as well as jurisdiction, and that in doing so, they granted a productive fund to the government of the union. The lands in controversy lay within the chartered limits of Virginia, and were ceded with the whole country north-west of the river Ohio. This grant contained reservations and stipulations, which could only be made by the owners of the soil ; and concluded with a stipulation , that " all the lands in the ceded territory, not reserved, should be considered as a common fund, for the use and benefit of such of the United States as have become, or shall become members of the confederation," &c., " according to their usual respective proportions in the general charge and expenditure, and shall be faithfully and bona fide disposed of for that purpose, and for no other use or purpose whatsoever."
The ceded territory was occupied by numerous and warlike tribes of

INDIAN TREATIES.

7

Indians ; but the exclusive right of the United States to extinguish their title, and to grant the soil, has never, we believe, been doubted.
After these states became independent, a controversy subsisted between them and Spain respecting boundary. By the treaty of 1795, this controversy was adjusted, and Spain ceded to the United States the territory in question. This territory, though claimed by both nations, was chiefly in the actual occupation of Indians.
The magnificent purchase of Louisiana, was the purchase from France of a country almost entirely occupied by numerous tribes of Indians, who are in fact independent. Yet, any attempt of others to intrude into that country, would be considered as an aggression which would justify war.
Our late acquisitions from Spain are of the same character, and the negotiations which preceded those acquisitions, recognise and elucidate the principle which has been received as the foundation of all European title in America.
The United States, then, have unequivocally acceded to that great and broad rule by which its civilized inhabitants now hold this country. They
hold, and assert in themselves, the title by which it was acquired. They maintain, as all others have maintained, that discovery gave an exclusive right to extinguish the Indian title of occupancy, either by purchase or
by conquest ; and gave also a right to such a degree of sovereignty as the circumstances of the people would allow them to exercise.
The power now possessed by the government of the United States to grant lands, resided, while we were colonies, in the crown, or its grantees. The validity of the titles given by either has never been questioned in our courts. It has been exercised uniformly over territory in possession of the Indians. The existence of this power must negative the existence of any right which may conflict with, and control it. An absolute title to lands cannot exist, at the same time, in different persons, or in different governments. An absolute, must be an exclusive title, or at least a title which excludes all others not compatible with it. All our institutions recognise the absolute title of the crown, subject only to the Indian right of occupancy, and recognise the absolute title of the crown to extinguish that right. This is incompatible with an absolute and complete title in the Indians.
We will not enter into the controversy, whether agriculturists, merchants, and manufacturers, have a right, on abstract principles, to expel hunters from the territory they possess, or to contract their limits. Conquest gives a title which the courts of the conqueror cannot deny, whatever the private and speculative opinions of individuals may be, respecting the original justice of the claim which has been successfully asserted . The British government, which was then our government, and whose rights have passed to the United States, asserted a title to all the lands occupied by Indians, within the chartered limits of the British colonies.
It asserted also a limited sovereignty over them, and the exclusive right of extinguishing the title which occupancy gave to them. These claims have been maintained and established as far west as the river Mississippi,
by the sword. The title to a vast portion of the lands we now hold, originates in them. It is not for the courts of this country to question the validity of this title, or to sustain one which is incompatible with it.
Although we do not mean to engage in the defence of those principles which Europeans have applied to Indian title, they may, we think, find some excuse, if not justification, in the character and habits of the people whose rights have been wrested from them.
The title by conquest is acquired and maintained by force. The conqueror prescribes its limits. Humanity, however, acting on public opinion, has established, as a general rule, that the conquered shall not be wantonly oppressed, and that their condition shall remain as eligible as is compatible with the objects of the conquest. Most usually, they are incorporated with the victorious nation, and become subjects or citizens of the govern-

8

ment with which they are connected . The new and old members of the society mingle with each other; the distinction between them is gradually lost, and they make one people. Where this incorporation is practicable, humanity demands, and a wise policy requires, that the rights of the conquered to property should remain unimpaired ; that the new subjects should be governed as equitably as the old, and that confidence in their security should gradually banish the painful sense of being separated from their ancient connexions, and united by force to strangers.
When the conquest is complete, and the conquered inhabitants can be blended with the conquerors, or safely governed as a distinct people, public opinion, which not even the conqueror can disregard, imposes these restraints upon him ; and he cannot neglect them without injury to his fame, and hazard to his power.
But the tribes of Indians inhabiting this country were fierce savages, whose occupation was war, and whose subsistence was drawn chiefly from the forest. To leave them in possession of their country, was to leave the country a wilderness ; to govern them as a distinct people, was impossible, because they were as brave and as high-spirited as they were fierce, and were ready to repel by arms every attempt on their independence.
What was the inevitable consequence of this state of things ? The Europeans were under the necessity either of abandoning the country, and relinquishing their pompous claims to it, or of enforcing those claims
by the sword, and by the adoption of principles adapted to the condition of a people with whom it was impossible to mix, and who could not be governed as a distinct society, or of remaining in their neighbourhood, and exposing themselves and their families to the perpetual hazard of being massacred.
Frequent and bloody wars, in which the whites were not always the aggressors, unavoidably ensued. European policy, numbers, and skill, prevailed. As the white population advanced, that of the Indians necessarily receded. The country in the immediate neighbourhood of agriculturists became unfit for them. The game fled into thicker and more unbroken forests, and the Indians followed. The soil, to which the crown originally claimed title, being no longer occupied by its ancient inhabitants, was parcelled out according to the will of the sovereign power, and taken possession of by persons who claimed immediately from the crown, or mediately, through its grantees or deputies.
That law which regulates, and ought to regulate in general, the relations between the conqueror and conquered, was incapable of application to a people under such circumstances. The resort to some new and different rule, better adapted to the actual state of things, was unavoidable. Every rule which can be suggested will be found to be attended with great difficulty.
However extravagant the pretension of converting the discovery of an inhabited country into conquest may appear ; if the principle has been asserted in the first instance, and afterwards sustained ; if a country has
been acquired and held under it ; if the property of the great mass ofthe community originates in it, it becomes the law of the land, and cannot be questioned. So, too, with respect to the concomitant principle, that the Indian inhabitants are to be considered merely as occupants, to be pro-
tected, indeed, while in peace, in the possession of their lands, but to be incapable of transferring the absolute title to others. However this restriction may be opposed to natural right, and to the usages of civilized nations, yet, if it be indispensable to that system under which the country has been settled, and be adapted to the actual condition of the two people,
it may, perhaps, be supported by reason, and certainly cannot be rejected by courts of justice.

It was doubted whether a state can be seised in fee of lands subject to the Indian title, and whether a decision that they were seised in fee, might

INDIAN TREATIES .

9

not be construed to amount to a decision that their grantee might maintain an ejectment for them, notwithstanding that title. The majority of the court is of opinion that the nature of the Indian title, which is certainly to be respected by all courts until it be legitimately extinguished, is not such as to be absolutely repugnant to a seisin in fee on the part of the state. Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch, 87 ; 2 Cond. Rep. 308.
The act of the 30th of March, 1802, having described what should be considered as the Indian country at that time, as well as at any future time
when purchases of territory should be made of the Indians ; the carrying of spirituous liquors into a territory so purchased, after March, 1802, although the same should be at the time frequented and inhabited exclusively by Indians ; would not be an offence within the meaning of the beforementioned acts of congress, so as to subject the goods of the trader, found in company with those liquors, to seizure and forfeiture. American Fur Company v. The United States, 2 Peters, 368.
The condition of the Indians, in relation to the United States, is perhaps unlike that of any other two people in existence. In general, nations not owing a common allegiance, are foreign to each other. The term foreign nation, is with strict propriety applicable by either to the other. But the relation of the Indians to the United States, is marked by peculiar and cardinal distinctions , which exist nowhere else. The Cherokee Nation v. The State of Georgia, 5 Peters, 1 .
The Indians are acknowledged to have an unquestionable, and heretofore an unquestioned right to the lands they occupy, until that right shall be extinguished by a voluntary cession to the government. It may well be doubted, whether those tribes which reside within the acknowledged boundaries of the United States, can with strict accuracy be denominated foreign nations. They may more correctly, perhaps, be denominated domestic dependent nations. They occupy a territory to which we assert a title, independent of their will, which must take effect in point of possession, when their right of possession ceases ; meanwhile they are in a state of pupilage. Their relations to the United States resemble that of a
ward to his guardian. They look to our government for protection ; rely upon its kindness and its power ; appeal to it for relief to their wants ; and address the President as their great father. Ibid.
The treaties and laws of the United States, contemplate the Indian territory as completely separated from that of the states ; and provide that all intercourse with them shall be carried on exclusively by the government of the Union. Worcester v. The State of Georgia, 6 Peters, 515.
The Indian nations had always been considered as distinct, independent political communities, retaining their original natural rights, as the undisputed possessors of the soil, from time immemorial ; with the single exception of that imposed by irresistible power, which excluded them from intercourse with any other European potentate, than the first discoverer of the coast of the particular region claimed : and this was a restriction which those European potentates imposed on themselves, as well as on the Indians. The very term " nation," so generally applied to them, means " a people distinct from others." The constitution, by declaring treaties already made, as well as those to be made, to be the supreme law of the land, has adopted and sanctioned the previous treaties with the In-
dian nations, and, consequently, admits their rank among those powers who are capable of making treaties. The words " treaty" and " nation" are words of our own language, selected in our diplomatic and legislative proceedings, by ourselves ; having each a definite and well-understood meaning. We have applied them to Indians, as we have applied the.m
to other nations of the earth. They are applied to all in the same sense. Ibid.
One uniform rule seems to have prevailed in the British provinces in America, by which Indian lands were held and sold, from their first settlement, as appears by their laws ; that friendly Indians were protected in

the possession of the lands they occupied, and were considered as owning them by a perpetual right of possession in the tribe or nation inhabiting them, as their common property, from generation to generation, not as the right of the individuals located on particular spots. Subject to this right of possession, the ultimate fee was in the crown, and its grantees ; which could be granted by the crown or colonial legislatures, while the lands remained in possession of the Indians ; though possession could not be taken without their consent. United States v. Clark, 9 Peters, 168.
Individuals could not purchase Indian lands without permission or license from the crown, colonial governors, or according to the rules prescribed by colonial laws ; but such purchases were valid with such license, or in conformity with the local laws : and by this union of the perpetual right of occupancy with the ultimate fee, which passed from the crown by the license, the title of the purchaser became complete. Ibid.
Indian possession or occupation was considered with reference to their habits and modes of life ; their hunting-grounds were as much in their actual possession, as the cleared fields of the whites ; and their rights to its exclusive enjoyment in their own way, and for their own purposes, were as much respected, until they abandoned them, made a cession to the government, or an authorized sale to individuals. In either case their rights became extinct, the lands could be granted disencumbered of the right of occupancy, or enjoyed in full dominion by the purchasers from the Indians. Such was the tenure of Indian lands by the laws of Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia. Ibid.
Grants made by the Indians at public councils, since the treaty at Fort Stanwick's, have been made directly to the purchasers, or to the state in which the land lies, in trust for them, or with directions to convey to
them ; of which there are many instances of large tracts so sold and held ; especially in New York. Ibid.
It was an universal rule, that purchases made at Indian treaties, in the presence, and with the approbation of the officer under whose direction they were held by the authority of the crown, gave a valid title to the lands ; it prevailed under the laws of the states after the revolution, and yet continues in those where the right to the ultimate fee is owned by the states, or their grantees . It has been adopted by the United States, and purchases made at treaties held by their authority, have been always held
good by the ratification of the treaty, without any patent to the purchasers from the United States. This rule in the colonies was founded on a settled rule of the law of England, that by his prerogative, the king was the universal occupant of all vacant lands in his dominions, and had the right to grant them at his pleasure, or by his authorized officers . Ibid.
When the United States acquired and took possession of the Floridas, the treaties which had been made with the Indian tribes, before the acqui-
sition of the territory by Spain and Great Britain, remained in force over all the ceded territory, as the laws which regulated the relations with all the Indians who were parties to them, and were binding on the United States, by the obligation they had assumed by the Louisiana treaty, as a supreme law of the land, which was inviolable by the power of congress They were also binding as the fundamental law of Indian rights ; acknow ledged by royal orders, and municipal regulations of the province, as the laws and ordinances of Spain in the ceded provinces, which were declared to continue in force by the proclamation of the governor in taking possession of the provinces ; and by the acts of congress , which assured all the inhabitants of protection in their property. It would be an unwarranted construction of these treaties, laws, ordinances and municipal regulations, to decide that the Indians were not to be maintained in the enjoyment of
all the rights which they could have enjoyed under either, had the provinces remained under the dominion of Spain . It would be rather a

INDIAN TREATIES.

11

perversion of their spirit, meaning and terms, contrary to the injunction of the law under which the court acts, which makes the stipulations of
any treaty, the laws and ordinances of Spain, and these acts of congress, so far as either apply to this case, the standard rules for its decision. Ibid.
The treaties with Spain and England , before the acquisition of Florida by the United States, which guarantied to the Seminole Indians their lands according to the right of property with which they possessed them, were adopted by the United States ; who thus became the protectors of all the rights they had previously enjoyed, or could of right enjoy under Great Britain or Spain, as individuals or nations, by any treaty, to which the United States thus became parties in 1803. Ibid.
The Indian right to the lands as property, was not merely of possession, that of alienation was concomitant ; both were equally secured, protected and guarantied by Great Britain and Spain, subject only to ratification and confirmation by the license, charter or deed from the governor representing the king. Such purchases enabled the Indians to pay their debts, compensate for their depredations on the traders resident among them to provide for their wants ; while they were available to the purchasers as payment of the considerations which at their expense had been received by the Indians. It would have been a violation of the faith of the government to both, to encourage traders to settle in the province, to put themselves and property in the power of the Indians, to suffer the latter to contract debts, and when willing to pay them by the only means in their power, a cession of their lands, withhold an assent to the purchase, which, by their laws or municipal regulations, was necessary to vest a title. Such a course was never adopted by Great Britain , in any of her colonies, nor by Spain in Louisiana or Florida. Ibid.
The laws made it necessary, when the Indians sold their lands, to have the deeds presented to the governor for confirmation. The sales by the Indians transferred the kind of right which they possessed ; the ratification of the sale by the governor, must be regarded as a relinquishment of the title of the crown to the purchaser ; and no instance is known where permission to sell has been " refused, or the rejection of an Indian sale." Ibid.
The colonial charters, a great portion of the individual grants by the proprietary and royal governments, and a still greater portion by the states of the Union after the revolution, were made for lands within the Indian
hunting-grounds. North Carolina and Virginia to a great extent paid their officers and soldiers of the revolutionary war by such grants, and extinguished the arrears due the army by similar means. It was one of
the great resources which sustained the war, not only by those states, but by other states. The ultimate fee, encumbered with the right of Indian occupancy, was in the crown previous to the revolution , and in the states of the Union afterwards, and subject to grant. This right of occupancy was protected by the political power, and respected by the courts, until extinguished, when the patentee took the encumbered fee. So the
supreme court and the state courts have uniformly held . Clark v . Smith, 13 Peters, 195.

NOTE. It is clearly understood by the parties to this treaty, that the annuity stipulated in the sixth article, is to be applied to the benefit of such of the Six Nations and of their Indian friends united with them as aforesaid , as do or shall reside within the boundaries of the United States : For the United States do not interfere with nations, tribes or families, of Indians elsewhere resident.

ARTICLE V.

Indians have

To prevent any misunderstanding about the Indian lands relinquished

lraignhdts troelhiun-nt on by the United States in the fourth article, it is now explicitly declared,

quished by U.S. that the meaning of that relinquishment is this : The Indian tribes who

& c.

have a right to those lands, are quietly to enjoy them, hunting, planting,

and dwelling thereon so long as they please, without any molestation

from the United States ; but when those tribes, or any of them, shall be

disposed to sell their lands, or any part of them, they are to be sold

only to the United States ; and untill such sale , the United States will

protect all the said Indian tribes in the quiet enjoyment of their lands

against all citizens of the United States, and against all other white

persons who intrude upon the same. And the said Indian tribes again

acknowledge themselves to be under the protection of the said United

States and no other power whatever.

Indians may
expel settlers from their lands.

ARTICLE VI.
If any citizen of the United States, or any other white person or persons, shall presume to settle upon the lands now relinquished by the United States, such citizen or other person shall be out of the protection of the United States ; and the Indian tribe, on whose land the settlement shall be made, may drive off the settler, or punish him in such manner as they shall think fit ; and because such settlements made without the consent of the United States, will be injurious to them as well as to the Indians, the United States shall be at liberty to break them up, and remove and punish the settlers as they shall think proper , and so effect that protection of the Indian lands herein before stipulated.

Indians may hunt on lands ceded to U. S.

ARTICLE VII.
The said tribes of Indians , parties to this treaty, shall be at liberty to hunt within the territory and lands which they have now ceded to the United States, without hindrance or molestation , so long as they demean themselves peaceably, and offer no injury to the people of the United States.
ARTICLE VIII.

Trade to be
opened with the Indians.

Trade shall be opened with the said Indian tribes ; and they do hereby respectively engage to afford protection to such persons, with their property, as shall be duly licensed to reside among them for the purpose of trade, and to their agents and servants ; but no person shall be per-

mitted to reside at any of their towns or hunting camps as a trader, who

is not furnished with a license for that purpose, under the hand and

seal of the superintendant of the department north-west of the Ohio, or such other person as the President of the United States shall authorise

to grant such licences ; to the end, that the said Indians may not be imposed on in their trade. And if any licensed trader shall abuse his

privilege by unfair dealing, upon complaint and proof thereof, his licence

shall be taken from him, and he shall be further punished according to the laws of the United States. And if any person shall intrude himself

as a trader, without such license, the said Indians shall take and bring

him before the superintendant or his deputy, to be dealt with according

to law. And to prevent impositions by forged licences, the said Indians shall at least once a year give information to the superintendant or his

deputies, of the names of the traders residing among them.

Retaliation restrained.

ARTICLE IX .

TREATY WITH THE WYANDOTS, ETC. 1795.

53

no private revenge or retaliation shall take place ; but instead thereof,

complaint shall be made by the party injured , to the other : By the said Indian tribes, or any of them, to the President of the United States, or

the superintendant by him appointed ; and by the superintendant or other person appointed by the President, to the principal chiefs of the said Indian tribes, or of the tribe to which the offender belongs ; and such prudent measures shall then be pursued as shall be necessary to

preserve the said peace and friendship unbroken , until the Legislature

(or Great Council ) of the United States, shall make other equitable provision in the case, to the satisfaction of both parties. Should any Indian tribes meditate a war against the United States or either of them, and the same shall come to the knowledge of the before-mentioned

Indians to give notice of designs against U.S.

tribes, or either of them, they do hereby engage to give immediate notice thereof to the general or officer commanding the troops of the United States, at the nearest post. And should any tribe, with hostile

intentions against the United States, or either of them, attempt to pass

through their country, they will endeavour to prevent the same, and in like manner give information of such attempt, to the general or officer commanding, as soon as possible, that all causes of mistrust and suspicion may be avoided between them and the United States. In like manner the United States shall give notice to the said Indian tribes of

any harm that may be meditated against them, or either of them, that

shall come to their knowledge ; and do all in their power to hinder and prevent the same, that the friendship between them may be uninterrupted.

ARTICLE X.

All other treaties heretofore made between the United States and the
said Indian tribes, or any of them, since the treaty of 1783, between the United States and Great Britain, that come within the purview of this treaty, shall henceforth cease and become void.

Former treaties void.

A TREATY

Between the United States of America and the Delaware tribe of Indians.
THE Delaware tribe of Indians finding that the annuity which they receive from the United States, is not sufficient to supply them with the articles which are necessary for their comfort and convenience, and afford the means of introducing amongst them the arts of civilised life, and being convinced that the extensiveness of the country they possess, by giving an opportunity to their hunting parties to ramble to a great distance from their towns, is the principal means of retarding this desirable event ; and the United States being desirous to connect their settlements on the Wabash with the state of Kentucky : therefore the said United States, by William Henry Harrison , governor of the Indiana territory, superintendent of Indian affairs, and their commissioner plenipotentiary for treating with the Indian tribes northwest of the Ohio river ; and the said tribe of Indians, by their sachems, chiefs, and head warriors, have agreed to the following articles, which when ratified by the President of the United States, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall be binding on the said parties.

Aug. 18, 1804.
Proclamation , Feb. 14, 1805.
Ratified Jan. 21 , 1805.

ARTICLE 1. The said Delaware tribe, for the considerations hereinafter mentioned , relinquishes to the United States forever, all their right and title to the tract of country which lies between the Ohio and Wabash rivers, and below the tract ceded by the treaty of Fort Wayne, and the road leading from Vincennes to the falls of Ohio.

Cession to the United States.

ART. 2. The said tribe shall receive from the United States for ten Additional anyears, an additional annuity of three hundred dollars, which is to be annuity to be exclusively appropriated to the purpose of ameliorating their condition plaaiwdarteost. he Deand promoting their civilization . Suitable persons shall be employed at Provision for the expence of the United States to teach them to make fences, culti- teaching them vate the earth, and such of the domestic arts as are adapted to their dagormiecsutltiucraalrtas,nd situation ; and a further sum of three hundred dollars shall be appro- &c. priated annually for five years to this object. The United States will
cause to be delivered to them in the course of the next spring, horses fit for draft, cattle, hogs and implements of husbandry to the amount
of four hundred dollars. The preceding stipulations together with goods Preceding sti to the amount of eight hundred dollars which is now delivered to the ptuolbaeticoonnss,ih-ow said tribe, ( a part of which is to be appropriated to the satisfying certain dered. individuals of the said tribe, whose horses have been taken by white
11

82

TREATY WITH THE DELAWARES . 1804.

people) is to be considered as full compensation for the relinquishment made in the first article.

Stolen horses to be restored.

ART. 3. As there is great reason to believe that there are now in the possession of the said tribe, several horses which have been stolen from citizens of the United States, the chiefs who represent the said tribe are to use their utmost endeavors to have the said horses forthwith de-
livered to the superintendent of Indian affairs or such persons as he may appoint to receive them. And as the United States can place the
utmost reliance on the honour and integrity of those chiefs who have manifested a punctilious regard to the engagements entered into at the treaty of Grenville, it is agreed that in relation to such of the horses stolen as aforesaid, but which have died or been removed beyond the reach of the chiefs, the United States will compensate the owners for the loss of them without deducting from the annuity of the said tribe the amount of what may be paid in this way. But it is expressly understood that this provision is not to extend to any horses which have been stolen within the course of twelve months preceding the date hereof.

Right of the Delawares to
lands, & c.

ART. 4. The said tribe having exhibited to the above-named commissioner of the United States sufficient proof of their right to all the country which lies between the Ohio and White river, and the Miami tribe who were the original proprietors of the upper part of that country having explicitly acknowledged the title of the Delawares at the general council held at Fort Wayne in the month of June 1803, the said United States will in future consider the Delawares as the rightful owners of all the country which is bounded by the white river on the north, the Ohio on the south, the general boundary line running from the mouth of the Kentucky river on the east, and the tract ceded by this treaty, and that ceded by the treaty of Fort Wayne, on the west and south west.

Stipulation that the U. S. will treat with the Piankeshaws for an acknow-
ledgment of the title of the De-
lawares, & c.

ART. 5. As the Piankishaw tribe have hitherto obstinately persisted in refusing to recognize the title of the Delawares to the tract of country ceded by this treaty, the United States will negociate with them and will endeavor to settle the matter, in an amicable way ; but should they reject the propositions that may be made to them on this subject, and should the United States not think proper to take possession of the said country without their consent ; the stipulations and promises herein made on behalf of the United States, shall be null and void.

Boundaries, & c.

ART. 6. As the road from Vincennes to Clark's grant will form a
very inconvenient boundery, and as it is the intention of the parties to these presents that the whole of the said road shall be within the tract ceded to the United States, it is agreed that the boundary in that quar-
ter shall be a straight line to be drawn parallel to the course of the said road from the eastern boundary of the tracts ceded by the treaty of Fort Wayne to Clark's grant ; but the said line is not to pass at a greater distance than half a mile from the most northerly bend of said road.

In witness whereof the commissioner plenipotentiary of the United States, and the chiefs and head men of the said tribe have hereunto set their hands, and affixed their seals. Done at Vincennes the
eighteenth day of August, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and four ; and of the independence of the United States, the twenty-ninth.

ARTICLES of a treaty made and entered into, at Grouseland , near Vincennes, in the Indiana territory, by and between William Henry Harrison, governor of said territory, superintendant of Indian affairs, and commissioner plenipotentiary of the United States, for treating with the north western tribes of Indians, of the one part, and the tribes of Indians called the Delewares, Putawatimis, Miamis, Eel River, and Weas, jointly and severally by their chiefs and head men, of the other part.

And whereas, the Miami tribes, from whom the Delawares
derived their claim, contend that in their cession of said tract to the Delewares, it was never their intention to convey to them the right of the soil, but to suffer them to occupy it as long as they thought proper, the said Delewares have, for the sake of peace and good neighbourhood, determined to relinquish their claim to the said tract, and do by these presents release the United States from the guarantee made in the before-mentioned article of the treaty of August, eighteen hundred and four.

dollars, for ten years, and no longer ; which, together with the sum of four thousand dollars which is now delivered , the receipt whereof they do hereby acknowledge, is to be considered as a full compensation for the land now ceded.

ART. IV. As the tribes which are now called the Miamis , Eel River, and Weas, were formerly and still consider themselves as one nation, and as they have determined that neither of these tribes shall dispose of any part of the country which they hold in common ; in order to
quiet their minds on that head , the United States do hereby engage to (91 )

lee or Black Fox, the king or head chief of said Cherokee nation , acting on the part of, and in behalf of said nation, is one, that the eastern limits of said ceded tract shall be bounded by a line so to be run from the upper end of the Chickasaw Old Fields, a little above the upper point of an island , called Chickasaw Island , as will most directly intersect the first waters of Elk river, thence carried to the Great Cumberland mountain , in which the waters of Elk river have their source, then along the margin of said mountain untill it shall intersect lands heretofore ceded to the United States, at the said Tennessee ridge. And in consideration of the readiness shown by the Cherokees to explain, and to place the limits of the land ceded by the said convention out of all doubt ; and in consideration of their expenses in attending council, the executive of the United States will direct that the Cherokee nation shall receive the sum of two thousand dollars, to be paid to them by their agent, at such time as the said executive shall direct, and that the Cherokee hunters, as hath been the custom in such cases, may hunt on said ceded tract, untill by the fullness of settlers it shall become improper. And it is hereby declared by the parties, that this explanation ought to be considered as a just elucidation of the cession made by the first article of said convention.

DONE at the point of departure of the line at the upper end of the
island, opposite to the upper part of the said Chickasaw Old Fields,
the eleventh day of September, in the year one thousand eight hundred and seven.

Chisholm and James Rogers, duly authorized by the chiefs of the Cherokees on the Arkansas river, in open council, by written power of
attorney, duly signed and executed, in presence of Joseph Sevier and William Ware.

Preamble.

WHEREAS in the autumn of the year one thousand eight hundred and eight, a deputation from the Upper and Lower Cherokee towns, duly authorized by their nation , went on to the city of Washington, the first named to declare to the President of the United States their anxious
desire to engage in the pursuits of agriculture and civilized life , in the country they then occupied, and to make known to the President of the
United States the impracticability of inducing the nation at large to do this, and to request the establishment of a division line between the upper and lower towns, so as to include all the waters of the Hiwassee river to the upper town, that, by thus contracting their society within narrow limits, they proposed to begin the establishment of fixed laws and a regular government : The deputies from the lower towns to make known their desire to continue the hunter life, and also the scarcity of game where they then lived , and, under those circumstances, their wish to remove across the Mississippi river, on some vacant lands of the United States. And whereas the President of the United States, after maturely considering the petitions of both parties, on the ninth day of January, A. D. one thousand eight hundred and nine, including other subjects, answered those petitions as follows : " The United States, my children , are the friends of both parties, and, as far as can be reasonably asked , they are willing to satisfy the wishes of both. Those who remain may be assured of our patronage, our aid, and good neighborhood. Those who wish to remove, are permitted to send an exploring party to reconnoitre the country on the waters of the Arkansas and White rivers, and the higher up the better, as they will be the longer unapproached by our settlements, which will begin at the mouths of those rivers. The regular districts of the government of St. Louis are already laid off to the St. Francis.
"When this party shall have found a tract of country suiting the emigrants, and not claimed by other Indians, we will arrange with them and you the exchange of that for a just portion of the country they leave, and to a part ofwhich, proportioned to their numbers, they have a right. Every aid towards their removal, and what will be necessary for them

there, will then be freely administered to them ; and when established in their new settlements, we shall still consider them as our children , give them the benefit of exchanging their peltries for what they will want at our factories , and always hold them firmly by the hand."
And whereas the Cherokees, relying on the promises of the President of the United States, as above recited , did explore the country on the west side of the Mississippi, and made choice of the country on the Arkansas and White rivers, and settled themselves down upon United States' lands, to which no other tribe of Indians have any just claim , and have duly notified the President of the United States thereof, and of their anxious desire for the full and complete ratification of his promise, and, to that end, as notified by the President of the United States, have sent on their agents, with full powers to execute a treaty, relinquishing to the United States all the right, title, and interest, to all lands of right to them belonging, as part of the Cherokee nation , which they have left, and which they are about to leave, proportioned to their numbers, including, with those now on the Arkansas, those who are about to remove thither, and to a portion of which they have an equal right agreeably to their numbers.

In order, therefore, to promote peace among these tribes, and to establish boundaries among them and the other tribes who live in their vicinity , and thereby to remove all causes of future difficulty , the United States have invited the Chippewa, Sac, and Fox, Menominie, Ioway, Sioux, Winnebago, and a portion of the Ottowa, Chippewa , and Potawatomie Tribes of Indians living upon the Illinois, to assemble together, and in a spirit of mutual conciliation to accomplish these objects ; and to aid therein , have appointed William Clark and Lewis Cass, Commissioners on their part, who have met the Chiefs, Warriors, and Representatives of the said tribes, and portion of tribes, at Prairie des Chiens, in the Territory of Michigan, and after full deliberation , the said tribes , and portions of tribes, have agreed with the United States, and with one another, upon the following articles :

Firm and perpetual peace.

ARTICLE 1 .
There shall be a firm and perpetual peace between the Sioux and Chippewas ; between the Sioux and the confederated tribes of Sacs and Foxes ; and between the Ioways and the Sioux.

ARTICLE 2.

Line between
the respective countries .

It is agreed between the confederated Tribes of the Sacs and Foxes, and the Sioux, that the Line between their respective countries shall be as follows : Commencing at the mouth of the Upper Ioway River, on the west bank of the Mississippi, and ascending the said Ioway river, to its left fork ; thence up that fork to its source ; thence crossing the fork of Red Cedar River, in a direct line to the second or upper fork of the Desmoines river ; and thence in a direct line to the lower fork of the Calumet river ; and down that river to its juncture with the Missouri river. But the Yancton band of the Sioux tribe, being princi-
pally interested in the establishment of the line from the Forks of the Desmoines to the Missouri , and not being sufficiently represented to render the definitive establishment of that line proper, it is expressly declared that the line from the forks of the Desmoines to the forks of
the Calumet river, and down that river to the Missouri, is not to be considered as settled until the assent of the Yancton band shall be given thereto. And if the said band should refuse their assent, the arrange-

ment of that portion of the boundary line shall be void , and the rights

of the parties to the country bounded thereby, shall be the same as if

no provision had been made for the extension of the line west of the forks of the Desmoines. And the Sacs and Foxes relinquish to the

tribes interested therein , all their claim to land on the east side of the

Mississippi river.

ARTICLE 3.

Relinquish-
ment of Sacs and Foxes.

The Ioways accede to the arrangement between the Sacs and Foxes, and the Sioux ; but it is agreed between the Ioways and the confederated tribes of the Sacs and Foxes, that the Ioways have a just claim to a portion of the country between the boundary line described in the next preceding article, and the Missouri and Mississippi ; and that the said Ioways, and Sacs and Foxes, shall peaceably occupy the same, until some satisfactory arrangement can be made between them for a division of their respective claims to country.

Iowas accede tmoetnhte. arrange-

ARTICLE 4.

The Ottoes not being represented at this Council , and the Commissioners for the United States being anxious that justice should be done
to all parties, and having reason to believe that the Ottoes have a just claim to a portion of the country upon the Missouri, east and south of the boundary line dividing the Sacs and Foxes and the Ioways, from the Sioux, it is agreed between the parties interested therein , and the United States, that the claim of the Ottoes shall not be affected by any thing herein contained ; but the same shall remain as valid as if this treaty had not been formed.

to Red Cedar River, immediately below the Falls ; from thence to the St. Croix River, which it strikes at a place called the standing cedar, about a day's paddle in a canoe, above the Lake at the mouth of that
river ; thence passing between two lakes called by the Chippewas "Green Lakes," and bythe Sioux " the lakes they bury the Eagles in," and from thence to the standing cedar, that " the Sioux Split ;" thence to Rum River, crossing it at the mouth of a small creek called choaking creek, a long day's march from the Mississippi ; thence to a point of woods that projects into the prairie, half a day's march from the Mississippi ; thence in a straight line to the mouth of the first river which enters the Mississippi on its west side above the mouth of Sac river ;
thence ascending the said river ( above the mouth of Sac river) to a small lake at its source ; thence in a direct line to a lake at the head of Prairie river, which is supposed to enter the Crow Wing river on its South side ; thence to Otter-tail lake Portage ; thence to said Otter-tail lake, and down through the middle thereof, to its outlet ; thence in a direct line, so as to strike Buffalo river , half way from its source to its mouth, and down the said river to Red River ; thence descending Red river to the mouth of Outard or Goose creek : The eastern boundary of the Sioux commences opposite the mouth of Ioway river, on the Mississippi, runs back two or three miles to the bluffs , follows the bluffs crossing Bad axe river , to the mouth of Black river, and from Black
river to half a day's march below the Falls of the Chippewa River.

ARTICLE 6.

It is agreed between the Chippewas and Winnebagoes, so far as they are mutually interested therein, that the southern boundary line of the Chippewa country shall commence on the Chippewa river aforesaid ,

half a day's march below the falls of that river, and run thence to the source of Clear Water river, a branch of the Chippewa ; thence south to Black River ; thence to a point where the woods project into the medows, and thence to the Plover Portage of the Ouisconsin.

ARTICLE 7.

Agreement be-
tween the Winnebagoes and the Sioux, & c.

It is agreed between the Winnebagoes and the Sioux, Sacs and Foxes, Chippewas and Ottawas, Chippewas and Potawatomies of the Illinois, that the Winnebago country shall be bounded as follows : south easterly by Rock River, from its source near the Winnebago lake, to the Winnebago village, about forty miles above its mouth ; westerly by the east line of the tract, lying upon the Mississippi, herein secured to the Ottawa, Chippewa and Potawatomie Indians, of the Illinois ; and also by the high bluff, described in the Sioux boundary, and running north to Black river : from this point the Winnebagoes claim up Black river, to a point due west from the source of the left fork of the Quiconsin ; thence to the source of the said fork, and down the same to the Ouis-
consin ; thence down the Ouisconsin to the portage, and across the portage to Fox river ; thence down Fox river to the Winnebago lake, and to the grand Kan Kanlin , including in their claim the whole of Winnebago lake ; but, for the causes stated in the next article, this line from Black river must for the present be left indeterminate.

ARTICLE 8.

Agreement between the Menominies and
the Sioux, & c.

The representatives ofthe Menominies not being sufficiently acquainted with their proper boundaries, to settle the same definitively, and some uncertainty existing in consequence of the cession made by that tribe upon Fox River and Green Bay, to the New York Indians, it is agreed between the said Menominie tribe , and the Sioux, Chippewas, Winnebagoes, Ottawa, Chippewa and Potawatomie Indians of the Illinois, that the claim of the Menominies to any portion of the land within the boundaries allotted to either of the said tribes , shall not be barred by any stipulation herein ; but the same shall remain as valid as if this treaty had not been concluded . It is, however, understood that the
general claim of the Menominies is bounded on the north by the Chippewa country, on the east by Green Bay and lake Michigan extending as far south as Millawaukee river, and on the West they claim to Black River.
ARTICLE 9.

Boundary of the Ottawas, Chippewas, and Pottawatimies.
Ante, p . 146.

The country secured to the Ottawa, Chippewa, and Potawatomie tribes of the Illinois, is bounded as follows : Beginning at the Winnebago village, on Rock river , forty miles from its mouth, and running thence down the Rock river to a line which runs from Lake Michigan to the Mississippi, and with that line to the Mississippi , opposite to Rock Island ; thence up that river to the United States reservation , at the mouth of the Ouisconsin ; thence with the south and east lines of the said reservation to the Ouisconsin ; thence, southerly, passing the heads of the small streams emptying into the Mississippi , to the Rock river at the Winnebago village. The Illinois Indians have also a just claim to a portion of the country bounded south by the Indian boundary line aforesaid, running from the southern extreme of lake Michigan , east by lake Michigan, north by the Menominie country, and north-west by Rock river. This claim is recognized in the treaty concluded with the
said Illinois tribes at St. Louis, August 24 , 1816 , but as the Millewakee and Manetoowalk bands are not represented at this Council, it cannot be now definitively adjusted.

ARTICLE 10.

All the tribes aforesaid acknowledge the general controlling power

of the United States, and disclaim all dependence upon, and connec- Said tribes ac-

tion with, any other power. And the United States agree to, and re- knowledge the supremacy of

tions before provided. It being, however, well understood that the

reservations at Fever River, at the Ouisconsin , and St. Peters, and the

ancient settlements at Prairie des Chiens and Green Bay, and the land

property thereto belonging, and the reservations made upon the Missis-

sippi, for the use of the half breeds, in the treaty concluded with the Sacs and Foxes , August 24, 1824 , are not claimed by either of the said tribes.

Ante, p. 229.

ARTICLE 11 .

The United States agree, whenever the President may think it necessary and proper, to convene such of the tribes, either separately or together, as are interested in the lines left unsettled herein, and to recommend to them an amicable and final adjustment of their respective

of the Sioux , during the year 1826, to explain to them the stipulations of this treaty, and to procure their assent thereto, should they be disposed to give it, and also with the Ottoes, to settle and adjust their title

to any of the country claimed by the Sacs, Foxes, and Ioways.

The Commissioners of the United States assent thereto , and it is therefore agreed that a council shall accordingly be held for these purposes.

ARTICLE 13.

It is understood by all the tribes, parties hereto, that no tribe shall hunt within the acknowledged limits of any other without their assent, but it being the sole object of this arrangement to perpetuate a peace among them, and amicable relations being now restored, the Chiefs of all the tribes have expressed a determination, cheerfully to allow a re-

And whereas the United States are unwilling that difficulties should exist in the said Nation , which may eventually lead to an intestine war, and are still more unwilling that any cessions of land should be made to them, unless with the fair understanding and full assent of the Tribe making such cession , and for a just and adequate consideration, it being the policy of the United States, in all their intercourse with the Indians, to treat them justly and liberally, as becomes the relative situation of the parties.
Now, therefore, in order to remove the difficulties which have thus arisen , to satisfy the great body of the Creek Nation , and to reconcile the contending parties into which it is unhappily divided, the following articles have been agreed upon and concluded, between James Barbour, Secretary of War, specially authorised as aforesaid, and the said Chiefs and Head Men representing the Creek Nation of Indians :

Preamble.
Indians agree to the treaty of Prairie du Chien.

ARTICLE 7.

Rejection of certain articles not to affect the
validity of the others.

The necessity for the stipulations in the fourth, fifth and sixth articles of this treaty could be fully apparent, only from personal observation of the condition, prospects, and wishes of the Chippewas, and the Commissioners were therefore not specifically instructed upon the subjects

therein referred to ; but seeing the extreme poverty of these wretched

people, finding them almost naked and starving, and ascertaining that

many perished during the last winter, from hunger and cold, they were

induced to insert these articles. But it is expressly understood and

agreed, that the fourth, fifth and sixth articles, or either of them, may be

rejected by the President and Senate, without affecting the validity of the other articles of the treaty.

ARTICLE 1. Whereas, the southern boundary of the Chippewa country, from the Plover Portage of the Ouisconsin easterly, was left undefined by the treaty concluded at Prairie du Chien, August 19, 1825 , in consequence ofthe non-attendance of some ofthe principal Menomonie chiefs ; and, whereas it was provided by the said treaty, that, whenever the President of the United States might think proper, such of the tribes, parties to the said treaty, as might be interested in any particular line, should be convened , in order to agree upon its establishment ;
Therefore, in pursuance of the said provision, it is agreed between the Chippewas, Menomonies and Winebagoes, that the southern boundary of the Chippeway country shall run as follows, namely : From the Plover Portage of the Ouisconsin , on a northeasterly course, to a point on Wolf river, equidistant from the Ashawano and Post lakes of said river, thence to the falls of the Pashaytig river of Green Bay ; thence to the junction of the Neesau Kootag or Burnt-wood river, with the Menomonie ; thence to the big island of the Shoskinaubic or Smooth rock

ART. 2. Much difficulty having arisen from the negociations between the Menomonie and Winebago tribes and the various tribes and portions of tribes of Indians of the State of New York, and the claims of the
respective parties being much contested , as well with relation to the tenure and boundaries of the two tracts, claimed by the said New York

And the President is authorized, on their parts, to establish such boundaries between them and the New York Indians as he may consider equitable and just.

ART. 3. It being important to the settlement of Green Bay that defi-

nition of U. S. nite boundaries should be established between the tract claimed by the

ttirtalcettoofa lcaenrdt.ain former French and British governments, and the lands of the Indians, as well to avoid future disputes as to settle the question of jurisdic-

tion - It is therefore agreed between the Menomonie tribe and the

same ; thence with the same to Fox river ; thence on the same course,

six miles ; thence in a direct line to the southwestern boundary of the

tract, marked on the plan of the claims at Green Bay, as the settlement

at the bottom of the Bay ; thence with the southerly boundary of the

Proviso .

said tract to the southeasterly corner thereof ; and thence with the easterly boundary of the said tract to Green Bay. Provided, that if the

President of the United States should be of opinion that the boundaries

thus established interfere with any just claims of the New York Indians,

the President may then change the said boundaries in any manner he

may think proper, so that the quantity of land contained in the said

Proviso.

tract be not greater than by the boundaries herein defined . And pro-

vided also, that nothing herein contained shall be construed to have any

effect upon the land claims at Green Bay ; but the same shall remain as

though this treaty had not been formed.

hereby conclude the following Articles, viz :

ART. 1. The Western boundary of Arkansas shall be, and the same is, hereby defined , viz : A line shall be run , commencing on Red River, at the point where the Eastern Choctaw line strikes said River, and run due North with said line to the River Arkansas, thence in a direct line to the South West corner of Missouri.

South-West corner of Missouri , and thence with the Western boundary line of Missouri till it crosses the waters of Neasho, generally called Grand River, thence due West to a point from which a due South course will strike the present North West corner of Arkansas Territory, thence continuing due South, on and with the present Western boundary line ofthe Territory to the main branch of Arkansas River, thence down said River to its junction with the Canadian River, and thence up and between the said Rivers Arkansas and Canadian , to a point at which a line running North and South from River to River, will give the aforesaid seven millions of acres. In addition to the seven millions of acres
thus provided for , and bounded , the United States further guarantee to the Cherokee Nation a perpetual outlet, West, and a free and unmolested use of all the Country lying West of the Western boundary of the above described limits, and as far West as the sovereignty of the United States, and their right of soil extend.

Persons to be appointed to ivamlpureovCehmeernotkse.e

ART. 4. The United States moreover agree to appoint suitable persons whose duty it shall be, in conjunction with the Agent, to value all such improvements as the Cherokees may abandon in their removal from their present homes to the District of Country as ceded in the second Article of this agreement, and to pay for the same immediately after the assessment is made, and the amount ascertained. It is further agreed, that the property and improvements connected with the agency, shall be sold under the direction of the Agent, and the proceeds of the same applied to aid in the erection , in the country to which the Cherokees are going, of a Grist, and Saw Mill, for their use. The aforesaid property and improvements are thus defined : Commence at the Arkansas River opposite William Stinnetts, and run due North one mile, thence due East to a point from which a due South line to the Arkansas River would include the Chalybeate, or Mineral Spring, attached to or near the present residence of the Agent, and thence up said River ( Arkansas) to the place of beginning.

Further agreement.

ART. 5. It is further agreed , that the United States, in consideration of the inconvenience and trouble attending the removal , and on account of the reduced value of a great portion of the lands herein ceded to the Cherokees, as compared with that of those in Arkansas which were made theirs by the Treaty of 1817 , and Convention of 1819, will pay to the Cherokees, immediately after their removal which shall be within fourteen months of the date of this agreement, the sum of fifty thousand dollars ; also an annuity, for three years, of two thousand dollars, towards defraying the cost and trouble which may attend upon going after and recovering their stock which may stray into the Territory in quest of the pastures from which they may be driven- also, eight thousand seven hundred and sixty dollars, for spoliations committed on them, (the Cherokees, ) which sum will be in full of all demands of the kind up to this date, as well those against the Osages, as those against citizens of the United States - this being the amount of the claims for said spoliations, as rendered by the Cherokees, and which are believed to be correctly and fairly stated. Also, one thou-

ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT

Feb. 8, 1831.
Proclamation, July 9, 1832.

Made and concluded at the City of Washington, this eighth day of February, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-one, between John H. Eaton , Secretary of War, and Samuel C. Stambaugh, Indian Agent at Green Bay, specially authorized by the President of the United States, and the undersigned chiefs and head men of the Menomonee nation of Indians, fully authorized and empowered by the said nation , to conclude and settle all matters provided for by this agreement.

Boundaries of Menomonee
country.

THE Menomonee Tribe of Indians, by their delegates in council , this day, define the boundaries of their country as follows, to wit ;
On the east side of Green Bay, Fox river, and Winnebago lake ; beginning at the south end of Winnebago lake ; thence southeastwardly to the Milwauky or Manawauky river ; thence down said river to its mouth at lake Michigan ; thence north, along the shore of lake Michigan , to the mouth of Green Bay ; thence up Green Bay, Fox river, and Winnebago lake, to the place of beginning. And on the west side of Fox river as follows : beginning at the mouth of Fox river , thence down the east shore of Green bay, and across its mouth, so as to include all the islands of the " Grand Traverse ;" thence westerly, on the highlands

between the lake Superior and Green bay, to the upper forks of the Menomonee river ; thence to the Plover portage of the Wisconsin river ; thence up the Wisconsin river, to the Soft Maple river ; thence to the source of the Soft Maple river ; thence west to the Plume river, which falls into the Chippeway river ; thence down said Plume river to its mouth ; thence down the Chippeway river thirty miles ; thence easterly to the forks of the Manoy river, which falls into the Wisconsin river ; thence down the said Manoy river to its mouth ; thence down the Wisconsin river to the Wisconsin portage ; thence across the said portage

to the Fox river ; thence down Fox river to its mouth at Green bay, or the place of beginning.
The country described within the above boundaries, the Menomonees claim as the exclusive property of their tribe. Not yet having disposed of any of their lands, they receive no annuities from the United States : whereas their brothers the Pootowottomees on the south, and the Winnebagoes on the west, have sold a great portion of their country, receive large annuities, and are now encroaching upon the lands of the Menomonees. For the purposes, therefore, of establishing the boundaries

of their country, and of ceding certain portions of their lands to the United States, in order to secure great and lasting benefits to them-

selves and posterity, as well as for the purpose of settling the long existing dispute between themselves and the several tribes of the New York

Indians, who claim to have purchased a portion of their lands, the undersigned, chiefs and headmen of the Menomonee tribe, stipulate and agree with the United States, as follows :
First. The Menomonee tribe of Indians declare themselves the friends and allies of the United States, under whose parental care and protec-

tion they desire to continue ; and although always protesting that they

are under no obligation to recognise any claim of the New York In-

dians to any portion of their country ; that they neither sold , nor received any value, for the land claimed by these tribes ; yet, at the solicitation of their Great Father, the President of the United States, and as an evidence of their love and veneration for him, they agree that such part of the land described, being within the following boundaries, as he may direct, may be set apart as a home to the several tribes of the New York

ning on the Fox river, at the mouth of the first creek above Fort How-

ard; thence north sixty-four degrees west to Duck creek ; thence down said Duck creek to its mouth ; thence up and along Green bay and Fox river to the place of beginning. The Menomonee Indians, also reserve,

for the use ofthe United States, from the country herein designated for

the New York Indians, timber and firewood for the United States' gar-

rison, and as much land as may be deemed necessary for public highways, to be located by the direction , and at the discretion of the Presi-

dent of the United States. The country hereby ceded to the United

States, for the benefit of the New York Indians, contains by estimation about five hundred thousand acres, and includes all their improvements on the west side of Fox river. As it is intended for a home for the

several tribes of the New York Indians, who may be residing upon the

lands at the expiration of three years from this date, and for none others,

the President of the United States is hereby empowered to apportion

the lands among the actual occupants at that time, so as not to assign

to any tribe a greater number of acres than may be equal to one hun-

dred for each soul actually settled upon the lands, and if, at the time

of such apportionment, any lands shall remain unoccupied by any tribe

of the New York Indians, such portion as would have belonged to said Indians, had it been occupied, shall revert to the United States. That portion, if any, so reverting, to be laid off by the President of the United

States. It is distinctly understood, that the lands hereby ceded to the United States for the New York Indians, are to be held by those tribes, under such tenure as the Menonomee Indians now hold their lands,

subject to such regulations and alteration of tenure, as Congress and the President of the United States shall , from time to time, think proper

to adopt. Second. For the above cession to the United States, for the benefit of
the New York Indians, the United States consent to pay the Menomonee Indians, twenty thousand dollars ; five thousand to be paid on the first day of August next, and five thousand annually thereafter ; which sums

Third. The Menomonee tribe of Indians, in consideration of the kindness and protection of the Government of the United States , and for the purpose of securing to themselves and posterity, a comfortable
home, hereby cede and forever relinquish to the United States, all their country on the southeast side of Winnebago lake, Fox river, and Green

The above reservation being made to the Menomonee Indians for the purpose of weaning them from their wandering habits , by attaching them to comfortable homes, the President of the United States, as a mark of affection for his children ofthe Menomonee tribe , will cause to be employed
five farmers of established character for capacity, industry, and moral habits, for ten successive years, whose duty it shall be to assist the Menomonee Indians in the cultivation of their farms, and to instruct their
children in the business and occupation of farming. Also, five females shall be employed, of like good character, for the purpose of teaching young Menomonee women , in the business of useful housewifery, during a period of ten years.-The annual compensation allowed to the farmers, shall not exceed five hundred dollars , and that of the females three hundred dollars. And the United States will cause to be erected, houses
suited to their condition, on said lands, as soon as the Indians agree to occupy them, for which ten thousand dollars shall be appropriated ; also, houses for the farmers, for which three thousand dollars shall be appropriated ; to be expended under the direction of the Secretary of War. Whenever the Menomonees thus settle their lands, they shall be supplied with useful household articles, horses, cows, hogs, and sheep, farming utensils, and other articles of husbandry necessary to their comfort, to the value of six thousand dollars ; and they desire that some suitable device may be stamped upon such articles, to preserve them from sale or barter, to evil disposed white persons : none of which, nor any other articles with which the United States may at any time furnish them, shall be liable to sale, or be disposed of or bargained, without permission of the agent.

TREATY WITH THE MENOMONIES. 1831.

behalf of their tribe, solemnly pledge themselves to preserve peace and harmony between their people and the Government of the United States

forever. They neither acknowledge the power nor protection of any other State or people . A departure from this pledge by any portion of their tribe, shall be a forfeiture of the protection of the United States' Government , and their annuities will cease. In thus declaring their friendship for the United States, however, the Menomonee tribe of Indians, having the most implicit confidence in their great father, the President of the United States, desire that he will, as a kind and faith-

ful guardian of their welfare, direct the provisions of this compact to be carried into immediate effect. The Menomonee chiefs request that such part of it as relates to the New York Indians, be immediately submitted to the representatives of their tribes. And if they refuse to

direct their immediate removal from the Menomonee country ; but if they agree to accept of the liberal offer made to them by the parties to this compact, then the Menomonee tribe as dutiful children of their

great father the President, will take them by the hand as brothers, and

settle down with them in peace and friendship. The boundary, as stated and defined in this agreement, of the Me-
nomonee country, with the exception of the cessions herein before made

to the United States, the Menomonees claim as their country ; that part of it adjoining the farming country, on the west side of Fox river, will
remain to them as heretofore, for a hunting ground , until the President 44

of the United States, shall deem it expedient to extinguish their title. In that case, the Menomonee tribe promise to surrender it immediately, upon being notified of the desire of Government to possess it. The additional annuity then to be paid to the Menomonee tribe, to be fixed by the President of the United States. It is conceded to the United States that they may enjoy the right of making such roads, and of establishing such military posts, in any part of the country now occupied by the Menomonee nation, as the President at any time may think

proper. As a further earnest of the good feeling on the part of their great
father, it is agreed that the expenses of the Menomonee delegation to the city of Washington , and of returning, will be paid, and that a comfortable suit of clothes will be provided for each ; also, that the United States will cause four thousand dollars to be expended in procuring fowling guns, and ammunition for them ; and likewise, in lieu of any garrison rations, hereafter allowed or received by them, there shall be
procured and given to said tribe one thousand dollars worth of good and wholesome provisions annually, for four years, by which time it is hoped their hunting habits may cease, and their attention be turned to

the pursuits of agriculture.

WHEREAS certain articles of agreement were entered into and concluded at the city of Washington, on the 8th day of February instant, between the undersigned , Commissioners on behalf of the United States, and the chiefs and warriors, representing the Menomonee tribe of Indians, whereby a portion of the Menomonee country, on the northwest side of Fox river and Green bay, was ceded to the United States, for the benefit of the New York Indians, upon certain conditions and restrictions therein expressed : And whereas it has been represented to the parties to that agreement, who are parties hereto, that it would be more desirable and satisfactory to some of those interested that one or two immaterial changes be made in the first and sixth articles, so as not to limit the number of acres to one hundred for each soul who may be settled upon the land when the President apportions it, as also to make unlimited the time of removal and settlement upon these lands by the New York Indians, but to leave both these matters discretionary with the President of the United States.

Now, therefore, as a proof of the sincerity of the professions made by the Menomonee Indians, when they declared themselves anxious to ter-

minate in an amicable manner , their disputes with the New York Indians,

and also as a further proof of their love and veneration for their great father, the President of the United States, the undersigned, representa-

tives of the Menomonee tribe of Indians , unite and agree with the Commissioners aforesaid, in making and acknowledging the following sup-

plementary articles a part of their former aforesaid agreement. First. It is agreed between the undersigned , commissioners on behalf

the time for the removal and settlement of the New York Indians upon

the lands thus provided for them ; and , at the expiration of such reasonable time, he shall apportion the land among the actual settlers , in such

manner as he shall deem equitable and just. And if, within such reasonable time, as the President of the United States shall prescribe for

that purpose, the New York Indians, shall refuse to accept the provi-

sions made for their benefit, or having agreed , shall neglect or refuse to remove from New York , and settle on the said lands, within the time

prescribed for that purpose, that then, and in either of these events, the lands aforesaid shall be, and remain the property of the United States,

according to said first article, excepting so much thereof, as the Presi-

dent shall deem justly due to such of the New York Indians, as shall actually have removed to, and settled on the said lands.

Second. It is further agreed that the part of the sixth article of the agreement aforesaid, which requires the removal of those of the New

York Indians, who may not be settled on the lands at the end of three

years , shall be so amended as to leave such removal discretionary with the President of the United States. The Menomonee Indians having

ration the welfare and prosperity of their nation.

ARTICLES OF A TREATY

Made and entered into between Genl. John Coffee, being duly Oct. 20, 1832 . authorised thereto, by the President of the United States, and Proclamation, the whole Chickasaw Nation, in General Council assembled, at March 1 , 1833.
the Council House, on Pontitock Creek on the twentieth day of October, 1832.

THE Chickasaw Nation find themselves oppressed in their present situation ; by being made subject to the laws of the States in which they reside. Being ignorant of the language and laws of the white man,
they cannot understand or obey them. Rather than submit to this great evil, they prefer to seek a home in the west, where they may live and be governed by their own laws. And believing that they can procure for themselves a home, in a country suited to their wants and condition,

Preamble.

382

TREATY WITH THE CHICKASAWS . 1832.

Cession of lands to U. S.

provided they had the means to contract and pay for the same, they have determined to sell their country and hunt a new home. The President has heard the complaints of the Chickasaws, and like them believes they cannot be happy, and prosper as a nation , in their present situation and condition, and being desirous to relieve them from the great calamity that seems to await them, if they remain as they are -- He has sent his Commissioner Genl. John Coffee, who has met the whole Chickasaw nation in Council, and after mature deliberation , they have entered into the following articles, which shall be binding on both parties, when the same shall be ratified by the President of the United States by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.
ARTICLE I. For the consideration hereinafter expressed, the Chickasaw nation do hereby cede, to the United States, all the land which they own on the east side of the Mississippi river, including all the country where they at present live and occupy.

Ceded lands
to be surveyed, & c.

ARTICLE II. The United States agree to have the whole country thus ceded , surveyed, as soon as it can be conveniently done, in the same
manner that the public lands of the United States are surveyed in the States of Mississippi and Alabama, and as soon thereafter as may be practicable, to have the same prepared for sale. The President of the United States will then offer the land for sale at public auction, in the same manner and on the same terms and conditions as the other public lands , and such of the land as may not sell at the public sales shall be offered at private sale, in the same manner that other private sales are made of the United States lands.

Compensation to Chickasaws.

ARTICLE III. As a full compensation to the Chickasaw nation , for the country thus ceded, the United States agree to pay over to the Chickasaw nation , all the money arising from the sale of the land which may be received from time to time, after deducting therefrom the whole cost and expenses of surveying and selling the land, including every expense attending the same.

Chickasaws to seek a home west of the Mississippi.
In case they fail to procure such a home.
Allotments .

ARTICLE IV. The President being determined that the Chickasaw people shall not deprive themselves of a comfortable home, in the country where they now are, untill they shall have provided a country in the west to remove to, and settle on, with fair prospects of future comfort and happiness- It is therefore agreed to, by the Chickasaw nation, that they will endeavor as soon as it may be in their power, after the ratification of this treaty, to hunt out and procure a home for their people, west of the Mississippi river, suited to their wants and condition ; and they will continue to do so during the progress of the survey of their present country, as is provided for in the second article of this treaty. But should they fail to procure such a country to remove to and settle on, previous to the first public sale of their country here then and in that event, they are to select out of the surveys, a comfortable settlement for every family in the Chickasaw nation , to include their present improvements, if the land is good for cultivation , and if not they may take it in any other place in the nation , which is unoccupied by any other person. Such settlement must be taken by sections. And there shall be allotted to each family as follows (to wit) : To a single man who is twenty-one years of age, one section-to each family of five and under that number two sections- to each family of six and not exceeding ten, three sections, and to each family over ten in number, four sections and to families who own slaves, there shall be allowed, one section to those who own ten or upwards and such as own under ten, there shall be allowed half a section. If any person shall now occupy two places and wish to retain both, they may do so, by taking a part at one place, and a part at the other, and where two or more persons are

TREATY WITH THE CHICKASAWS . 1832.

383

now living on the same section , the oldest occupant will be entitled to

remain, and the others must move off to some other place if so required

by the oldest occupant. All of which tracts of land, so selected and

retained, shall be held, and occupied by the Chickasaw people, uninter-

rupted until they shall find and obtain a country suited to their wants and condition. And the United States will guaranty to the Chickasaw
nation, the quiet possession and uninterrupted use of the said reserved tracts of land, so long as they may live on and occupy the same. And

Guaranty by U. S. When Chick-

when they shall determine to remove from said tracts of land, the Chick- amsianwestoderteemro-ve, asaw nation will notify the President of the United States of their deter- they will give
mination to remove, and thereupon as soon as the Chickasaw people notice, &c.

shall remove, the President will proclaim the said reserved tracts of

land for sale at public auction and at private sale, on the same terms

and conditions, as is provided for in the second article of this treaty, to

sell the same, and the nett proceeds thereof, to be paid to the Chicka-

saw nation, as is provided for in the third article of this treaty.

ARTICLE V. If any of the Chickasaw families shall have made valua- Improvements ble improvements on the places where they lived and removed from, on t&ocb.e valued, the reservation tracts, the same shall be valued by some discreet person to be appointed by the President, who shall assess the real cash value of all such improvements, and also the real cash value of all the land within their improvements, which they may have cleared and actually cultivated, at least one year in good farming order and condition . And such valuation of the improvements and the value of the cultivated lands as before mentioned , shall be paid to the person who shall have made the same. To be paid out of the proceeds of the sales of the ceded

lands. The person who shall value such land and improvements , shall give to the owner thereof, a certificate of the valuation , which shall be a good voucher for them to draw the money on , from the proper person, who shall be appointed to pay the same, and the money shall be paid, as soon as may be convenient, after the valuation , to enable the owner

thereof to provide for their families on their journey to their new homes. The provisions of this article are intended to encourage industry and to enable the Chickasaws to move comfortably. But least the good in-
tended may be abused, by designing persons, by hiring hands and clearing more land, than they otherwise would do for the benefit of their

families-It is determined that no payment shall be made for improved lands, over and above one-eighth part of the tract allowed and reserved for such person to live on and occupy.

ARTICLE VI. The Chickasaw nation cannot receive any part of the
payment for their land untill it shall be surveyed and sold ; therefore, in order to the greater facility, in surveying and preparing the land for sale, and for keeping the business of the nation separate and apart from the business and accounts of the United States, it is proposed by the Chickasaws, and agreed to, that a Surveyor General be appointed by the President, to superintend alone the surveying of this ceded country or so much thereof as the President may direct, who shall appoint a sufficient number of deputy surveyors, as may be necessary to com-plete
the survey, in as short a time as may be reasonable and expedient. That the said Surveyor General be allowed one good clerk, and one good draftsman to aid and assist him in the business of his office, in preparing the lands for sale. It is also agreed that one land office be established for the sale of the lands, to have one Register and one Receiver of monies, to be appointed by the President, and each Register and Receiver to have one good clerk to aid and assist them in the duties of their office . The Surveyor's office , and the office of the Register and Receiver of money, shall be kept somewhere central in the nation , at such place as the President of the United States may direct. As the

Surveyor- general to be appointed, &c.

before mentioned officers, and clerks , are to be employed entirely in

Salaries of

business of the nation, appertaining to preparing and selling the land, they will of course be paid out of the proceeds of the sales of the ceded lands. That the Chickasaws, may now understand as near as may be, the expenses that will be incurred in the transacting of this businessIt is proposed and agreed to, that the salary of the Surveyor General be

Surveyor-gene- fifteen hundred dollars a year, and that the Register and Receiver of ral, & c.
monies, be allowed twelve hundred dollars a year each, as a full com-

pensation for their services, and all expenses, except stationary and postages on their official business, and that each of the clerks and

draftsman be allowed seven hundred and fifty dollars a year, for their services and all expenses.**

No pre- emp-

ARTICLE VII. It is expressly agreed that the United States shall not

tion rights to be grant any right of preference, to any person , or right of occupancy in granted by U.S. any manner whatsoever , but in all cases, of either public or private sale,

they are to sell the land to the highest bidder, and also that none of the

lands be sold in smaller tracts than quarter sections or fractional sections

of the same size as near as may be, untill the Chickasaw nation may Combinations require the President to sell in smaller tracts. The Chiefs ofthe nation

among purchasers to be
prevented.

have heard that at some of the sales of the United States lands , the people there present, entered into combinations, and united in purchasing much of the land , at reduced prices, for their own benefit, to the

great prejudice of the Government, and they express fears, that attempts will be made to cheat them, in the same manner when their lands shall

be offered at public auction . It is therefore agreed that the President

will use his best endeavours, to prevent such combinations, or any other

plan or state of things which may tend to prevent the land selling for its full value.

Reduction of price, & c.

ARTICLE VIII. As the Chickasaws have determined to sell their
country, it is desirable that the nation realize the greatest possible sum for their lands, which can be obtained . It is therefore proposed and agreed to that after the President shall have offered their lands for sale and shall have sold all that will sell for the Government price, then the price shall be reduced, so as to induce purchasers to buy, who would not take the land at the Government minimum price ; -and it is believed, that five years from and after the date of the first sale , will dispose of all the lands, that will sell at the Government price. If then at the expiration of five years, as before mentioned, the Chickasaw nation may request the President to sell at such reduced price as the nation may then propose, it shall be the duty of the President to comply with their
request, by first offering it at public and afterwards at private sale, as in all other cases of selling public lands.

Agent to be continued
asmawosn.g Chicka-

ARTICLE IX. The Chickasaw nation express their ignorance, and
incapacity to live, and be happy under the State laws, they cannot read and understand them, and therefore they will always need a friend to advise and direct them. And fearing at some day the Government of the United States may withdraw from them, the agent under whose instructions they have lived so long and happy-They therefore request that the agent may be continued with them, while here, and wherever they may remove to and settle. It is the earnest wish of the United States Government to see the Chickasaw nation prosper and be happy, and so far as is consistent they will contribute all in their power to render them so therefore their request is granted. There shall be an
agent kept with the Chickasaws as heretofore, so long as they live within

This article was amended, previous to ratification, by the insertion, after " President," where that word occurs the first and third times, of the words, " by and with the advice and consent of the Senate."

TREATY WITH THE CHICKASAWS . 1832.

385

the jurisdiction of the United States as a nation, either within the limits of the States where they now reside, or at any other place. And whenever the office of agent shall be vacant , and an agent to be appointed, the President will pay due respect to the wishes of the nation in selecting a man in all respects qualified to discharge the responsible duties of that office.

ARTICLE X. Whenever the Chickasaw nation shall determine to
remove from , and leave their present country, they will give the President of the United States timely notice of such intention, and the President will furnish them , the necessary funds, and means for their transportation and journey, and for one years provisions, after they reach their new homes, in such quantity as the nation may require, and the full amount of such funds, transportation and provisions, is to be paid for, out of the proceeds of the sales of the ceded lands. And should the
Chickasaw nation remove, from their present country, before they receive money, from the sale of the lands, hereby ceded ; then and in that case, the United States shall furnish them any reasonable sum of money for national purposes, which may be deemed proper by the President of the United States, which sum shall also be refunded out of the sales of the ceded lands.

Expenses of removal, &c.

ARTICLE XI . The Chickasaw nation have determined to create a Chickasaw

perpetual fund, for the use of the nation forever, out of the proceeds of fund. the country now ceded away. And for that purpose they propose to

invest a large proportion of the money arising from the sale of the land, in some safe and valuable stocks, which will bring them in an annual

interest or dividend, to be used for all national purposes , leaving the principal untouched , intending to use the interest alone. It is therefore proposed by the Chickasaws, and agreed to, that the sum to be laid

out in stocks as above mentioned , shall be left with the government of the United States, untill it can be laid out under the direction of the

President of the United States, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, in such safe and valuable stock as he may approve of, for the use and benefit of the Chickasaw nation. The sum thus to be in-

vested, shall be equal to, at least three-fourths of the whole nett proceeds of the sales of the lands ; and as much more, as the nation may deter-

mine, if there shall be a surplus after supplying all the national wants. But it is hereby provided, that if the reasonable wants of the nation

shall require more than one fourth of the proceeds of the sales of the land, then they may, by the consent of the President and Senate, draw from the government such sum as may be thought reasonable, for valuable national purposes, out of the three-fourths reserved to be laid out in stocks. But if any of the monies shall be thus drawn out of the sum

first proposed, to be laid out on interest, the sum shall be replaced, out of the first monies of the nation , which may come into the possession

of the United States government, from the sale of the ceded lands, over and above the reasonable wants of the nation . At the expiration offifty years from this date, if the Chickasaw nation shall have improved in

education and civilization , and become so enlightened , as to be capable of managing so large a sum of money to advantage, and with safety, for the benefit of the nation , and the President of the United States, with

the Senate, shall be satisfied thereof, at that time, and shall give their consent thereto, the Chickasaw nation may then withdraw the whole, or any part of the fund now set apart, to be laid out in stocks , or at

interest, and dispose of the same, in any manner that they may think proper at that time, for the use and benefit of the whole nation ; but no

part of said fund shall ever be used for any other purpose, than the benefit of the whole Chickasaw nation . In order to facilitate the sur-

vey and sale of the lands now ceded, and to raise the money therefrom

TREATY WITH THE CHICKASAWS. 1832.

as soon as possible, for the foregoing purpose, the President of the United States is authorised to commence the survey of the land as soon
as may be practicable, after the ratification of this treaty.

Annuities to chiefs, & c.
Annuity to Queen Puccaun- la

ARTICLE XII. The Chickasaws feel grateful to their old chiefs , for their long and faithful services, in attending to the business of the nation. They believe it a duty, to keep them from want in their old and declining age-with those feelings, they have looked upon their old and be loved chief Tish-o-mingo, who is now grown old, and is poor
and not able to live, in that comfort, which his valuable life and great merit deserve. It is therefore determined to give him out of the national
funds, one hundred dollars a year during the balance of his life, and the nation request him to receive it, as a token of their kind feelings for him, on account of his long and valuable services.
Our old and beloved Queen Puc-caun-la, is now very old and very
poor. Justice says the nation ought not to let her suffer in her old age; it is therefore determined to give her out of the national funds, fifty dollars a year during her life, the money to be put in the hands of the agent to be laid out for her support, under his direction , with the advice of the chiefs.

Boundary line betweer. Chickasaws and Choctaws.

ARTICLE XIII. The boundary line between the lands of the Chickasaws and Choctaws, has never been run , or properly defined, and as the Choctaws have sold their country to the United States, they now have no interest in the decision of that question . It is therefore agreed to

call on the old Choctaw chiefs to determine the line to be run , between the Chickasaws and their former country. The Chickasaws, by a treaty

made with the United States at Franklin in Tennessee, in Aug. 1830, (a) declared their line to run as follows, to wit : Beginning at the mouth of

Oak tibby-haw and running up said stream to a point, being a marked

tree, on the old Natches road , one mile southwardly from Wall's old

place. Thence with the Choctaw boundary, and along it, westwardly

through the Tunicha old fields, to a point on the Mississippi river, about twenty-eight miles by water, below where the St. Francis river enters

said stream on the west side. It is now agreed, that the surveys of the

Choctaw country which are now in progress , shall not cross the line until the true line shall be decided and determined ; which shall be

done as follows, the agent of the Choctaws on the west side of the Mis-

sissippi shall call on the old and intelligent chiefs of that nation , and

lay before them the line as claimed by the Chickasaws at the Franklin

treaty, and ifthe Choctaws shall determine that line to be correct, then

it shall be established and made the permanent line, but if the Choc-

taws say the line strikes the Mississippi river higher up said stream , then the best evidence which can be had from both nations, shall be

taken by the agents of both nations, and submitted to the President of

the United States for his decision, and on such evidence, the President

will determine the true line on principles of strict justice.

List of reserva- ARTICLE XIV. As soon as the surveys are made, it shall be the duty

.ions.

of the chiefs, with the advice and assistance of the agent to cause a

correct list to be made out of all and every tract of land , which shall be

reserved, for the use and benefit of the Chickasaw people, for their residence, as is provided for in the fourth article of this treaty, which list, will designate the sections of land, which are set apart for each family or individual in the nation , shewing the precise tracts which shall belong to each and every one of them, which list shall be returned to the re-

gister of the land office, and he shall make a record of the same, in his office, to prevent him from offering any of said tracts of land for sale, and also as evidence of each person's lands. All the residue of the lands will be offered by the President for sale.

(a) This treaty appears not to have been finally concluded .

ARTICLE XV. The Chickasaws request that no persons be permitted to move in and settle on their country before the land is sold. It is
therefore agreed, that no person , whatsoever, who is not Chickasaw or connected with the Chickasaws by marriage, shall be permitted to come

into the country and settle on any part of the ceded lands untill they shall be offered for sale, and then there shall not be any person permit-

ted to settle on any of the land, which has not been sold, at the time of such settlement, and in all cases of a person settling on any of the

ceded lands contrary to this express understanding , they will be intru-

ders, and must be treated as such, and put off of the lands of the nation.

In witness of all and every thing herein determined , between the United States and the whole Chickasaw nation in general council assembled, the parties have hereunto set their hands and seals , at the council house, on Pontitock creek, in the Chickasaw nation, on this twentieth day of October, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-two.

ARTICLES

Oct. 22, 1832.

Supplementary to, and explanatory of, a Treaty which was entered into on the 20th instant, between General John Coffee on the part ofthe United States, and the whole Chickasaw nation in General Council assembled.

Leases of reservations forbidden.
Reservations to be sold low for the benefit of the nation, & c.
Minimum price.
Private sales.
Plan for sales to be agreed upon.
Reserves to young men, & c.

THE fourth article of the treaty to which this is a supplement, provides that each Chickasaw family, shall have a tract of land, reserved for the use of the family, to live on and occupy, so long as the nation resides in the country where they now are. And the fifth article of the treaty provides that each family or individual shall be paid for their improvements, and the value of their cleared lands, when the nation shall determine to remove and leave the said reserved tracts of land. It is
now proposed and agreed to, that no family or person of the Chickasaw nation , who shall or may have tracts of land, reserved for their residence while here, shall ever be permitted to lease any of said land, to any person whatsoever, nor shall they be permitted to rent any of said land, to any person, either white, red, or black , or mixed blood of either. As the great object of the nation is to preserve the land , and timber, for the benefit of posterity, provided the nation shall continue to live here, and if they shall at any time determine to remove and sell the land , it will be more valuable, and will sell for more money, for the benefit of the nation , if the land and timber be preserved.
It is also expressly declared by the nation, that, whenever the nation shall determine to remove from their present country, that every tract
of land so reserved in the nation , shall be given up and sold for the benefit of the nation. And no individual or family shall have any right to retain any of such reserved tracts of land, for their own use, any longer than the nation may remain in the country where they now are.
As the reserve tracts of land above alluded to, will be the first choice of land in the nation, it is determined that the minimum price of all the reserved tracts , shall be three dollars an acre, until the nation may determine to reduce the price, and then they will notify the President, of their wishes, and the price to which they desire to reduce it.
The Chiefs still express fears that combinations may be formed at the public sales, where their reserved tracts of land shall be offered for sale, and that they may not be sold so high as they might be sold , by judicious agents at private sale. They therefore suggest the propriety of the President determining on some judicious mode of selling the reserves at private sale.
It is therefore agreed that the suggestion be submitted to the President, and if he and the Chiefs can agree on a plan of a sale, different from the one proposed in the treaty, to which this is a supplement, and which shall be approved of by both parties, then they may enter into such agreement and the President shall then be governed by the same, in the sale of the reserved tracts of land, whenever they may be offered for sale.
In the provisions of the fourth article of the treaty to which this is a supplement, for reserves to young men who have no families, it expresses that each young man, who is twenty-one years of age, shall have a reserve. But as the Indians mature earlier than white men, and
generally marry younger, it is determined to extend a reserve, to each young man who is seventeen years of age. And as there are some
(388)

TREATY WITH THE CHICKASAWS . 1832 .

389

orphan girls in the nation or whose families do not provide for them , and also some widows in the same situation , it is determined to allow to each of them a reservation of one section , on the same terms and con-

ditions in all respects, with the other reservations for the nation generally, and to be allowed to the same ages, as to young men.
Colbert Moore and family have always lived in the Chickasaw nation, and he requests the liberty to continue with the nation. The Chiefs and nation agree to his request, and they also agree to allow him and his family a reserve tract of land to live on and occupy in the same manner, and on the same terms and conditions as is provided for the Chickasaw families, in the nation generally, during his good behavior.
The Chiefs of the nation represent that they in behalf of the nation gave a bond to James Colbert for a debt due to him, of eighteen hundred and eleven dollars, ninety-three and three fourth cents principal, that James Colbert transferred said note to Robert Gordon and that said

Section of land to R. Gordon.

note, and the interest thereon is yet due and unpaid, and the said Robert Gordon has proposed to take a section of land for said note, and interest up to this date. It is therefore agreed by the nation to grant him a section of land, to be taken any where in the nation, so as not to interfere with any reserve which has been provided as a residence for the Chickasaws, which shall be in full for said note and interest.
The Treaty, to which this is a supplement provides that there shall Section ofland
be offices kept some where central in the nation , at such place as the f&orc.land office , President shall determine, for transacting the business of the nation , in

selling their lands & c. It is now agreed to by the nation, that the

President may select a section of land, or four quarter sections adjoining, at such place as he may determine agreeably to that provision of the Treaty, to establish the said offices on, and for all the necessary

uses thereto attached, and he is permitted to improve the said tract of land in any manner, whatsoever, but when it shall cease to be used for

the purposes, for which it is set apart-for offices & c.-then the same

shall be sold under the direction of the President- and the proceeds

thereof shall be paid to the Chickasaw nation , after deducting therefrom the value of all the improvements on the land, which value shall be assessed by the President, and in no case shall it exceed one half the sale of the land.
The Chickasaw nation request the Government to grant them a cross mail route through the nation as follows, one to pass from Tuscumbia in Alabama, by the Agency, and by the place to be selected for the

Mail route.

offices to be kept and to Rankin in Mississippi on horse back , once a week each way. The other to run from Memphis in Tennessee, by the offices and to the Cotton Gin in Mississippi- to pass once a week each way. They conceive these mails would be useful to the nation , and indispensible to the carrying on the business of the nation when the

offices are established , but they would respectfully solicit the mails to be started as soon as possible, to open the avenues of information into their country.
John Donley has long been known in this nation, as a mail carrier ;

Section ofland

he rode on the mails through our nation when a boy and for many years to J. Donley. after he was grown ; we think he understands that business as well, if

not better than any other man-and we should prefer him to carry our mails to any other person -and if he is given the contract, the nation will set apart a section of land for his use while we remain here in this country, which section he may select with the advice of the Chiefs any

where that suits him best, so as not to interfere with any of the reserves, and he may use it in any manner to live on , or make such improvements as may be necessary for keeping his horses, or to raise forage for

them . But when the nation shall move away and leave this country this tract of land must be sold for the benefit of the nation, in the same

manner that the reserve tracts are sold & c. and he is not to claim of the nation any pay for improving said tract of land.
[ The lease which was given to William B. Lewis under the provisions of the treaty of the 19th October 1818 was altered and renewed in a treaty which was signed at Franklin in Tennessee in August 1830 --at which time Robert P. Currin of Franklin had become a partner with William B. Lewis. In said treaty at Franklin the said Lewis & Currin (having failed to obtain salt) agreed to pay the nation a sum of money as therein expressed, for the use of the land during the term of the lease, and also a small quantity of salt, as is also expressed- a part of the money was then paid to the nation in hand, with their obligation to pay the whole balance by instalments. But Mr. Currin , who seems now to be the sole owner of that contract, says he cannot pay us, because the Government refuses to admit his title under the lease. Thus the nation is kept out of the money for the lease. Mr. Currin has ad-
dressed a line to Levi Colbert and James Brown , the agents for the Chickasaws, in that business, and also one to Genl. Coffee the United States Commissioner, asking them to place his claim in a situation that he may have the use of the land, or that the Government take the land, and pay him for it at the Government minimum price. The Chickasaw
nation feel desirous to have the matter settled amicably, and they have no wish to violate their last contract-but as Robert P. Currin represents to the nation , that he is willing and desirous to settle it, by the nation ceding the land to the Government of the United States, upon the condition that they pay him for the land at the rate of one dollar and twenty-five cents an acre, to be paid in one year after the ratification of this treaty-We the Chickasaw nation do hereby cede the said reserve tract of four miles square, to the United States, on the following terms and conditions- they shall pay for the land one dollar and twentyfive cents an acre, three-fourths of the amount to be paid to Robert P. Currin , which shall be in full for all his right and claim to said lands-- and one-fourth to the Chickasaw nation, for their interest in changing the lease, to a final sale forever. If this agreement is not approved of by Mr. Currin and ratified by the President and Senate its rejection shall not affect the balance of this treaty. ]*

In witness of all and every thing herein determined between the United States and the whole Chickasaw nation, in general Council assembled, the parties have hereunto set their hands and seals at the Council house, on Pontitock Creek , in the Chickasaw nation on this twenty-second day of October one thousand eight hundred and thirty-two.

D. one thousand eight hundred and thirty-one, by John H. Eaton , and Samuel C. Stambaugh, Commissioners on the part of the United States, and certain Chiefs and Headmen of the Menominee Nation , on the part of said nation ; to which articles, an addition or supplemental article was afterwards made, on the seventeenth day of Februry in the same year , by which the said Menominee Nation agree to cede to the United States certain parts of their land ; and that a tract of country therein defined shall be set apart for the New York Indians. All which with the many other stipulations

Proclamation , March 13, 1833. Preamble.

therein contained will more fully appear, by reference to the same. Which said agreements thus forming a Treaty, were laid before the Senate of the United States during their then session : but were not at said session acted on by that body. Whereupon a further agreement

was on the fifteenth day of March, in the same year, entered into for the purpose of preserving the provisions ofthe treaty, made as aforesaid ; by which it was stipulated that the said articles of agreement , concluded as aforesaid, should be laid before the next Senate of the United States, at their ensuing session ; and if sanctioned and confirmed by them, that

each and every article thereof should be as binding and obligatory upon the parties respectively, as if they had been sanctioned at the previous

session. And whereas the Senate of the United States, by their reso-

lution of the twenty-fifth day of June, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-two, did advise and consent to accept, ratify and confirm the same, and every clause and article thereof upon the conditions expressed in the proviso, contained in their said resolution : which proviso is as

follows : " Provided that for the purpose of establishing the rights ofthe New York Indians, on a permanent and just footing, the said treaty shall be ratified, with the express understanding that two townships of land on the east side of Winnebago Lake, equal to forty-six thousand and eighty acres shall be laid off ( to commence at some point to be agreed on) for the use of the Stockbridge and Munsee tribes ; and that the improvements made on the lands now in the possession of the said

406

TREATY WITH THE MENOMONIES. 1832 .

tribes on the east side of the Fox river, which said lands are to be re-
linquished shall, after being valued by a commissioner to be appointed by the President of the United States, be paid for by the Government : Provided, however, that the valuation of such improvements shall not exceed the sum of twenty-five thousand dollars. And that there shall be one township of land adjoining the foregoing, equal to twenty-three thousand and forty acres laid off and granted for the use of the Brothertown Indians , who are to be paid by the Government the sum of one thousand six hundred dollars for the improvements on the lands now in their possession , on the east side of Fox river, and which lands are to be relinquished by said Indians : also that a new line shall be run, parallel to the southwestern boundary line or course of the tract of five hundred thousand acres, described in the first article of this treaty , and set apart for the New York Indians, to commence at a point on the west side of the Fox river, and one mile above the Grand Shute, on Fox river, and at a sufficient distance from the said boundary line as established by the said first article, as shall comprehend the additional quantity of two hundred thousand acres of land on and along the west side of Fox river, without including any of the confirmed private land claims on the Fox river ; and which two hundred thousand acres shall
be a part of the five hundred thousand acres, intended to be set apart for the Six Nations of the New York Indians and the St. Regis tribe ; and that an equal quantity to that which is added to the southwestern side shall be taken off from the northeastern side of the said tract
described in that article, on the Oconto creek, to be determined by a commissioner to be appointed by the President of the United States ; so that the whole number of acres to be granted to the Six Nations, and St. Regis tribe of Indians, shall not exceed the quantity originally stipulated by the treaty." And whereas, before the treaty aforesaid, conditionally ratified , according to the proviso to the resolution of the Senate, above recited, could be obligatory upon the said Menominee nation, their assent to the same must be had and obtained.
And whereas the honorable Lewis Cass, Secretary of the Department of War, by his letter of instructions of the eleventh day of September, A. D. 1832, did authorize and request George B. Porter, Governor of the Territory of Michigan , to proceed to Green Bay, and endeavor to procure the assent of the Menominees to the change proposed by the Senate, as above set forth ; urging the necessity of directing his first efforts to an attempt to procure the unconditional assent of the Menominees to the said treaty, as ratified by the Senate. But should he fail in this object that he would then endeavor to procure their assent to the best practicable terms, short of those proposed by the Senate ; giving them to understand that he merely received such proposition as they might make, with a view to transmit it for the consideration of the President and Senate of the United States. And if this course became necessary that it would be very desirable that the New York Indians should also signify their acceptance of the modifications required by the Menominees.
And whereas, in pursuance of the said instructions the said George B. Porter proceeded to Green Bay and having assembled all the chiefs and headmen of the Menominee nation , in council, submitted to them,
on the twenty-second day of October A. D. one thousand eight hundred and thirty-two, the said proviso annexed to the resolution aforesaid of the Senate of the United States, for the ratification of the said treaty : and advised and urged on them the propriety of giving their assent to the same. And the said chiefs and headmen having taken time to de-
liberate and reflect on the proposition so submitted to them, and which they had been urged to assent to, did in the most positive and decided manner, refuse to give their assent to the same. (The many reasons

TREATY WITH THE MENOMONIES. 1832.

407

assigned for this determination, by them, being reported in the journal of the said commissioner, which will be transmitted with this agreement. )

And whereas after failing in the object last stated, the said George B. Porter endeavored to procure the assent of the said chiefs and headmen of the Menominee nation to the best practicable terms short of those proposed by the Senate ofthe United States ; and after much labor and pains, entreaty and persuasion, the said Menominees consented to the

following, as the modifications which they would make ; and which are reduced to writing, in the form of an agreement, as the best practicable terms which could be obtained from them, short of those proposed by the Senate of the United States, which they had previously positively refused to accede to. And as the modifications so made and desired,

have been acceded to by the New York Indians, with a request that the

treaty thus modified might be ratified and approved by the President and the Senate of the United States, it is the anxious desire of the

Menominees also, that the treaty, with these alterations may be ratified and approved without delay, that they may receive the benefits and advantage secured to them by the several stipulations of the said treaty, of which they have so long been deprived,

Objects.

The following is the article of agreement made between the said George B. Porter, commissioner on the part of the United States , spe-

confirmed private land claims on the Fox river. The lines of the said

tract of land so granted to be run, marked and laid off without delay,

by a commissioner to be appointed by the President of the United States.

And that in exchange for the above, a quantity of land equal to that which is added to the southwestern side shall be taken off from the

northeastern side of the said tract, described in that article, on the

Oconto creek, to be run , marked and determined by the commissioner

to be appointed by the President of the United States, as aforesaid, so

APPENDIX .
To all to whom these presents shall come, the undersigned, Chiefs and Oct. 27, 1832. Headmen of the sundry tribes of New York Indians, (as set forth in the specifications annexed to their signatures, ) send greeting :
Whereas a tedious, perplexing and harassing dispute and controversy have long existed between the Menominee nation of Indians and the New York Indians, more particularly known as the Stockbridge, Munsee and Brothertown tribes, the Six Nations and St. Regis tribe . The treaty made between the said Menominee nation , and the United States, and the conditional ratification thereof by the Senate of the United States, being stated and set forth in the within agreement, entered into between the chiefs and headmen of the said Menominees, and George B. Porter, Governor of Michigan , commissioner specially appointed, with instructions referred to in the said agreement. And whereas the undersigned are satisfied, and believe that the best efforts of the said
commissioner were directed and used to procure, if practicable, the unconditional assent of the said Menominees to the change proposed by the Senate of the United States in the ratification of the said treaty : but without success. And whereas the undersigned further believe that
the terms stated in the within agreement are the best practicable terms, short of those proposed by the Senate of the United States, which could be obtained from the said Menominees ; and being asked to signify our acceptance of the modifications proposed as aforesaid by the Menominees, we are compelled, by a sense of duty and propriety to say that we do hereby accept of the same. So far as the tribes to which we belong are concerned, we are perfectly satisfied , that the treaty should be rati-
fied on the terms proposed by the Menominees. We further believe that the tract of land which the Menominees in the within agreement, are willing to cede, in exchange for an equal quantity on the northeast side of the tract of five hundred thousand acres, contains a sufficient quantity of good land, favorably and advantageously situated, to answer all the wants of the New York Indians, and St. Regis tribe. For the Acceptance, purpose, then, of putting an end to strife, and that we may all sit down on the part of
the tribes intein peace and harmony, we thus signify our acceptance of the modifica- rested, of the tions proposed by the Menominees and we most respectfully request modifications that the treaty as now modified by the agreement this day entered into pMreonpoomsoednibeyst.he with the Menominees, may be ratified and approved by the President and Senate of the United States.

In witness whereof, we have hereunto set our hands and seals , at the Agency House at Green Bay, this twenty-seventh day of October, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and thirty-two.

Schermerhorn duly appointed Commissioners on the part ofthe United States and the undersigned Chiefs and Head-men ofthe Cherokee nation of Indians west ofthe Mississippi, they being duly authorized and empowered by their nation.

Preamble . Ante, p. 311.

WHEREAS articles of convention were concluded at the city of Washington, on the sixth day of May one thousand eight hundred and twentyeight, between James Barbour Secretary of War, being specially authorized therefor by the President of the United States, and the chiefs and head men of the Cheerokee nation of Indians west of the Mississippi, which articles of convention were duly ratified. And whereas it
was agreed by the second article of said convention as follows " That the United States agree to possess the Cheerokees, and to guarantee it to them forever, and that guarantee is solemnly pledged , of seven millions of acres of land, said land to be bounded as follows ; viz, commencing at a point on Arkansas river, where the eastern Choctaw boundary line strikes said river, and running thence with the western line of Arkansas Territory to the southwest corner of Missouri, and thence with the western boundary line of Missouri till it crosses the waters of Neasho, generally called Grand river, thence due west, to a point from which a due south course will strike the present northwest corner of Arkansas Territory, thence continuing due south on and with the present boundary line on the west of said Territory , to the main branch of Arkansas river, thence down said river to its junction with the Canadian, and thence up, and between said rivers Arkansas and Canadian to a point at which a line, running north and south, from river to river, will give the aforesaid seven millions of acres, thus provided for and bounded. The United States further guarantee to the Cherokee nation a perpetual outlet west, and a free and unmolested use of all the country lying west of the western boundary of the above-described limits ; and as far west, as the sovereignty of the United States and their right of soil extend. And whereas there was to said articles of convention and agreement, the following proviso viz. " Provided nevertheless, that said convention, shall not be so construed, as to extend the northern boundary of said perpetual outlet west, provided for and guarantied in the second article of said convention, north of the thirty-sixth degree of north latitude , or so as to interfere with the lands assigned, or to be assigned, west of the Mississippi river, to the Creek Indians who have emigrated, or may emigrate, from the States of Georgia and Alabama, under the provision of any treaty, or treaties, heretofore concluded, between the United States, and the Creek tribe of Indians  and provided further, that nothing in said convention , shall be construed, to cede, or assign, to the Cheerokees any lands heretofore ceded, or assigned, to any tribe, or tribes of Indians, by any treaty now existing and in force, with any such tribe or tribes."

that they had the right to select, and did select, a part of the country described within the boundaries mentioned above in said Cherokee articles of agreement- and whereas, both the Cheerokee and Creek nations of Indians west of the Mississippi, anxious to have their boundaries settled in an amicable manner, have met each other in council, and, after full deliberation mutually agreed upon the boundary lines between them- Now therefore, the United States on one part, and the chiefs and head-men of the Cherokee nation of Indians west of the
Mississippi on the other part, agree as follows :

ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT AND CONVENTION ,

Made and concluded at Fort Gibson, between Montfort Stokes, Henry L. Ellsworth and John F. Schermerhorn , Commissioners on the part of the United States, and the undersigned Chiefs and Head-men of the Muskogee or Creek nation of Indians, this 14th day of February, A. D. 1833.

Feb. 14, 1833. Proclamation, April 12, 1834.

WHEREAS, certain articles of a treaty were concluded at the City of

Washington, on the 24th day of January one thousand eight hundred

and twenty-six, by and between James Barbour, Secretary of War, on behalf of the United States, and the Chiefs and head-men of the Creek

nation of Indians ; by which it is agreed that the said Indians shall remove to a country west of the Mississippi river : and whereas the

sixth article of said treaty provides as follows :-" that a deputation of five persons shall be sent by them, (the Creek nation ) at the expense

of the United States , immediately after the ratification of the treaty, to

examine the country west of the Mississippi , not within the limits of the

States or Territories, and not possessed by the Choctaws or Cherokees. And the United States agree to purchase for them, if the same can con-

veniently be done upon reasonable terms, wherever they may select, a

country, whose extent shall in the opinion of the President, be proportioned to their numbers. And if such purchase cannot be thus made,

it is then agreed that the selection shall be made where the President may think proper, just reference being had to the wishes of the emi-

grating party." And whereas, the Creek Indians aforesaid , did send

five persons as delegates, to explore the country pointed out to them by

their treaty ; which delegates selected a country west of the Territory

of Arkansas, lying and being along and between the Verdigris, Arkansas, and Canadian rivers : and , to the country thus selected, a party of

the Creek Indians emigrated the following year. And whereas certain articles of treaty or convention, were concluded at the city of Wash-

ington on the 6th day of May, A. D. one thousand eight hundred and

twenty-eight, by and between James Barbour Secretary of War, on behalf of the United States, and certain chiefs and head-men of the

Cherokee nation of Indians ; by the second article of which convention, a country was assigned to the Cherokee Indians aforesaid, including

within its boundaries some of the lands previously selected and claimed

by the Creek Indians, under their treaty aforesaid . And whereas, the

President and Senate of the United States, for the purpose of protecting

the rights secured to the Creek Indians, by their treaty stipulations,

and with a view to prevent collision and misunderstanding between the two nations, ratified and confirmed the Cherokee treaty, on the 28th day of May, 1828, with the following proviso : viz.-" Provided, nevertheless, that the said convention shall not be so construed as to extend

the northern boundary of the perpetual outlet west, provided for and guarranteed in the second article of said convention, north of the 36th

deg. of north latitude, or so as to interfere with the lands assigned, or to be assigned, west of the Mississippi river to the Creek Indians , who have emigrated or may emigrate from the States of Georgia and Ala-

bama, under the provisions of any treaty or treaties heretofore concluded between the United States and the Creek tribe of Indians : And

provided further, that nothing in the said convention shall be construed

to cede or assign to the Cherokees any lands heretofore ceded or assigned to any tribe or tribes of Indians, by any treaty now existing and in force, with any such tribe or tribes." And whereas the said proviso and ratification of the Cherokee treaty, was accepted by the delegates of the nation, then at the City of Washington as satisfactory to them, as is shown in and by their certain instrument in writing, bearing date the 31st day of May 1828, appended to and published with their treaty aforesaid. But, afterwards, the Cherokees of Arkansas and many of those residing east of the Mississippi at the time that treaty was concluded, removed to the country described in the second article of their treaty and settled upon a certain portion of the land claimed by the Creek Indians under their treaty provisions and stipulations. And whereas difficulties and dissensions thus arose between the Cherokees and Creek tribes about their boundary lines, which occasioned an appeal to the President of the United States for his interposition, and final settlement of the question , which they were unable to settle between themselves. And whereas the commissioners of the United States,
whose names are signed hereto, in pursuance of the power and authority vested in them by the President of the United States, met the chiefs and head-men of the Cherokee and Creek nations of Indians, in council, on the 29th ultimo ; and after a full and patient hearing and careful examination of all the claims , set up and brought forward by both the contending parties, they have this day effected an adjustment of all their difficulties, and have succeeded in defining and establishing boundary lines to their country west of the Mississippi , which have been acknowledged , in open council, this day, to be mutually satisfactory to both nations.
Now, therefore, for the purpose of securing the great objects contemplated by an amicable settlement of the difficulties heretofore existing between the Cherokee and Muskogee or Creek Indians, so injurious to both parties ; and in order to establish boundary lines which will secure a country and permanent home to the whole Creek nation of Indians, including the Seminole nation who are anxious to join them, the undersigned commissioners, duly authorized to act on behalf of the United States, and the chiefs and head-men of the said Muskogee or Creek Indians, having full power and authority to act for their people west of the Mississippi, hereby agree to the following articles :
ART. I. The Muskogee or Creek nation of Indians, west of the Mississippi declare themselves to be the friends and allies of the United States, under whose parental care and protection they desire to continue : and that they are anxious to live in peace and friendship not only with their near neighbors and brothers, the Cherokees, but with all the surrounding tribes of Indians.

Bounds of the grants to the Creeks.

ART. II. The United States hereby agree, by and with the consent of the Creek and Cherokee delegates, this day obtained , that the Muskogee or Creek country west of the Mississippi, shall be embraced within the following boundaries, viz :-Beginning at the mouth of the north fork of the Canadian river, and run northerly four miles-thence running a straight line so as to meet a line drawn from the south bank of the Arkansas river opposite to the east or lower bank of Grand river, at its junction with the Arkansas, and which runs a course south, 44 deg. west, one mile , to a post placed in the ground- thence along said line to the Arkansas, and up the same and the Verdigris river, to where the old territorial line crosses it-thence along said line north to a point twenty-five miles from the Arkansas river where the old territorial line crosses the same-thence running a line at right angles with the territorial line aforesaid, or west, to the Mexico line-thence along the said line southerly to the Canadian river or to the boundary of the Choctaw

country-thence down said river to the place of beginning. The lines, hereby defining the country of the Muskogee Indians on the north and east, bound the country of the Cherokees along these courses, as settled by the treaty concluded this day between the United States and that tribe.

ART. III. The United States will grant a patent, in fee simple, to the Creek nation of Indians for the land assigned said nation by this treaty or convention, whenever the same shall have been ratified by the President and Senate of the United States- and the right thus guarranteed by the United States shall be continued to said tribe of Indians, so long as they shall exist as a nation, and continue to occupy the country hereby assigned them .

upon the land, as the great body of said nation who still remain on the

east side of the Mississippi : and it is also understood and agreed that the Seminole Indians of Florida, whose removal to this country is pro-
vided for by their treaty with the U. S. dated May 9th , 1832, shall also

as the country of the Creek nation : and they (the Seminoles) will hereafter be considered a constituent part of said nation , but are to be located

on some part of the Creek country by themselves-which location will

be selected for them by the commissioners who have signed these articles of agreement or convention.

ART. 5. As an evidence of the kind feeling of the United States Additional

towards the Muskogee Indians, and as a testimonial of the [their ] grati- blacksmith, & c.
fication with the present amicable and satisfactory adjustment of their tboybUe.fuSr.nished difficulties with the Cherokees, experienced by the commissioners, they

agree on behalf of the United States, to furnish to the Creek Indians west of the Mississippi, one blacksmith and one wheelwright or wagon-

maker, as soon as they may be required by the nation, in addition to those already employed - also, to erect shops and furnish tools for the

same, and supply the smith shops with one ton of iron and two hundred and fifty pounds of steel each ; and allow the said Creek Indians, annually, for education purposes, the sum of one thousand dollars, to be expended under the direction of the President of the United Statesthe whole of the above grants to be continued so long as the President may consider them conducive to the interest and welfare of the Creek Indians : And the United States will also cause to be erected, as soon

as conveniently can be done, four patent rail way mills, for grinding corn ; and will immediately purchase for them twenty-four.cross-cut saws. It being distinctly understood, however, that the grants thus

made to the Creek Indians, by this article, are intended solely for the use and benefit of that portion of the Creek nation, who are now settled

west of the Mississippi.

ART. VI. The United States agree that the improvements which the Creek Indians may be required to leave, in consequence of the boundary lines this day settled between their people and the Cherokees, shall be valued with as little delay as possible, and a fair and reasonable price paid for the same by the United States.

FATHER : Feeling a disposition to comply with the resolution of Senate of the United States, and the views of the Government in relation to an alteration in the boundaries of the country ceded to the United nation of Chippewa, Ottawa, and Potawatamie Indians at the treaty at Chicago in the State of Illinois , concluded on the 26th and 27th days of September 1833 :-we therefore propose as the chiefs of the said united nation, and for and on their behalf that we will accept of the following alteration in the boundaries of the said tract of country viz :-Beginning
at the mouth of Boyer's river ; thence down the Missouri river, to a point thereon ; from which a due east line would strike the northwest corner of the State of Missouri ; thence along the said east line, to the

TREATY WITH THE CHIPPEWAS, ETC. 1833.

447

northwest corner of said State ; then along the northern boundary line of the said State of Missouri , till it strikes the line of the lands of the Sac and Fox Indians ; thence northwardly along said line to a point from which a west line would strike the sources of the Little Sioux river ; thence along said west line, till it strikes the said sources of said river ; then down said river to its mouth ; thence down the Missouri river, to the place of beginning : Provided the said boundary shall contain five million of acres ; but should it contain more, then said boundaries are to be reduced so as to contain the said five millions of acres.
And, in consideration of the alteration of said boundary we ask that ten thousand dollars should be paid to such commissioner, as shall be designated by us to receive the same west of the Mississippi river, at such place on the tract of country ceded to the said united nation as we may designate, and to be applied, as we may direct for the use and benefit of the said nation. And the further sum of two thousand dol-
lars to be paid to Gholson Kercheval, of Chicago, Ill : for services rendered the said united nation of Indians during the late war, between the U. S. Government and the Sacs and Foxes ; and the further sum
of one thousand dollars to George E. Walker for services rendered the said United nation, in bringing Indian prisoners, from west of the Mississippi river to Ottawa, Laselle county, Ill. for whose appearance at the circuit court of said county, the said nation was bound.
The foregoing propositions are made with the expectation, that with the exception of the alteration in the proposed boundary, and the indemnity herein demanded as an equivalent for said exchange, the whole of the treaty made and concluded at this place on the 26th and 27th days of September 1833, be ratified as made and concluded at that time, within the space of five months from the present date ; otherwise it is our wish that the whole of the said treaty should be considered as cancelled.

In witness whereof, we, the undersigned chiefs of the said united nation of Chippewa, Ottowa and Potawatamie Indians, being specially delegated with power and authority to effect this negotiation , have hereto set our hands and seals at Chicago in the State of Illinois, on the first day of October, A. D. , 1834.

Proclamation, July 1, 1834.

Peace and friendship,
Indians about to remove, are to be protected by U. S.

ART. I. It is agreed that perpetual amity, peace and friendship, shall exist between the United States, and the Chickasaw nation of Indians.
ART. II. The Chickasaws are about to abandon their homes, which they have long cherished and loved ; and though hitherto unsuccessful, they still hope to find a country, adequate to the wants and support of their people, somewhere west of the Mississippi and within the territorial limits of the United States ; should they do so, the Government of the United States, hereby consent to protect and defend them against the inroads of any other tribe of Indians, and from the whites ; and agree to keep them without the limits of any State or Territory. The Chickasaws pledge themselves never to make war upon any Indian people, or upon the whites, unless they are so authorised by the United States. But if war be made upon them, they will be permitted to defend themselves, until assistance, be given to them by the United States, as shall be the case.

U. S. to pre-
vent intrusions on their lands.

ART. III. The Chickasaws are not acquainted with the laws of the whites, which are extended over them ; and the many intruders which break into their country, interupting their rights and disturbing their repose, leave no alternative whereby restraint can be afforded, other than an appeal to the military force of the country, which they are unwilling to ask for, or see resorted to ; and therefore they agree to forbear such a request, for prevention of this great evil, with the understanding, which is admitted, that the agent of the United States, upon

TREATY WITH THE CHICKASAWS . 1834.

451

the application of the chiefs of the nation , will resort to every legal civil remedy, (at the expense of the United States, ) to prevent intrusions upon the ceded country ; and to restrain and remove trespassers from any selected reservations, upon application of the owner of the same. And it is also agreed, that the United States, will continue some discreet person as agent, such as they now have, to whom they can look for redress of wrongs and injuries which may be attempted against them ; and it is consented, that if any of their property, be taken by persons of the United States, covertly or forcibly, the agent on satisfactory and just complaint being made, shall pursue all lawful civil means, which the laws of the State permit, in which the wrong is done, to regain the same, or to obtain a just remuneration ; and on failure or inability to procure redress, for the offended, against the offending party ; payment for the loss sustained, on production of the record, and certificate of the facts, by the agent, shall be made by the United States ; but in all such cases, satisfactory proof, for the establishing of the claim, shall be offered.
ART. IV. The Chickasaws desire to have within their own direction Under what and control, the means of taking care of themselves. Many of their avuatthioornistmy aryesbere people are quite competent to manage their affairs, though some are not sold. capable, and might be imposed upon by designing persons ; it is therefore agreed that the reservations hereinafter admitted, shall not be permitted to be sold, leased , or disposed of unless it appear by the certificate of at least two of the following persons, to wit : Ish-ta-ho-ta-pa the King, Levi Colbert, George Colbert, Martin Colbert, Isaac Alberson , Henry Love, and Benj. Love, of which five have affixed their names to this treaty, that the party owning or claiming the same, is capable to manage, and to take care of his or her affairs ; which fact, to the best of his knowledge and information, shall be certified by the agent ; and furthermore that a fair consideration has been paid ; and thereupon, the deed of conveyance shall be valid provided the President of the United States, or such other person as he may designate shall approve ofthe same, and endorse it on the deed ; which said deed and approval, shall be registered, at the place, and within the time, required by the laws of the State, in which the land may be situated ; otherwise to be void. And
where such certificate is not obtained ; upon the recommendation of a majority of the Delegation , and the approval of the agent, at the discretion of the President of the United States, the same may be sold ; but the consideration thereof, shall remain as part of the general Chickasaw fund in the hands of the Government, until such time as the chiefs in council shall think it advisable to pay it to the claimant or to those, who may rightfully claim under said claimant , and shall so recommend it. And as the King, Levi Colbert, and the Delegation , who have signed this agreement, and to whom certain important and interesting duties purtaining to the nation, are assigned , may die, resign , or remove, so that their people may be without the benefit of their services, it is stipulated, that as often as any vacancy happens, by death, resignation, or otherwise, the chiefs shall select some discrete person of their nation to fill the occurring vacancy, who, upon a certificate of qualification , discretion and capability, by the agent, shall be appointed by the Secretary of War ; whereupon , he shall possess all the authority granted to those who are here named, and the nation will make to the person so appointed, such reasonable compensation , as they with the assent of the agent and the Secretary of War, may think right, proper and reasonable to be allowed.
ART. V. It is agreed that the fourth article of the " Treaty of Pon- Grants to be titock," be so changed , that the following reservations be granted in tinerfmeein;ehd.owdefee:-To heads of families, being Indians, or having Indian families, Ante, p. 381 .

Where any white man, before the date hereof has married an Indian woman, the reservation he may be entitled to under this treaty, she being alive, shall be in her name, and no right of alienation of the same shall purtain to the husband unless he divest her of the title, after the mode and manner that feme coverts, usually divest themselves of title to real estate, that is, by the acknowledgment of the wife which may be taken before the Agent, and certified by him, that she

consents to the sale freely, and without compulsion from her husband, who shall at the same time certify that the head of such family is prudent, and competent to care of and manage his affairs ; otherwise the proceeds of said sale shall be subject to the provisions and restrictions contained in the fourth article of this agreement.

These lands may be sold upon a recom-
mendation of a majority of the seven persons, heretofore named in this agreement, setting forth that it will prove advantageous to the parties interested ; subject however, to the approval of the President, or such other person as he shall designate.

ART. I. It is represented that the old chiefs Levi Colbert and Isaac
Alberson, who have rendered many and valuable services to their nation, desire on account of their health, to visit some watering place, during the present year, for recovery and restoration ; it is agreed that there be paid to the agent for these purposes, and to discharge some debts which are due and owing from the nation, the sum of three thousand dollars, out of the appropriation of one thousand eight hundred and thirty-three, for carrying into effect the " treaty of Pontitock," which said sum so far as used is to be hereafter reimbursed to the nation, by said Levi Colbert and Isaac Alberson , and by the nation to the United States, as other advances are to be reimbursed , from the sale of their lands.

Children to be eUdnuictaetdedStiantetsh.e

ART. II. The Chickasaw people express a desire that the Government shall at the expense of the United States, educate some of their children, and they urge the justice of their application, on the ground, that they have ever been faithful and friendly to the people of this country,that they have never raised the tomahawk , to shed the blood of an American, and have given up heretofore to their white brothers, extensive and valuable portions of their country , at a price wholly inconsiderable and inadequate ; and from which the United States have derived great wealth and important advantages ; therefore, with the advice and consent of the President and Senate of the United States, it is consented , that

three thousand dollars for fifteen years, be appropriated and applied under the direction of the Secretary of War, for the education and instruction within the United States, of such children male and female or either, as the seven persons named in the treaty to which this is a supplement, and their successors, with the approval of the agent, from time to time may select and recommend.

ART. III. The Chickasaw nation desire to close finally, all the business they have on the east side of the Mississippi , that their Great Father, may be no more troubled with their complaints, and to this end, they ask the Government to receive from them a tract of land, of four miles

A former reservation ceded to U.S.

square, heretofore reserved under the 4th article of their " Treaty of 1818," and to pay them within three months, from the date of this arrangement, the Government price of one dollar and a quarter per acre, for said reserve ; and accordingly the same is agreed to, provided a satisfactory relinquishment of title from the parties interested, be filed with the Secretary of War, previous to said payment being made.

ART. V. The Chickasaw people are aware that one clerk is insufficient to the bringing of their lands early into market ; and rather than
encounter the delay which must ensue, they prefer the increased expense of an additional one. It is therefore stipulated that the President shall

appoint another clerk, at the same annual compensation, agreed upon

by the " Treaty of Pontitock ;" who shall be paid after the manner prescribed therein. But whenever the President shall be of opinion that the services of any officer employed under this treaty, for the sale of

ARTICLES OF A TREATY ,

Dec. 29, 1835.
Proclamation , May 23, 1836 .

Concluded at New Echota in the State of Georgia on the 29th day of Decr. 1835 by General William Carroll and John F. Schermerhorn commissioners on the part of the United States and the Chiefs Head Men and People of the Cherokee tribe of Indians.

Preamble.

WHEREAS the Cherokees are anxious to make some arrangements with the Government of the United States whereby the difficulties they have experienced by a residence within the settled parts of the United States under the jurisdiction and laws of the State Governments may be terminated and adjusted ; and with a view to reuniting their people in one body and securing a permanent home for themselves and their posterity in the country selected by their forefathers without the territorial limits of the State sovereignties, and where they can establish and enjoy a government of their choice and perpetuate such a state of society as may be most consonant with their views , habits and condition ; and as may tend to their individual comfort and their advancement in civilization .
And whereas a delegation ofthe Cherokee nation composed of Messrs. John Ross Richard Taylor Danl . McCoy Samuel Gunter and William Rogers with full power and authority to conclude a treaty with the United States did on the 28th day of February 1835 stipulate and agree with the Government of the United States to submit to the Senate to fix the amount which should be allowed the Cherokees for their claims
and for a cession of their lands east of the Mississippi river, and did agree to abide by the award of the Senate of the United States themselves and to recommend the same to their people for their final determination.
And whereas on such submission the Senate advised " that a sum not
exceeding five millions of dollars be paid to the Cherokee Indians for all their lands and possessions east of the Mississippi river."
And whereas this delegation after said award of the Senate had been made, were called upon to submit propositions as to its disposition to be arranged in a treaty which they refused to do, but insisted that the same " should be referred to their nation and there in general council
to deliberate and determine on the subject in order to ensure harmony and good feeling among themselves."
And whereas a certain other delegation composed of John Ridge Elias Boudinot Archilla Smith S. W. Bell John West Wm. A. Davis
and Ezekiel West, who represented that portion of the nation in favor of emigration to the Cherokee country west of the Mississippi entered into propositions for a treaty with John F. Schermerhorn commissioner on the part of the United States which were to be submitted to their nation for their final action and determination :
And whereas the Cherokee people, at their last October council at Red Clay, fully authorized and empowered a delegation or committee of twenty persons of their nation to enter into and conclude a treaty with the United States commissioner then present, at that place or elsewhere and as the people had good reason to believe that a treaty would then and there be made or at a subsequent council at New Echota which the commissioners it was well known and understood , were authorized
(478)

479

and instructed to convene for said purpose ; and since the said delegation have gone on to Washington city, with a view to close negotiations there, as stated by them notwithstanding they were officially informed by the United States commissioner that they would not be received by the President of the United States ; and that the Government would transact no business of this nature with them , and that if a treaty was made it must be done here in the nation, where the delegation at Washington last winter urged that it should be done for the purpose of promoting peace and harmony among the people ; and since these facts have also been corroborated to us by a communication recently received by the commissioner from the Government of the United States and read and explained to the people in open council and therefore believing said delegation can effect nothing and since our difficulties are daily increasing and our situation is rendered more and more precarious uncertain and insecure in consequence of the legislation of the States ; and seeing no effectual way of relief, but in accepting the liberal overtures ofthe United States.
And whereas Genl William Carroll and John F. Schermerhorn were
appointed commissioners on the part of the United States, with full power and authority to conclude a treaty with the Cherokees east and
were directed by the President to convene the people of the nation in general council at New Echota and to submit said propositions to them with power and authority to vary the same so as to meet the views of the Cherokees in reference to its details.
And whereas the said commissioners did appoint and notify a general council of the nation to convene at New Echota on the 21st day of December 1835 ; and informed them that the commissioners would be prepared to make a treaty with the Cherokee people who should assemble there and those who did not come they should conclude gave their assent and sanction to whatever should be transacted at this council and
the people having met in council according to said notice. Therefore the following articles of a treaty are agreed upon and con-
cluded between William Carroll and John F. Schermerhorn commis-
sioners on the part of the United States and the chiefs and head men and people of the Cherokee nation in general council assembled this 29th day of Decr 1835.

ARTICLE 1. The Cherokee nation hereby cede relinquish and convey Cherokees re-

to the United States all the lands owned claimed or possessed by them east of the Mississippi river, and hereby release all their claims upon
the United States for spoliations of every kind for and in consideration of the sum of five millions of dollars to be expended paid and invested in the manner stipulated and agreed upon in the following articles But as a question has arisen between the commissioners and the Cherokees whether the Senate in their resolution by which they advised " that a sum not exceeding five millions of dollars be paid to the Cherokee In-

laillnqtuhiesihr tloanUd.sS. east of the Mississippi.

dians for all their lands and possessions east of the Mississippi river" have included and made any allowance or consideration for claims for spoiliations it is therefore agreed on the part of the United States that this question shall be again submitted to the Senate for their considera-

tion and decision and if no allowance was made for spoiliations that then an additional sum of three hundred thousand dollars be allowed for the same.

ARTICLE 2. Whereas by the treaty of May 6th 1828 and the supplementary treaty thereto of Feb. 14th 1833 with the Cherokees west of
the Mississippi the United States guarantied and secured to be conveyed by patent, to the Cherokee nation of Indians the following tract of country " Beginning at a point on the old western territorial line of

ries. In addition to the seven millions of acres of land thus provided for and bounded, the United States further guaranty to the Cherokee nation a perpetual outlet west, and a free and unmolested use of all the country west of the western boundary of said seven millions of acres, as far west as the sovereignty of the United States and their right of soil extend :
Provided however That if the saline or salt plain on the western prairie shall fall within said limits prescribed for said outlet, the right is reserved to the United States to permit other tribes of red men to get salt on said plain in common with the Cherokees ; And letters pattent shall be issued by the United States as soon as practicable for the land hereby guarantied."
And whereas it is apprehended by the Cherokees that in the above cession there is not contained a sufficient quantity of land for the accommodation of the whole nation on their removal west of the Mississippi the United States in consideration of the sum of five hundred thousand
dollars therefore hereby covenant and agree to convey to the said Indians, and their descendants by patent, in fee simple the following additional tract of land situated between the west line of the State of Missouri and the Osage reservation beginning at the southeast corner of the same and runs north along the east line of the Osage lands fifty miles to the northeast corner thereof; and thence east to the west line of the State of Missouri ; thence with said line south fifty miles ; thence west to the place of beginning ; estimated to contain eight hundred thousand acres of land ; but it is expressly understood that if any of the lands assigned the Quapaws shall fall within the aforesaid bounds the same shall be reserved and excepted out of the lands above granted and a pro rata reduction shall be made in the price to be allowed to the United States for the same by the Cherokees.

ARTICLE 3. The United States also agree that the lands above ceded by the treaty of Feb. 14 1833, including the outlet, and those ceded by this treaty shall all be included in one patent executed to the Cherokee nation of Indians by the President of the United States according to the provisions of the act of May 28 1830. It is, however, agreed that the military reservation at Fort Gibson shall be held by the United States. But should the United States abandon said post and have no further use for the same it shall revert to the Cherokee nation. The United States shall always have the right to make and establish such post and military

ARTICLE 4. The United States also stipulate and agree to extinguish Osage titles to for the benefit of the Cherokees the titles to the reservations within their reservations to

belong or have been assigned or to their agents or guardians whenever
they shall execute after the ratification of this treaty a satisfactory conveyance for the same, to the United States, the sum of fifteen thousand

dollars according to a schedule accompanying this treaty of the relative value of the several reservations.

And whereas by the several treaties between the United States and seMrivsastiioonnasrtyorbeethe Osage Indians the Union and Harmony Missionary reservations paid for. which were established for their benefit are now situated within the

country ceded by them to the United States ; the former being situated in the Cherokee country and the latter in the State of Missouri. It is therefore agreed that the United States shall pay the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions for the improvements on the same what they shall be appraised at by Capt. Geo. Vashon Cherokee sub-agent Abraham Redfield and A. P. Chouteau or such persons as the President of the United States shall appoint and the money allowed for the same shall be expended in schools among the Osages and improving their condition. It is understood that the United States are to pay the amount allowed for the reservations in this article and not the Cherokees.

ARTICLE 5. The United States hereby covenant and agree that the Lands perma-

lands ceded to the Cherokee nation in the foregoing

article shall, in no

carry into effect all such laws as they may deem necessary for the government and protection of the persons and property within their own country belonging to their people or such persons as have connected themselves with them : provided always that they shall not be inconsistent with the constitution of the United States and such acts of Con-

gress as have been or may be passed regulating trade and intercourse with the Indians ; and also, that they shall not be considered as extend-

ing to such citizens and army of the United States as may travel or reside in the Indian country by permission according to the laws and regulations established by the Government of the same.

ARTICLE 6. Perpetual peace and friendship shall exist between the Peace to be citizens of the United States and the Cherokee Indians. The United preserved.

States, who may attempt to settle in the country without their consent ;

and all such persons shall be removed from the same by order of the President of the United States. But this is not intended to prevent the

residence among them of useful farmers mechanics and teachers for the

instruction of Indians according to treaty stipulations.

include the objects herein specified that in that case such further provision should be made therefor as might appear to the Senate to be just.

ARTICLE SIXTH. The said Indians being desirous of making provi-
sion for their half-breed relatives, and the President having determined, that individual reservations shall not be granted, it is agreed, that in lieu thereof, the sum of one hundred and fifty thousand dollars shall be set apart as a fund for said half-breeds. No person shall be entitled to any part of said fund, unless he is of Indian descent and actually resident within the boundaries described in the first article of this treaty, nor shall any thing be allowed to any such person , who may have received any allowance at any previous Indian treaty. The following principles, shall regulate the distribution . A census shall be taken of all the men, women, and children , coming within this article. As the Indians hold in higher consideration , some of their half-breeds than others, and as there is much difference in their capacity to use and take care of property, and, consequently, in their power to aid their Indian connexions, which furnishes a strong ground for this claim, it is, therefore, agreed, that at the council to be held upon this subject, the commissioner shall call upon the Indian chiefs to designate, if they require it, three classes of these claimants, the first of which, shall receive onehalf more than the second, and the second, double the third. Each man woman and child shall be enumerated , and an equal share, in the respective classes, shall be allowed to each. If the father is living with the family, he shall receive the shares of himself, his wife and children . If the father is dead , or separated from the family, and the mother is living with the family, she shall have her own share, and that of the children. If the father and mother are neither living with the family, or if the children are orphans, their share shall be retained till they are twenty-one years of age ; provided, that such portions of it as may be necessary may, under the direction of the President, be from time to time applied for their support. All other persons at the age of twentyone years, shall receive their shares agreeably to the proper class. Out of the said fund of one hundred and fifty thousand dollars, the sum of five thousand dollars shall be reserved to be applied , under the direction of the President, to the support of such of the poor half breeds, as may require assistance, to be expended in annual instalments for the term of ten years, commencing with the second year. Such of the half-
breeds, as may be judged incapable of making a proper use of the money, allowed them by the commissioner, shall receive the same in instalments, as the President may direct.

Provision for half-breeds, &c.

ARTICLE SEVENTH. In consideration of the cessions above made, and Two additional

as a further earnest of the

disposition felt to do full justice to the In-

blacksmiths, & c.

dians, and to further their well being, the United States engage to keep

two additional blacksmith-shops , one of which, shall be located on the reservation north of Grand river, and the other at the Sault Ste. Marie.

A permanent interpreter will be provided at each of these locations. It

is stipulated to renew the present dilapidated shop at Michilimackinac,

and to maintain a gunsmith , in addition to the present smith's establish-

ment, and to build a dormitory for the Indians visiting the post, and appoint a person to keep it, and supply it with fire-wood. It is also

agreed, to support two farmers and assistants, and two mechanics , as

the President may designate, to teach and aid the Indians, in agriculture, and the mechanic arts. The farmers and mechanics, and the dor-

mitory, will be continued for ten years, and as long thereafter, as the

President may deem this arrangement useful and necessary ; but the benefits of the other stipulations of this article, shall be continued beyond the expiration of the annuities, and it is understood that the whole

of this article shall stand in force, and inure to the benefit of the Indians,

as long after the expiration of the twenty years as Congress may appro-
priate for the objects. 2R

Ante, p. 431.

ARTICLE EIGHTH. It is agreed, that as soon as the said Indians desire it, a deputation shall be sent to the west of the Mississippi , and to the country between Lake Superior and the Mississippi, and a suitable location shall be provided for them, among the Chippewas, if they desire it, and it can be purchased upon reasonable terms, and if not, then in some portion of the country west of the Mississippi, which is at the disposal of the United States. Such improvements as add value to the land, hereby ceded, shall be appraised, and the amount paid to the proper Indian. But such payment shall , in no case, be assigned to, or paid to, a white man. If the church on the Cheboigan, should fall within this cession , the value shall be paid to the band owning it. The mission establishments upon the Grand river shall be appraised and the value paid to the proper boards. When the Indians wish it, the United States will remove them, at their expence, provide them a year's subsistence in the country to which they go, and furnish the same articles and equipments to each person as are stipulated to be given to the Pottowatomies in the final treaty of cession concluded at Chicago.

Payment to half-breeds in lieu of reserva-
tions.

ARTICLE NINTH. Whereas the Ottawas and Chippewas, feeling a
strong consideration for aid rendered by certain of their half-breeds on Grand river, and other parts of the country ceded, and wishing to testify their gratitude on the present occasion , have assigned such individuals certain locations of land , and united in a strong appeal for the allowance of the same in this treaty ; and whereas no such reservations can be permitted in carrying out the special directions of the President on this subject, it is agreed, that, in addition to the general fund set apart for half-breed claims, in the sixth article, the sum of forty-eight thousand one hundred and forty-eight dollars shall be paid for the extinguishment of this class of claims, to be divided in the following manner : To Rix Robinson, in lieu of a section of land , granted to his Indian family, on the Grand river rapids, ( estimated by good judges to be worth half a million,) at the rate of thirty-six dollars an acre : To Leonard Slater, in trust for Chiminonoquat, for a section of land above said rapids, at the rate of ten dollars an acre : To John A. Drew, for a tract of one section and three quarters, to his Indian family, at Cheboigan rapids, at the rate of four dollars ; to Edward Biddle, for one section to his Indian family at the fishing grounds, at the rate of three dollars : To John Holiday, for five sections of land to five persons of his Indian family, at the rate of one dollar and twenty-five cents ; to Eliza Cook, Sophia Biddle, and Mary Holiday, one section of land each, at two dollars and fifty cents : To Augustin Hamelin junr, being of Indian descent, two sections, at one dollar and twenty-five cents ; to William Lasley, Joseph Daily, Joseph Trotier, Henry A. Levake, for two sections each, for their Indian families, at one dollar and twenty-five cents : To Luther

during the late war, and suffered much in consequence of his sentiments, it is agreed, that an annuity of one hundred dollars per annum shall be paid to Ningweegon or the Wing, during his natural life, in money or goods, as he may choose. Another of the chiefs of said nation, who

CONVENTION WITH THE SIOUX OF WA- HA- SHAW'S TRIBE.
In a convention held this tenth day of September 1836, between Col. Z. Taylor Indian Agent, and the chiefs, braves, and principal men of the Sioux of Wa-ha-shaw's tribe of Indians, it has been represented, that according to the stipulations of the first article of the treaty of Prairie du Chien , of the 15th July 1830, the country thereby ceded is "to be assigned and allotted under the direction of the President ofthe United States, to the tribes now living thereon , or to such other tribes as the President may locate thereon for hunting and other purposes." and, whereas , it is further represented to us, the chiefs, braves, and principal men of the tribe aforesaid, to be desirable that the lands lying between the State of Missouri and the Missouri river should be attached to, and become a part of said State, and the Indian title thereto be extinguished but that, notwithstanding, as these lands compose a part of the country embraced by the provisions of said first article of the treaty aforesaid, the stipulations thereof will be strictly observed , until the assent of the Indians interested , is given to the proposed measure.

CONVENTION WITH THE SAC AND FOX TRIBE.

Proclamation , Feb. 15 , 1837. Ante, p. 328.
Lands ceded to U. S.

In a convention held this twenty-seventh day of September 1836, between Henry Dodge Superintendant of Indian Affairs, and the chiefs, braves, and principal men of the Sac and Fox tribe of Indians, it has been represented, that according to the stipulations of the first article of the treaty of Prairie du Chien, of the 15th July 1830, the country thereby ceded, is " to be assigned and allotted under the direction of the President of the United States, to the tribes now living thereon, or to such other tribes as the President may locate thereon for hunting and other purposes." And , whereas, it is further represented to us, the chiefs , braves, and principal men of the tribe aforesaid , to be desirable that the lands lying between the State of Missouri and the Missouri river should be attached to, and become a part of said State, and the Indian title thereto be entirely extinguished ; but that, notwithstanding, as these lands compose a part of the country embraced by the provisions of said first article of the treaty aforesaid, the stipulations thereof will be strictly observed until the assent of the Indians interested is given to the proposed measure.
Now, we the chiefs, braves, and principal men of the Sac and Fox tribes of Indians, fully understanding the subject , and well satisfied from the local position of the lands in question , that they can never be made available for Indian purposes, and that an attempt to place an Indian population on them must inevitably lead to collisions with the citizens of the United States ; and further believing that the extension of the State line in the direction indicated , would have a happy effect, by presenting a natural boundary between the whites and Indians ; and, willing moreover, to give the United States a renewed evidence of our

attachment and friendship , do hereby, for ourselves, and on behalf of our respective tribes (having full power and authority to this effect) forever cede, relinquish, and quit claim to the United States, all our right, title, and interest of whatsoever nature in, and to , the lands lying between the State of Missouri and the Missouri river , and do freely and fully exonerate the United States from any guarantee, condition , or limitation, expressed or implied, under the treaty of Prairie du Chien aforesaid, or otherwise , as to the entire and absolute disposition of the said lands, fully authorizing the United States to do with the same whatever shall seem expedient or necessary.

Entered into and concluded at Bellevue Upper Missouri thefifteenth day of October one thousand eight hundred and thirty-six, by and between John Dougherty U. S. agt. for Indian Affairs and Joshua Pilcher U. S. Ind. s. agt being specially authorized therefor ; and the chiefs braves head men &c of the Otoes Missouries Omahaws and Yankton and Santee bands of Sioux, duly authorized by their respective tribes.

Treaty ofJuly ARTICLE 1st. Whereas it has been represented that according to the 15, 1830.
Ante, p. 328. stipulations of the first article of the treaty of Prairie du Chien of the fifteenth of July eighteen hundred and thirty, the country ceded is " to be assigned and allotted under the direction of the President of the United States to the tribes now living thereon or to such other tribes as the President may locate thereon for hunting and other purposes," and whereas it is further represented to us the chiefs, braves and head men of the tribes aforesaid, that it is desirable that the lands lying between the State of Missouri and the Missouri river, and south of a line running due west from the northwest corner of said State until said line strikes the Missouri river, should be attached to and become a part of said State, and the Indian title thereto be entirely extinguished ; but that notwithstanding, as these lands compose a part of the country embraced by the provisions of the said first article of the treaty aforesaid, the stipulations whereof will be strictly observed, until the assent of the Indians interested is given to the proposed measure. Now we the chiefs braves and principal men of the Otoes Missouries Omahaws Yankton and Santee bands of Sioux aforesaid fully understanding the subject and well satisfied from the local position of the lands in question, that they never can be made available for Indian purposes ; and that an attempt to place an Indian population on them must inevitably lead to collisions with the citizens of the United States ; and, further believing that the extension of the State line in the direction indicated, would have a happy effect by presenting a natural boundary between the whites and Indians ; and willing moreover to give the United States a renewed

relinquishment ; and as some compensation for the great sacrifice made by the several deputations at this particular season, by abandoning their fall hunts and traveling several hundred miles to attend this convention the undersigned John Dougherty and Joshua Pilcher agrees on behalf of the United States to pay as a present to the tribes herein before named the sum of four thousand five hundred and twenty dollars in merchandize, the receipt of which they hereby acknowledge having been distributed among them in the proportions following. To the Otoes Portions of twelve hundred and fifty dollars, to the Missouries one thousand dollars each tribe .
to the Omahaws twelve hundred and seventy dolls. to the Yankton and Santee bands of Sioux one thousand dollars.

ART. 3d. In consequence of the removal of the Otoes and Missou-
ries from their former situation on the river Platte to the place selected for them, and of their having to build new habitations last spring at the time which should have been occupied in attending to their crops, it appears that they have failed to such a degree as to make it certain that they will lack the means of subsisting next spring, when it will be necessary for them to commence cultivating the lands now preparing for their use. It is therefore agreed that the said Otoes, and Missouries (in addition to the presents herein before mentioned ) shall be furnished at the expence of the United States with five hundred bushels of corn to be delivered at their village in the month of April next. And the same causes operating upon the Omahaws, they having also abandoned their former situation , and established at the place recommended to them on the Missouri river, and finding it difficult without the aid of ploughs to cultivate land near there village where they would be secure from their enemies, it is agreed as a farther proof of the liberality of the Government and its disposition to advance such tribes in the cultivation of the soil as may manifest a disposition to rely on it for the future means of subsistence ; that they shall have one hundred acres of ground broke up and put under a fence near their village, so soon as it can be done after the ratification of this convention , and that there shall be a suitable person employed as farmer to assist and instruct them in cultivating the soil so soon and for such time as the President of the United States may deem proper. *

The undersigned chiefs braves and head men of the Compensation tribes herein before named, feeling sensible of the many acts of kind- to certain perness and liberality manifested towards them, and their respective tribes sons. by their good friends Joseph Roubadoux sen . , and Lucien Fontenelle , during an intercourse of many years ; aware of the heavy losses sustained by them at different times by their liberality in extending large credits to them and their people, which have never been paid, and which (owing to the impoverished situation of their country and their scanty means of living) never can be ; are anxious to evince some evidence of gratitude for such benefits and favours, and compensate the said individuals in some measure for their losses. To this end at the earnest
solicitation of said tribes it is agreed that the said Joseph Roubadoux sen.shall have the privilege of selecting three sections of land any where within the ceded territory so soon as the same shall be surveyed, and the said Lucien Fontenelle shall be permitted to select two sections in like manner which shall be conveyed to them by the United States without cost, whenever the land so selected shall be reported by them there agents or legal representatives to the register and receiver of the land office of the district in which they lie.

President may locate thereon for hunting and other purposes." And,

whereas, it is further represented to us, the chiefs, braves and principal

men of the tribes aforesaid, to be desirable, that the lands lying between the State of Missouri, and the Missouri river should be attached to, and

further believing that the extension of the State line in the direction

indicated, would have a happy effect, by presenting a natural boundary between the whites and Indians ; and willing, moreover, to give the

United States a renewed evidence of our attachment and friendship, do

hereby for ourselves, and on behalf of our respective tribes ( having full

TREATY WITH THE NEW YORK INDIANS ,
AS AMENDED BY THE SENATE AND ASSENTED TO BY THE SEVERAL TRIBES , 1838.
Treaty with the New York Indians, as amended by the Senate of the United States, June 11th, 1838.

ARTICLES OF A TREATY

Jan. 15 , 1838.
Proclamation, April 4, 1840.

Made and concluded at Buffalo Creek in the State of New York,
the fifteenth day of January in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and thirty-eight, by Ransom H. Gillet, a commissioner on the part of the United States, and the chiefs, head men and warriors of the several tribes of New York Indians assembled in council witnesseth :

Preamble. Ante, p. 342.

WHEREAS, The six nations of New York Indians not long after the close of the war of the Revolution, became convinced from the rapid increase of the white settlements around, that the time was not far distant when their true interest must lead them to seek a new home
among their red brethren in the West : And whereas this subject was agitated in a general council of the Six nations as early as 1810 , and resulted in sending a memorial to the President of the United States, inquiring whether the Government would consent to their leaving their habitations and their removing into the neighborhood of their western brethren, and if they could procure a home there, by gift or purchase, whether the Government would acknowledge their title to the lands so obtained in the same manner it had acknowledged it in those from whom they might receive it ; and further, whether the existing treaties would, in such a case remain in full force, and their annuities be paid as heretofore : And whereas, with the approbation of the President of the United States, purchases were made by the New York Indians from the Menomonie and Winnebago Indians of certain lands at Green Bay in the Territory of Wisconsin , which after much difficulty and contention with those Indians concerning the extent of that purchase, the whole subject was finally settled by a treaty between the United States and the Menomonie Indians, concluded in February, 1831 , to which the New York Indians gave their assent on the seventeenth day of October 1832 : And whereas, by the provisions of that treaty, five hundred thousand acres of land are secured to the New York Indians of the Six Na-
tions and the St. Regis tribe, as a future home, on condition that they all remove to the same, within three years , or such reasonable time as the President should prescribe : And whereas, the President is satisfied that various considerations have prevented those still residing in New York from removing to Green Bay, and among other reasons, that many who were in favour of emigration, preferred to remove at once to the Indian territory, which they were fully persuaded was the only permanent and peaceable home for all the Indians. And they therefore applied to the President to take their Green Bay lands, and provide them a new home among their brethren in the Indian territory. And
(550)

551

whereas, the President being anxious to promote the peace, prosperity and happiness of his red children, and being determined to carry out the humane policy of the Government in removing the Indians from the east to the west of the Mississippi, within the Indian territory, by bringing them to see and feel, by his justice and liberality, that it is their true policy and for their interest to do so without delay.
Therefore, taking into consideration the foregoing premises, the following articles of a treaty are entered into between the United States of America and the several tribes of the New York Indians, the names
of whose chiefs, head men and warriors are hereto subscribed, and those who may hereafter give their assent to this treaty in writing, within such time as the President shall appoint.
