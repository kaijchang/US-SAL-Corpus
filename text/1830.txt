Where the Supreme Court has affirmed the title to lands in Florida, and referred in its decree to a particular survey, it would not be proper in the court below to open the case for a rehearing, for the purpose of adopting another survey. Chaires v. The United States, 3 Howard, 611. The court below can only execute the mandate of the Supreme Court; it has no authority to disturb the decree, and can only settle what remains to be done. Ib.
The act of 26th May, 1830, ch. 106, providing for the final settlement of land claims in Florida, must be construed to contain the same limitation of time, within which claims were to be presented as that provided by the act of May 23, 1828, ch. 70. United States v. Marvin, 3 Howard, 620.
The limitation was one year. The courts of Florida, therefore, had no right to receive a petition for the confirmation of an incomplete concession, after the 26th May, 1831. Ib.
Under the Florida treaty, the United States did not succeed to those rights which the king of Spain had held by virtue of his royal prerogative, but possessed the territory, subject to the institutions and laws of its own government. Pollard's Lessee v. Hagan, 3 Howard, 212.

Chaires v. The United States, 3 Howard, 611. The court below can only execute the mandate of the Supreme Court; it has no authority to disturb the decree, and can only settle what remains to be done. Ib.
The act of 26th May, 1830, ch. 106, providing for the final settlement of land claims in Florida, must be construed to contain the same limitation of time, within which claims were to be presented as that provided by the act of May 23, 1828, ch. 70. United States v. Marvin, 3 Howard, 620.
The limitation was one year. The courts of Florida, therefore, had no right to receive a petition for the confirmation of an incomplete concession, after the 26th May, 1831. Ib.
Under the Florida treaty, the United States did not succeed to those rights which the king of Spain had held by virtue of his royal prerogative, but possessed the territory, subject to the institutions and laws of its own government. Pollard's Lessee v. Hagan, 3 Howard, 212.

rights of other persons to the same lands. Sec . 7. And be it further enacted, That so much of the act of twenty-
third of May, one thousand eight hundred and twenty-eight, as directed that the selection of claimants who availed themselves of the first section of said act by accepting a quantity equal to one league square within their respective grants, which confined the selection to sectional lines, shall not be held to extend to the selection by the claimants of a greater quantity than a section, but the said claimants who have, or may hereafter select, under the provisions of said law, any quantity equal to the amount granted in bodies larger than a section in the form of any Spa-
nish survey, or plat of survey, or where the sections are broken by any river, the said land so selected, or which may be so selected, is hereby confirmed to said claimants; and it shall be the duty of the surveyor
general to make a survey and certificate of all such claims, to return the same to the commissioner of the general land office, and thereupon a

vessels of the United States may import into the said colonial possessions, from the United States, any article or articles which could be imported in a British

vessel into the said possessions from the United States ; and that the vessels of the United States may export from the British colonies aforementioned, to any

country whatever other than the dominions or possessions of Great Britain, any article or articles that can be exported therefrom in a British vessel, to any

country other than the British dominions or possessions aforesaid, leaving the commercial intercourse of the United States with all other parts of the British

dominions or possessions on a footing not less favorable to the United States than it now is, That then, and in such case, the President of the United States

shall be authorized, at any time before the next session of Congress, to issue his proclamation, declaring that he has received such evidence, and that thereupon, and from the date of such proclamation, the ports of the United States

shall be opened indefinitely, or for a term fixed, as the case may be, to British vessels coming from the said British colonial possessions, and their cargoes, sub-

ject to no other or higher duty of tonnage or impost, or charge of any description whatever, than would be levied on the vessels of the United States or their

cargoes, arriving from the said British possessions; and that it shall be lawful for the said British vessels to import into the United States, and to export there-

from, any article or articles which may be imported or exported in vessels of the United States; and that the act, entitled " An Act concerning navigation," passed

on the eighteenth day of April, one thousand eight hundred and eighteen, an act

supplementary thereto, passed the fifteenth day of May, one thousand eight hundred and twenty, and an act, " An Act to regulate the commercial inter-

course between the United States and certain British ports," passed on the first day of March, one thousand eight hundred and twenty-three, shall, in such case,

be suspended, or absolutely repealed, as the case may require. And whereas, by the said act, it is further provided, that, whenever the ports

of the United States shall have been opened under the authority thereby given, British vessels and their cargoes shall be admitted to an entry in the ports of the United States from the islands, provinces, or colonies of Great Britain,

on or near the North American continent, and north or east of the United

States. And whereas satisfactory evidence has been received by the President of
the United States, that, whenever he shall give effect to the provisions of the

act aforesaid, the government of Great Britain will open, for an indefinite period, the ports in its colonial possessions in the West Indies, on the continent of South America, the Bahama Islands, the Caicos, and the Bermuda or Somer

Islands, to the vessels of the United States and their cargoes, upon the terms

and according to the requisitions of the aforesaid act of Congress. Now, therefore, I, Andrew Jackson, President of the United States of Ame-

rica, do hereby declare and proclaim that such evidence has been received by

me; and that by the operation of the act of Congress, passed on the twentyninth day of May, one thousand eight hundred and thirty, the ports of the

United States are, from the date of this proclamation, open to British ves-

sels coming from the said British possessions, and their cargoes, upon the terms set forth in the said act; the act, entitled " An Act concerning navigation,"

passed on the eighteenth day of April, one thousand eight hundred and eighteen, the act supplementary thereto, passed the fifteenth day of May, one thousand

eight hundred and twenty, and the act, entitled " An Act to regulate the commercial intercourse between the United States and certain British ports,"

In pursuance of the authority contained in the act of May 24, 1828, ch. 1ll, ante, p. 308, the act of January 7, 1824, ch. 2, ante, p. 2, proclamationshave been issued by the President of the United States, as follow:

Discriminating duties suspended upon Austrian vessels.

Whereas, by an act of the Congress of the United States of the 24th of May,

one thousand eight hundred and twenty-eight, entitled " An Act in addition to

an act, entitled ` An act concerning discriminating duties of Tonnage and Im-

post,' and to equalize the duties on Prussian vessels and their cargoes," it is

provided that, upon satisfactory evidence being given to the President of the

United States, by the government of any foreign nation, that no discriminating

duties of tonnage or impost are imposed or levied in the ports of the said nation,

upon vessels wholly belonging to citizens of the United States, or upon the

produce, manufactures, or merchandise, imported in the same from the United

States, or from any foreign country, the President is thereby authorized to issue

his proclamation declaring that the foreign discriminating duties of tonnage

and impost within the United States are, and shall be, suspended and discon-

tinued, so far as respects the vessels of the said foreign nation, and the pro-

duce, manufactures or merchandise, imported into the United States in the

same from the said foreign nation, or from any other foreign country ; the said

suspension to take effect from the time of such notification being given to the

President of the United States, and to continue so long as the reciprocal exemp-

tion of vessels, belonging to citizens of the United States, and their cargoes, as

aforesaid, shall be continued, and no longer.

And whereas, satisfactory evidence has lately been received by me, from his

Imperial Majesty the Emperor of Austria, through an official communication

of the Baron de Lederer, his Consul General in the United States, under date

of the 29th of May, 1829, that no other or higher duties of tonnage and impost

are imposed or levied since the first day of January last in the ports of Aus-

tria, upon vessels wholly belonging to citizens of the United States, and upon

the produce, manufactures, or merchandise imported in the same from the

United States, and from any foreign country whatever, than are levied on Aus-

trian ships and their cargoes, in the same ports under like circumstances.

Now, therefore, I, Andrew Jackson, President of the United States of

America, do hereby declare and proclaim, that so much of the several acts im-

posing discriminating duties of tonnage and impost within the United States,

are, and shall be, suspended and discontinued, so far as respects the vessels of

Austria, and the produce, manufactures, and merchandise, imported into the

United States in the same, from the dominions of Austria, and from any other

foreign country whatever, the said suspension to take effect from the day above

mentioned, and to continue thenceforward, so long as the reciprocal exemp-

tion of the vessels of the United States, and the produce, manufactures, and

merchandise imported into the dominions of Austria, in the same as aforesaid,

shall be continued on the part of the government of His Imperial Majesty the

Emperor of Austria.

Given under my hand, at the City of Washington, this third day of June,

in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and twenty-nine, and the

fifty-third of the Independence of the United States.

And whereas, satisfactory evidence has lately been received by me, from His Royal Highness the Grand Duke of Oldenburg, through an official communication of F. A. Mench, his Consul in the United States, under date of the 15th September, 1830, that no discriminating duties of tonnage or impost are imposed or levied in the ports of the Grand Dukedom of Oldenburg, upon vessels wholly belonging to citizens of the United States, or upon the produce, manufactures, or merchandise, imported in the same from the United States, or from any other country.
Now, therefore, I, Andrew Jackson, President of the United States of America, do hereby declare and proclaim that, so much of the several acts imposing discriminating duties of tonnage and impost within the United States, are, and shall be, suspended and discontinued, so far as respects the vessels of the Grand Dukedom of Oldenburg, and the produce, manufactures, and merchandise, imported into the United States in the same, from the Grand Dukedom of Oldenburg, and from any other foreign country whatever; the said suspension to take effect from the day above mentioned, and to continue thenceforward so long as the reciprocal exemption of the vessels of the United States, and the produce, manufactures, and merchandise, imported into the Grand Dukedom of Oldenburg in the same as aforesaid, shall be continued on the part of the government of His Royal Highness the Grand Duke of Oldenburg.

three districts) under the guidance of some discreet and well qualified person or persons may proceed during this fall to the West upon an
examination of the country. For their time and expenses the U. States agree to allow the said

Motives to treaty.
Merchants of the parties put, as to duties, on the footing of the most favored nation.

The object of this firm instrument, and the motive of this writing well drawn up, is, that--
No treaty or diplomatic and official convention, having, heretofore, existed, between the Sublime Porte, of perpetual duration, and the United States of America; at this time, in consideration of the desire formerly expressed, and of repeated propositions which have lately been renewed by that power, and in consequence of the wish entertained by the Sublime Porte to testify to the United States of America, its sentiments of friendship,--We, the Undersigned, Commissioners, invested with the high office of Chief of the Chancery of State of the Sublime Porte, existing forever, having been permitted by His very Noble Imperial Majesty to negotiate and conclude a treaty, and having thereupon conferred with our friend, the honorable Charles Rhind, who has come to this Imperial Residence, furnished with full powers to negotiate, settle, and conclude, the articles of a treaty, separately and jointly with the other two Commissioners, Commodore Biddle and David Offley, now at Smyrna, have arranged, agreed upon and concluded, the following articles:

Merchants of the Sublime Porte, whether Musselmans or Rayahs, going and coming, in the countries, provinces, and ports, of the United States of America, or proceeding from one port to another, or from the ports of the United States to those of other countries, shall pay the same duties and other imposts that are paid by the most favored nations; and they shall not be vexed by the exaction of higher duties; and in travelling by sea and by land, all the privileges and distinctions observed towards the subjects of other Powers, shall serve as a rule, and shall be observed towards the merchants and subjects of the Sublime Porte. In like manner, American merchants who shall come to the well defended countries and ports of the Sublime Porte, shall pay the same duties and other imposts, that are paid by merchants of the most favored friendly Powers, and they shall not, in any way, be vexed or molested. On both sides, travelling passports shall be granted.

Consuls.

Ar tic le II. The Sublime Porte may establish Shahibenders (Consuls) in the United States of America; and the United States may appoint their citizens to be Consuls or Vice Consuls, at the commercial places in the dominions of the Sublime Porte, where it shall be found needful to superintend the affairs of commerce. These Consuls or Vice Consuls shall be furnished with Berats or Firmans; they shall enjoy suitable distinction, and shall have necessary aid and protection.

Employment of brokers. Visit of American vessels.

Arti cle III. American merchants established in the well defended States of the Sublime Porte, for purposes of commerce, shall have liberty to employ Semsars (brokers) of any nation or religion, in like manner as merchants of other friendly Powers; and they shall not be disturbed in their affairs, nor shall they be treated, in any way, contrary to established usages. American vessels arriving at, or departing from, the ports of the Ottoman Empire, shall not be subjected to greater visit, by the officers of the custom-house and the Chancery of the Port, than vessels of the most favored nations.
