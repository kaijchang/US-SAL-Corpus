ADVERTISEMENT.

IN publishing the following Laws, the same plan has been adopted that was prescribed in the Joint Resolution of Congress of March 3, 1845 (Vol . V., p. 798) , authorizing a subscription to the edition of all the Laws of the United States published by us. A close examination of this
volume will disclose some apparent errors in the Laws as here printed ; but as we procure a careful collation with the records at Washington by an experienced reader of the Department of State, and scrupulously follow the original, any seeming errors must be attributed to the Rolls, and not to us. Where anything absolutely necessary to the sense is omitted in the Rolls, it is inserted in the text, enclosed in brackets.
We intend to publish annually, and as soon after the close of each Session of Congress as is possible, the Acts of that Session , in a similar form and with a similar arrangement.
It will be seen by the following extracts from the Act of Congress, August 8, 1846 (Vol. IX., p. 76) , and the Joint Resolutions of September 26 , 1850 ( Vol. IX., p. 564 ) , and March 31 , 1866 ( Vol. XIV. , p. 352) , that our edition has been sanctioned by Congress, and is the OFFICIAL EDITION.
" And whereas said edition of the said Laws and Treaties of the United States has been carefully collated and compared with the original rolls in the archives of the Government, under the inspection and supervision of the Attorney- General of the United States, as duly certified by that officer : therefore, Be it further enacted, that said edition of the Laws and Treaties of the United States, published by Little & Brown, is hereby declared to be competent evidence of the several public and private acts of Congress, and of the several treaties therein contained, in all the courts of law and equity and maritime jurisdiction, and in all the tribunals and public offices of the United States and of the several States, without any further proof or authentication thereof." -- APPROVED, August 8, 1846.
" Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the Secretary of State be authorized and directed to contract with Little & Brown to furnish their annual Statutes at Large, printed in conformity with the plan adopted by Congress in eighteen hundred and forty-five, instead of the edition usually issued by his order, under the act of Congress of April twentieth , eighteen hundred and eighteen, and which conforms to an edition of the laws now out of use." - APPROVED, September 26 , 1850.

" Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in

Congress assembled, That the Secretary of State be, and he is hereby, authorized and directed

to renew the contract of October thirty-first, eighteen hun red and fifty, between the Depart-

ment of State and Little, Brown, and Company, of Boston, Massachusetts, for the annual

publication of the Statutes at Largeof the United States until otherwise ordered by Congress,

in conformity with the joint resolutions approved respectively March third, eighteen hundred

and forty-five, and September thirtieth [ twenty-sixth], eighteen hundred and fifty. " -- Ap-

PROVED, March 31 , 1866 .

WHEREAS the Secretary of War, in behalf of the United States and in

Russell, and Thomas Ewing, junior, and their assigns, a lease of twenty acres of land in the military reserve at Fort Leavenworth, State of Kansas, for the term of sixteen years thereafter, with a preference to them of an extension of the term, and with the exclusive right to mine for coal under the lands of said.

military reserve ; and whereas the said lessees and their assigns accepted the said lease, and upon the faith thereof have prosecuted their mining operations under many difficulties at great expense, and have finally succeeded in striking the deep coal beds of that geological region after having expended their entire capital to the amount of forty thousand dollars ; and whereas it is now discovered that the said lease is invalid because

the Secretary of War was unauthorized in law to make the same, by reason of which the said lessees are deprived of their right to proceed, and are threatened with the total loss of their money, and are without redress ; and whereas in view of the incalculable benefit to be derived, not

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the Leavenworth Coal Company, being the successors and assigns of Samuel Denman, William H. Russell, and Thomas Ewing, junior, in the lease aforesaid, shall have the right to purchase from the United States twenty acres of land lying in the military reserve at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and described as fol-

ANDREW JOHNSON,

PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,

TO ALL AND SINGULAR TO WHOM THESE PRESENTS SHALL COME, GREETING : Feb. 19, 1867.

Whereas a Treaty was made and concluded at the city of Washington, in the District of Columbia, on the nineteenth day of February in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-seven, by and between Lewis V. Bogy and William H. Watson, Commissioners, on the part of the United States, and Gabriel Renville, Wamdiupiduta, Tacandupahotanka, and other Chiefs and Headmen of the Sissiton and Warpeton bands of Dakota or Sioux Indians, on the part of said Indians, and duly authorized thereto by them, which Treaty is in the words and figures following, to wit:

Preamble.

Whereas it is understood that a portion of the Sissiton and Warpeton bands of Santee Sioux Indians, numbering from twelve hundred to fifteen hundred persons, not only preserved their obligations to the government of the United States, during and since the outbreak of the Medewakantons and other bands of Sioux in 1862, but freely perilled their lives during that outbreak to rescue the residents on the Sioux reservation, and to obtain possession of white women and children made captives by the hostile bands ; and that another portion of said Sissiton and Warpeton bands, numbering from one thousand to twelve hundred persons, who did not participate in the massacre of the whites in 1862, fearing the indiscriminate vengeance of the whites, fled to the great prairies of the northwest, where they still remain ; and
Whereas Congress, in confiscating the Sioux annuities and reservations, made no provision for the support of these, the friendly portion of the Sissiton and Warpeton bands, and it is believed [ that ] they have been suffered to remain homeless wanderers, frequently subject to intense suffering from want of subsistence and clothing to protect them from the rigors of a high northern latitude, although at all times prompt in rendering service when called upon to repel hostile raids and to punish depredations committed by hostile Indians upon the persons and property of the whites ; and
Whereas the several subdivisions of the friendly Sissitons and Warpeton bands ask, through their representatives, that their adherence to their former obligations of friendship to the government and people of the United States be recognized, and that provision be made to enable them to return to an agricultural life and be relieved from a dependence upon the chase for a precarious subsistence : therefore,
A treaty has been made and entered into, at Washington city, District Contracting of Columbia, this nineteenth day of February, A. D. 1867 , by and be- parties. tween Lewis V. Bogy, Commissioner of Indian Affairs, and William H. Watson, commissioners, on the part of the United States, and the undersigned chiefs and headmen of the Sissiton and Warpeton bands of Dakota or Sioux Indians, as follows, to wit :

3,635.05
34,342.50

Total amount

$ 83,814.40

The above-named total sum is designed to represent the full claim of the Wyandottes against the United States under former treaties.
The 1st, 2d, and 4th items, together with another named in the 14th article of the
foregoing treaty, were examined and approved by the House Committee on Indian Affairs, and their payment recommended . - (See Congressional Globe, page 1037, part 2d, 2d session of 38th Congress.)
The 3d and 5th items constitute the interest on the moneys discounted on the bonds
mentioned in items 2 and 4. Although the committee did not recommend the payment of this interest, they acknowledged its justice, but said that its allowance would
possibly endanger the passage of the appropriation, as the general feeling was averse to paying interest on claims.
The 7th item embraces several small amounts for schools, blacksmith, &c. , which
were due and appropriated at the date of the treaty, but not paid, and were afterwards transferred to the surplus fund
The 8th item is for depredations on Wyandotte property during the Kansas troubles and the entire emigration to California. It was examined and approved by the Secretary of the Interior, March 21 , 1862.

A PROCLAMATION.

WHEREAS, by the Constitution of the United States, the executive power is vested in a President of the United States of America, who is bound by solemn oath faithfully to execute the office of President, and to the best of his ability to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States ; and is
by the same instrument made Commander- in-Chief of the army and navy of the United States, and is required to take care that the laws be faithfully
executed ; And whereas, by the same Constitution, it is provided that the said Constitu-
tion and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof shall be the supreme law of the land, and the judges in every State shall be bound thereby ;
And whereas in and by the same Constitution the judicial power of the United States is vested in one Supreme Court and in such inferior courts as

APPENDIX.

Congress may, from time to time, ordain and establish, and the aforesaid judicial power is declared to extend to all cases in law and equity arising under the Constitution, the laws of the United States, and the treaties which shall be made under their authority ;

And whereas all officers, civil and military, are bound by oath that they will support and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic, and will bear true faith and allegiance to the same ;

And whereas all officers of the army and navy of the United States, in accepting their commissions under the laws of Congress and the rules and articles of war, incur an obligation to observe, obey, and follow such directions as they shall from time to time receive from the President or the General,

or other superior officers set over them, according to the rules and discipline of war ;

And whereas it is provided by law that whenever, by reason of unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages of persons, or rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States, it shall became impracticable, in the judgment of the President of the United States, to enforce, by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings, the laws of the United States within any State or Territory, the Executive in that case is authorized and re-

quired to secure their faithful execution by the employment of the land and naval forces ;

And whereas impediments and obstructions, serious in their character, have recently been interposed in the States of North Carolina and South Carolina, hindering and preventing for a time a proper enforcement there of the laws of

the United States, and of the judgments and decrees of a lawful court thereof, in disregard of the command of the President of the United States ;

sixty-one, the two Houses of Congress, with extraordinary unanimity, solemnly declared that the war then existing was not waged on the part of the Government

in any spirit of oppression, nor for any purpose of conquest or subjugation, nor purpose of overthrowing or interfering with the rights or established institutions

of the States, but to defend and maintain the supremacy of the Constitution ,

and to preserve the Union with all the dignity, equality, and rights of the

several States unimpaired, and that as soon as these objects should be accom-
plished the war ought to cease ; And whereas the President of the United States, on the eighth day of Vol. xiii. pp.
December, anno Domini one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, and on the 737, 741.

twenty-sixth day of March, anno Domino one thousand eight hundred and sixty-

four, did, with the objects of suppressing the then existing rebellion, of inducing

all persons to return to their loyalty, and of restoring the authority ofthe United

States, issue proclamations offering amnesty and pardon to all persons who had

directly or indirectly participated in the then existing rebellion, except as in

those proclamations was specified and reserved ; And whereas the President of the United States did , on the twenty-ninth day Vol. xiii. p.

of May, anno Domini one thousand eight hundred and sixty-five, issue a further 758.

proclamation with the same objects before mentioned , and to the end that the

authority of the Government of the United States might be restored, and that peace, order, and freedom might be established , and the President did, by the said

last-mentioned proclamation, proclaim and declare that he thereby granted to

all persons who had directly or indirectly participated in the then existing

rebellion, except as therein excepted, amnesty and pardon, with restoration of

all rights of property, except as to slaves, and except in certain cases where

legal proceedings had been instituted, but upon condition that such persons

should take and subscribe an oath therein prescribed , which oath should be

registered for permanent preservation ;

And whereas, in and by the said last-mentioned proclamation of the twenty-

ninth day of May, anno Domini one thousand eight hundred and sixty-five , four-

teen extensive classes of persons, therein specially described , were altogether excepted and excluded from the benefits thereof ;
And whereas the President of the United States did, on the second day of

Vol. xiv. p.

April, anno Domini one thousand eight hundred and sixty-six, issue a proclama- 811. tion declaring that the insurrection was at an end, and was thenceforth to be so regarded ;

And whereas there now exists no organized armed resistance of misguided

citizens or others to the authority of the United States in the States of Geor

gia, South Carolina, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama, Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, Florida, and Texas, and the laws can be sustained and

enforced therein by the proper civil authority, State or Federal, and the people

of said States are well and loyally disposed, and have conformed, or, if per-

mitted to do so, will conform in their legislation to the condition of affairs growing out of the amendment to the Constitution of the United States prohibiting

slavery within the limits and jurisdiction of the United States ;

And whereas there no longer exists any reasonable ground to apprehend , within the States which were involved in the late rebellion, any renewal thereof, or any unlawful resistance by the people of said States to the Constitution

and laws of the United States ;

And whereas large standing armies, military occupation, martial law, military

tribunals, and the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus and

the right of trial by jury, are, in time of peace, dangerous to public liberty,

incompatible with the individual rights of the citizen, contrary to the genius

and spirit of our free institutions, and exhaustive of the national resources, and ought not, therefore, to be sanctioned or allowed, except in cases of actual necessity for repelling invasion or suppressing insurrection or rebellion ;

And whereas a retaliatory or vindictive policy, attended by unnecessary dis-

qualifications, pains, penalties , confiscations, and disfranchisements , now, as

always, could only tend to hinder reconciliation among the people and national

restoration, while it must seriously embarrass, obstruct, and repress popular

energies and national industry and enterprise ; And whereas, for these reasons, it is now deemed essential to the public wel-

fare, and to the more perfect restoration of constitutional law and order, that the said last-mentioned proclamation , so as aforesaid issued on the twenty-ninth day of May, anno Domini one thousand eight hundred and sixty-five, should be

Full pardon extended to all persons participating in the late rebellion, and restoration

modified, and that the full and beneficent pardon conceded thereby should be opened and further extended to a large number of the persons who, by its aforesaid exceptions, have been hitherto excluded from executive clemency :
Now, therefore, be it known that I, ANDREW JOHNSON, President of the United States, do hereby proclaim and declare that the full pardon described in the said proclamation of the twenty-ninth day of May, anno Domini one thousand eight hundred and sixty-five, shall henceforth be opened [offered] and extended to all persons who, directly or indirectly, participated in the late rebellion, with the restoration of all privileges, immunities, and rights of property, except as to property with regard to slaves, and except in cases of

legal proceedings under the laws of the United States ; but upon this condition, nevertheless that every such person who shall seek to avail himself of this

proclamation shall take and subscribe the following oath, and shall cause the same to be registered for permanent preservation, in the same manner and with the same effect as with the oath prescribed in the said proclamation of

the twenty-ninth day of May, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-five, namely:

Oath to be taken.

do solemnly swear, (or affirm,) in presence of Almighty

God, that I will henceforth faithfully support, protect, and defend the Consti-

I will, in like manner, abide by and faithfully support all laws and proclama-

tions which have been made during the late rebellion with reference to the

emancipation of slaves : So help me God."

Republic as a day of National Thanksgiving and praise to the Almighty Ruler of Nations, with whom are dominion and fear, who maketh peace in His high places.
Resting and refraining from secular labors on that day, let us reverently and devotedly give thanks to our Heavenly Father for the mercies and blessings with which He has crowned the now closing year. Especially let us remember that He has covered our land through all its extent, with greatly needed and very abundant harvests ; that he has caused industry to prosper, not only in our fields, but also in our workshops, in our mines, and in our forests. He has permitted us to multiply ships upon our lakes and rivers, and upon the high seas, and at the same time to extend our iron roads so far into the secluded places of the Continent as to guarantee speedy overland intercourse between the two oceans. He has inclined our hearts to turn away from the domestic contentions and commotions consequent upon a distracting and desolating civil war, and to walk more and more in the ancient ways of loyalty, conciliation, and brotherly love. He has blessed the peaceful efforts with which we have established new and important commercial treaties with foreign nations, while we have at the same time strengthened our national defences, and greatly enlarged our national borders.
While thus rendering the unanimous and heartfelt tribute of national praise and thanksgiving which is so justly due to Almighty God, let us not fail to im-

A PROCLAMATION.

Preamble. Vol. xiii. pp. 787, 741, 758. Ante, p. 699.
Full pardon

WHEREAS in the month of July, anno Domini 1861 , in accepting the condition of civil war, which was brought about by insurrection and rebellion in several of the States which constitute the United States, the two Houses of
Congress did solemnly declare that that war was not waged on the part of the Government in any spirit of oppression , nor for any purpose of conquest or subjugation, nor for any purpose of overthrowing or interfering with the rights or established institutions of the States, but only to defend and maintain the
supremacy of the Constitution of the United States, and to preserve the Union with all the dignity, equality, and rights of the several States unimpaired, and that so soon as those objects should be accomplished, the war on the part of the Government should cease ;
And whereas the President of the United States has heretofore, in the spirit of that declaration, and with the view of securing for it ultimate and complete effect, set forth several proclamations, offering amnesty and pardon to persons
who had been or were concerned in the aforenamed rebellion, which proclamations, however, were attended with prudential reservations and exceptions, then deemed necessary and proper, and which proclamations were respectively issued on the eighth day of December, one thousand eight hundred and sixtythree, on the twenty-sixth day of March, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-four, on the twenty- ninth day of May, one thousand eight hundred and
sixty-five, and on the seventh day of September, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-seven ;
And whereas the said lamentable civil war has long since altogether ceased, with an acknowledgment by all the States of the supremacy of the Federal Constitution and of the Government thereunder, and there no longer exists any reasonable ground to apprehend a renewal of the said civil war, or any foreign interference, or any unlawful resistance by any portion of the people of any of the States to the Constitution and laws of the United States ;
And whereas it is desirable to reduce the standing army, and to bring to a speedy termination military occupation , martial law, military tribunals, abridgment of the freedom of speech and of the press, and suspension of the privilege of habeas corpus, and of the right of trial by jury, -- such encroachments upon our free institutions in time of peace being dangerous to public liberty, incompatible with the individual rights of the citizen, contrary to the genius and spirit of our republican form of Government, and exhaustive of the national resources ;
And whereas it is believed that amnesty and pardon will tend to secure a complete and universal establishment and prevalence of municipal law and order, in conformity with the Constitution of the United States, and to remove all appearances or presumptions of a retaliatory or vindictive policy on the part of the Government, attended by unnecessary disqualifications, pains, penalties, confiscations, and disfranchisements, and, on the contrary, to promote and pro-
cure complete fraternal reconciliation among the whole people, with due submission to the Constitution and laws:
Now, therefore, be it known that I, ANDREW JOHNSON, President of the

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA : October 12, 1868.
A PROCLAMATION.
IN the year which is now drawing to its end, the art, the skill, and the labor Day for Pubof the people of the United States have been employed with greater diligence lic Thanksgiv and vigor, and on broader fields than ever before, and the fruits of the earth ing recommendhave been gathered into the granary and the storehouse in marvellous abun ed. dance. Our highways have been lengthened, and new and prolific regions have been occupied. We are permitted to hope that long protracted political and sectional dissensions are at no distant day to give place to returning harmony and fraternal affection throughout the Republic. Many foreign states have entered into liberal agreements with us, while nations which are far off, and which heretofore have been unsocial and exclusive, have become our friends.
The annual period of rest, which we have reached in health and tranquillity, and which is crowned with so many blessings, is by universal consent a convenient and suitable one for cultivating personal piety and practising public devotion.
I therefore recommend that Thursday, the twenty-sixth day of November next, Thursday, be set apart, and observed by all the people of the United states, as a day for November 26th, public praise, thanksgiving, and prayer to the Almighty Creator and Divine 1868. Ruler of the Universe, by whose ever-watchful, merciful, and gracious providence alone, states and nations, no less than families and individual men, do live and move and have their being.
In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.

No. 15. BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA : Dec. 25, 1868.

fourth day of July, in the present year;

And whereas, the authority of the Federal Government having been re-es-

tablished in all the States anu Territories within the jurisdiction of the United

States, it is believed that such prudential reservations and exceptions as at the dates of said several proclamations were deemed necessary and proper may now

be wisely and justly relinquished, and that a universal amnesty and pardon for

participation in said rebellion extended to all who have borne any part therein

will tend to secure permanent peace, order, and prosperity throughout the land,

and to renew and fully restore confidence and fraternal feeling among the whole

people, and their respect for and attachment to the National Government, de-

Full pardon and amnesty granted to all
persons engaged in the late rebellion.

United States, by virtue of the power and authority in me vested by the Constitution, and in the name of the sovereign people of the United States, do hereby proclaim and declare unconditionally, and without reservation, to all and to every person who directly or indirectly participated in the late insur-

rection or rebellion, a full pardon and amnesty for the offence of treason against

the United States, or of adhering to their enemies during the late civil war,

with restoration of all rights, privileges, and immunities under the Constitution and the laws which have been made in pursuance thereof.

In testimony whereof, I have signed these presents with my hand, and have caused the seal of the United States to be hereunto affixed.
