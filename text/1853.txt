The President of the United States of America, and his Majesty the Emperoi' of the French, being equally desirous to strengthen the bonds of friendship between the two nations, and to give a new and more ample development to their commercial intercourse, deem it expedient, for the accomplishment of that purpose, to conclude a special convention which shall determine, in a precise and reciprocal manner, the rights, privileges, and duties of the consuls of the two countries.

His Majesty the Emperor of the French:
The Count de Sartiges, Commander of the Imperial order of the Legion of Honor, &c., &c., his Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at Washington;
Who, after communicating to each other their full powers, found in good and due form, have agreed upon the following articles:

Sa Majestd L'Empereur des Frangais et le President des Etats Unis d'Amerique, egalement ddsireux de resserrer les liens d'amitie entre les deux nations et d'assurer aux relations de commerce etablies entre elles un nouveau et plus ample d^veloppement, ont jugd h propos pour atteindre ce but, de conclure une convention spdciale qui determinat d'une maniere precise et reciproque les droits privileges et devoirs des consuls des deux pays;
A cet effet ils ont nomme -- Sa Majestd L'Empereur des Frangais: M. Le Comte de Sartiges, commandeur de 1'ordre Imperial de la Legion d'honneur, &c., &c., son Envoye Extraordinaire et Ministre Plenipotentiaire a Washington; Le President des Etats Unis :

Right to hold In all the States of the Union, property in the whose existing laws permit it, so respective coun-long and to the same extent as the tries.
said laws shall remain in force,
Frenchmen shall enjoy the right of possessing personal and real pro-
perty by the same title and in the
same manner as the citizens of the United States. They shall be free to dispose of it as they may please,
either gratuitously or for value received, by donation, testament, or
otherwise, just as those citizens themselves; and in no case shall
they be subjected to taxes on transfer, inheritance, or any others dif-
ferent from those paid by the latter, or to taxes which shall not be equal-
ly imposed. As to the States of the Union, by
whose existing laws aliens are not permitted to hold real estate, the
President engages to recommend to them the passage of such laws as may be necessary for the purpose
of conferring this right. In like manner, but with the re-
servation of the ulterior right of es-
tablishing reciprocity in regard to possession and inheritance, the go-
venment of France accords to the citizens of the United States, the same rights within its territory in respect to real and personal proper-
ty, and to inheritance, as are en-
joyed there by its own citizens.

Dans tons les Etats de 1'Union
ou les lois actuelles le permettent, aussi longtems que les dites lois resteront en vigueur, et avec leur

titre et de la meme maniere que les citoyens des Etats Unis: ils pour-
ront en disposer librement et sans reserve, a titre gratuit ou onereux, par donation, testament ou autre-
ment, comme les habitants eux-
memes et ne seront, dans aucun cas, soumis a des droits de mutation, de
succession ou autres differents de
ceux payes par ces derniers, ou h des taxes qui ne leur seraient pas ^galement imposees.
Quant aux Etats de 1'Union, dont
la legislation actuelle ne permet pas aux etrangers de posseder des bien?
immeubles, le President s'engage a leur recommander de passer les lois
necessaires pour leur conferer ce droit.
De meme et en se r^servant tou-
tefois la faculte d'appliquer ulterieurement la reciprocity, en matiere de possession et de succession, le gou-
vernement Frangais reconnait aux
citoyens des Etats Unis le droit de jouir en France, en matiere de pro-

dont jouissent en France en pareille

part of the crews of ships-of-war, or merchant vessels of their nation,
who may be guilty or be accused of having deserted said ships and vessels, for the purpose of sending them on board, or back to their country.
To that end, the consuls of France
in the United States, shall apply to the magistrates designated in the
act of Congress, of May 4, 1826 -- that is to say, indiscriminately to any of the federal, State, or municipal authorities; and the consuls of the United States in France, shall apply to any of the competent au-
thorities and make a request in writing for the deserters, supporting
it by an exhibition of the registers
of the vessel and list of the crew, or by other official documents, to show that the men whom they claim belonged to said crew. Upon such
request alone, thus supported, and without the exaction of any oath from the consuls, the deserters, not
being citizens of the country where the demand is made, either at the time of their shipping or of their arrival in the port, shall be given up to them. All aid and protection

Sept. 12, 1853.' BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA :

A PROCLAMATION.

Wher eas a convention between the United States of America and the Kingdom of Bavaria was concluded and signed at London, by their
respective plenipotentiaries, on the twelfth day of September, one thousand eight hundred and fifty-three ; which convention, being in the English and
German languages, is word for word, as follows: --

Convention for the Mutual Extradition of Fugitives from Justice, in certain Cases, concluded between the Government of the United States, on the one part, and the Kingdom of Bavaria, on the other part.

 Preamble. Citizens not to
be surrendered.

The United States of America and his Majesty the King of Bavaria, actuated by an equal desire to further the administration of justice, and to prevent the commission of crimes in their respective countries, taking into consideration that the increased means of communication between Europe and America facilitate the escape of offenders, and that, consequently, provision ought to be made in order that the ends of justice shall not be defeated, have determined to conclude an arrangement destined to regulate the course to be observed in all cases with reference to the extradition of such individuals as, having committed any of the offences hereafter enumerated, in one country, shall have taken refuge within the territories of the other. The constitution and laws of Bavaria, however, not allowing the Bavarian government to surrender their own subjects for trial before a foreign court of justice, a strict reciprocity requires that the government of the United States shall be held equally free from any obligation to surrender
citizens of the United States.

For which purposes the high contracting powers have appointed as their plenipotentiaries: --

Die Vereinigten Staaten von Nord-Amerika und Seine Majestaet der Kbnig von Bayern, von dem gleichen Wunsche beseelt, in den beiderseitigen Staaten die Verwaltung der Rechtspflege und die Verhiitung von Verbrechen zu befbrdern,
in Erwagung, dass die verbesserten Verkehrs-Mittel zwischen Europa und Amerika das Entkommen von Verbrechern erleichtern und dass es daher einer gemeinschaftlichen Vorsorge bedarf, damit nicht die Zwecke
del' Gerechtigkeit vereitelt werden, dann in Berucksichtigung der Verfassung und Gesetzgebung Bayern's, welche es der Bayerischen Regierung nicht gestatten ihre eigene Unterthanen zur Aburtheilung vor frem-
den Gerichtshbfen auszuliefern, so wie in Berucksichtigung des Grund-
satzes genauer Reciprocitiit, nach welchem auch die Regierung der Vereinigten Staaten eine Verbindlichkeit zur Auslieferung von Biirgern der Vereinigten Staaten gegeniiber der Bayerischen Regierung nicht eingehen soli, haben Sich
entschlossen eine Uebereinkunft abzuschliessen, welche in alien Fallen zur Richtschnur des Verfahrens hinsichtlich der Auslieferung soldier Personen dienen soil, welche in dem
einen Lande gewisse hiernach namentlich aufgezahlten Verbrechen veriibt und sich sodann in das Gebiet des andern Staates gefliichtet haben.

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. July 27, 1858.

A PROCLAMATION.

Whereas a Treaty, between the United States of America and the Argentine Confederation, was concluded and signed by their respective Plenipotentiaries, at San Jose, on the twenty-seventh day of July, eigh-
teen hundred and fifty-three ; which treaty being in the English and Spanish language, is, word for word, as follows : --

Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, Tratado de Amistad, Comercio y

and Navigation, between the Navegacion, entre la Confedera-

United States and the Argen- cion Argentina y los Estados

tine Confederation.

Unidos.

Commercial intercourse having been for some time established between the United States and the Argentine Confederation, it seems good for the security as well as the encouragement of such commercial intercourse, and for the maintenance of good understanding between the two governments, that the relations now subsisting between them should be regularly acknowledged and confirmed by the signing of a treaty of friendship, commerce, and navigation. For this purpose they have nominated their respective plenipotentiaries, that is to say : --
The President of the United States, Robert C. Schenck, envoy extraordinary, and minister plenipotentiary of the United States to Brazil, and John S. Pendleton, charge d'affaires of the United States to the Argentine Confederation ; and his excellency the provisional director of the Argentine Confederation, Doctor Don Salvador Maria del Carril, and Doctor Don Josd Benjamin Gorostiaga;
Who, after having communicated to each other their full powers, found in good and due form, have agreed upon the following articles:

Hallandose establecidas hace tiempo relaciones comerciales entre la Confederacion Argentina y los Estados Unidos, ha parecido conveniente, asi para la seguridad y fomento de aquella correspond encia comercial, como para mantener la buena inteligencia entre ambos gobiernos, que las relaciones que ahora existen entre ellos, sean regularmente conocidas y confirmadas por un tratado de amistad, comercio y navegacion. - Con este objeto han nombrado sus respectivos plenipotentiaries a saber: --
El Exmo. Senor, director provisorio de la Confederacion Argentina, al Doctor Don Salvador Maria del Carril, y al Doctor Don Jose Benjamin Gorostiaga, y el Presidente de los Estados Unidos, d Roberto C. Schenck, enviado extraordinario y ministro plenipotenciario de los Estados Unidos a la corte del Brasil, y d Juan S.

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Dee. 30,1853.

A PROCLAMATION.

Wher eas a treaty between the United States of America and the Mexican Republic was concluded and signed at the City of Mexico on the thirtieth day of December, one thousand eight hundred and fiftythree ; which treaty, as amended by the Senate of the United States, and being in the English and Spanish languages, is word for word as follows:

Preamble.

In th e name of Almi ght y God :
The Republic of Mexico and the United States of America, desiring to remove every cause of disagreement which might interfere in any manner with the better friendship and intercourse between the two countries, and especially in respect to the true limits which should be established, when, notwithstanding what was covenanted in the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in the year 1848, opposite interpretations have been urged, which might give occasion to questions of serious moment: to avoid these, and to strengthen and more firmly maintain the peace which happily prevails between the two republics, the President of the United States has, for this purpose, appointed James Gadsden, Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of the same, near the Mexican government, and the President of Mexico has appointed as Plenipotentiary " ad hoc " his excellency Don Manuel Diez de Bonilla, cavalier grand cross of the national and distinguished order of Guadalupe, and Secretary of State, and of the office of Foreign Relations, and Don Jose Salazar Ylarregui and General Mariano Monterde as scientific commissioners, invested with full powers for this negotiation, who, having communicated their respective full powers, and finding them in due and proper form, have agreed upon the articles following:

En el no mbre de Dios Tod op o -
dero so . La Republica de Mexico y los Estados Unidos de America, deseando remover toda causa de desacuerdo que pudiera influir en algun modo en contra de la mejor amistad y correspondencia entre ambos paises, y especialmente por lo respective a los verdaderos limites que deben fijarse, cuando no obstante lo pactado en el tratado de Guadalupe Hidalgo en el ano de 1848, aun se han suscitado algunas interpretaciones encontradas que pudieran ser ocasion de cuestiones de grave trascendencia, para evitarlas, y afirmar y corroborar mas la paz que felizmente reina entre ambas Repiiblicas, el Presidente de Mexico ha nombrado a este fin con el carficter de plenipotenciario ad hoc al Exmo. Sr. D. Manuel Diez de Bonilla, caballero gran cruz de la nacional y distinguida orden de Guadalupe, y Sccretario de Estado y del Despacho de Relaciones Exteriores, y a los Senores D.

said parallel of 31 20' to the 111th

For the performance of this portion of the treaty, each of the two governments shall nominate one commissioner, to the end that, by

common consent the two thus nomi-

Paso del Norte, three months after

the exchange of the ratifications of

this treaty, may proceed to survey

and mark out upon the land the

the mixed commission, according to

the treaty of Guadalupe, keeping a

La Republica Mexicana conviene en senalar para lo succesivo como verdaderos limites con los Estados Unidos los siguientes : Subsistiendo la misma linea divisoria entre las dos Californias, tai cual esta ya definida y marcada conforme al artfculo quinto del tratado de Guadalupe Hidalgo, los limites entre las dos Repiiblicas seran los que siguen: comenzando en el golfo de Mexico 4 tres leguas de distancia de la cos-
ta, frente a la desembocadura del Rio Grande, como se estipuld en el articulo quinto del tratado de Guadalupe Hidalgo; de alii, segun se fija en dicho articulo, hasta la mitad de aquel rio al punto donde la paralela de 31 47' de latitud norte atraviesa el mismo rio ; de alli,cien millas en linea recta al oeste; de alii, al sur 4 la paralela de 31 20' de latitud norte; de alii, siguiendo la dicha paralela de 31 20', hasta el 111 del meridiano de longitud oeste de Greenwich; de alii, en linea recta 4 un punto en el rio Colorado, veinte millas inglesas abajo de la union de los rios Gila y Colorado; de alii, por la mitad del dicho rio Colorado, rio arriba, hasta donde encuentra la actual linea divisoria entre los Estados Unidos y Mexico. Para la ejecucion de esta parte del tratado, eada uno de los gobiernos nombrara un comisario, a fin de que por comun acuerdo los dos asi nombrados, que se reuniran en la ciudad del Paso del Norte tres meses despues del cange de las ratificaciones de este tratado, procedan a recorrer y demarcar sobre el
terreno la linea divisoria estipulada por este articulo, en lo que no estuviere ya reconocida y establecida por la comision mixta segun el tratado de Guadalupe, llevando al efecto diarios de sus procedimientos, y levantando los pianos convenientes. A este efecto, si lo juzgaren necesario las partes contratantes, podrfin anadir a su respective comisario alguno 6 algunos auxiliares,

a true line of division between the
two Republics; that line shall be alone established upon which the commissioners may fix, their con-
sent in this particular being consi-
dered decisive and an integral part of this treaty, without necessity of ulterior ratification or approval, and without room for interpretation of
any kind by either of the parties contracting.
The dividing line thus established
shall, in all time, be faithfully re-
spected by the two governments, without any variation therein, unless
of the express and free consent of the two, given in conformity to the
principles of the law of nations, and in accordance with the constitution of each country respectively.
In consequence, the stipulation in
the 5th article of the treaty of Guadalupe upon the boundary line
therein described is no longer of any force, wherein it may conflict with that here established, the said line being considered annulled and abolished wherever it may not coin-
cide with the present, and in the same manner remaining in full force
where in accordance with the same.

in article twenty-one of the treaty of Guadalupe for similar cases; which article, as well as the twentysecond, is here reaffirmed.

Si en lo future (que Dios no permita) se suscitare algun desacuerdo entre las dos naciones, que pudiera llevarlas a un rompimiento en sus relaciones y paz reciproca, se comprometen asi mismo a procurer por

And whereas such expeditions can only be regarded as adventures for plunder and robbery, and must meet the condemnation of the civilized world, whilst they are derogatory to the character of our country,--in violation of the laws of nations,--and expressly prohibited by our own. Our statutes declare " that if any person shall, within the territory or jurisdiction of the United States, begin or set on foot, or provide or prepare the means for, any military expedition or enterprise, to be carried on from thence against the territory or dominions of any foreign prince or state, or of any colony, district, or people, with whom the United States are at peace, every person, so offending, shall be deemed guilty of a high.misdemeanor, and shall be fined not exceeding three thousand dollars, and imprisoned not more than three years: "
Now, therefore, I have issued this my Proclamation, warning all persons who shall connect themselves with any such enterprise or expedition in violation of our laws and national obligations that they will thereby subject themselves to the heavy penalties denounced against such offences, and will forfeit their claim to the protection of this government, or any interference in their behalf, no matter to what extremities they may be reduced in consequence of their illegal conduct. And therefore I exhort all good citizens, as they regard our national reputation, as they respect their own laws and the laws of nations, as they value the blessings of peace and the welfare of their country, to discountenance, and, by all lawful means, prevent any such enterprise ; and I call upon every officer of this government, civil or military, to use all efforts in his power, to arrest for trial and punishment every such offender against the laws of the country.

Preamble respecting a for-
mer precedent and the establishing a new one.

The attention of the Pre sid en t having been called to the proceedings of Congress at the close of its session, on the 4th of March, 1851, from which it appears that the constitutional term of that body was held not to have expired until 12 o'clock at noon of that day; and a notice having been issued, agreeably to former usage., to convene the Senate at eleven o'clock, A. M., on the 4th of March next, it is apparent that such call is in conflict with the decision aforesaid :
Now, therefore, as well for the purpose of removing all doubtAs to the legality of such call, as of establishing a precedent of what is deemed a proper mode of convening the Senate, I, MILLARD FILLMORE, President of the United States, have considered it to be my duty to issue this my Proclamation, revoking said call, and hereby declaring that an extraordinary occasion requires the Senate of the United States to convene for the transaction of business at. the capitol, m the city of Washington, on Friday, the 4th day of March next, at twelve o'clock, at noon of that day, of which all who shall at that time be entitled to act as members of that body are hereby required to take notice.
