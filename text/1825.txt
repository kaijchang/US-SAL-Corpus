Sec . 10. And be it further enacted, That, if any master or commander of any ship or vessel, belonging, in whole, or in part, to any citizen or citizens of the United States, shall, during his being abroad, maliciously, and without justifiable cause, force any officer, or mariner of such ship
or vessel, on shore, or leave him behind, in any foreign port or place, or refuse to bring home again, all such of the officers and mariners of such ship or vessel, whom he carried out with him, as are in a condition to return, and willing to return, when he shall be ready to proceed in his homeward voyage, every master or commander, so offending, shall, on conviction thereof, be punished by fine, not exceeding five hundred dollars, or by imprisonment, not exceeding six months, according to the aggravation of the offence.(a)
Sec . 11. And be it further enacted, That, if any person or persons, shall, wilfully and maliciously, set on fire, or burn, or otherwise destroy or cause to be set on fire, or burnt, or otherwise destroyed, or aid, procure, abet, or assist in setting on fire, or burning or otherwise destroying, any ship or vessel of war of the United States, afloat on the high seas, or in any arm of the sea, or in any river, haven, creek, basin or bay within the admiralty jurisdiction of the United States, and out of the jurisdiction of

Of any master, &c.,of any ship or vessel belonging in whole or in part to a citizen or citizens of the United States, while abroad, who shall force any officer, &c., on shore to leave him behind in any foreign port or place.
Of any person wilfully,&c. setting on fire any ship or vessel of the United States afloat on the high seas, or any arm of the sea, within

feloniously stealing a quantity of merchandise, belonging to the ship Bristol, the ship being in distress and cast away on a shoal of the sea on the coast of New York. The indictment was founded on the 9th section of the act, entitled " An act more effectually to provide for the punishment of certain crimes against the United States, and forother purposes," approved March 3, 1825. The goods were taken above high-water mark, upon the beach, in the county of Queens, in the state of New York. Held, that the offence committed was within the jurisdiction of the circuit court. The United States v. Coombs, 12 Peters, 72.
In cases purely dependent on the locality of the act done, the admiralty jurisdiction is limited to the sea, and to the tide water, as far as the tide flows. Mixed cases may arise, and often do arise, where the act and services done are of a mixed nature, as when salvage services are performed, partly on tidewater and partly on shore, for the preservation of the property; in which case the admiralty jurisdiction has been constantly exercised, to the extent of decreeing salvage. Ibid.
The offence of larceny is not punishable under the act 1790, ch. 9, unless committed in a place under the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the United States; and to bring the case within the statute, there must be an averment of such sole and exclusive jurisdiction in the indictment. The United States v. Edmond Davis, 5 Mason's C. C. R. 356.
" Personal goods" in that statutedoesnotincludechosesinaction,thelatter not being the subject of larceny at common law. Ibid.
Where larceny is committed in a place not under the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the United States, it may be yet punishable under the third section of the act of 1825, ch. 66. Ibid.
Offences are punishable under that section according to the state laws, where they are committed under circumstances, or in places, in which, before that act, no court of the United States had authority to punish them. Ibid.
It seems, that a reservation in a cession of " concurrent jurisdiction" to serve state process, civil and criminal in the ceded place, does not exclude the exclusive legislation, or exclusive jurisdiction of the United States, over the ceded place. It merely operates as a condition of the grant. Ibid.
See United States v. Kessler, Baldwin's C. C. R. 15.
(a) The crimes act of 1825, ch. 66, sec. 10, enumerates three distinct offences: (1) maliciously and wilfully, and without justifiable cause, forcing an officer or mariner on shore, in a foreign port, or (2) maliciously, or without justifiable cause, leaving any officer or mariner behind in a foreign port, or (3) maliciously, or without justifiable cause, refusing to bring home again all the officers or mariners of the ship, in a condition to return and willing to return. It is not necessary to complete the first or second of the enumerated offences, that the officer or mariner should be in a condition to return or willing to return. These latter words apply only to the trial of the enumerated offences. The United States v. Netcher, 1 Story's C. C. R. 307.
Where a mariner applied for a discharge, which was refused by the master, and he thereupon used abusive language to the master, for which he was imprisoned by the master, so that he was unable to return, and the ship sailed without him, it was held, that the leaving him behind was an offence under the crimes act of 1825, ch. 66, sec. 10. Ibid.
Indictment for maliciously, and without justifiable cause, forcing a seaman on shore, in a foreign port, against the crimes act of 1825, ch. 66, sec. 10. "Maliciously," in the statute, means wilfully, against a knowledge of duty ; "justifiable cause" does not mean such a cause as the known policy of the American laws on the subject contemplates as a cause of moral necessity, for the safety of the ship and crew, or the due performance of the voyage. The United States v. Thaddeus Coffin, 1 Sumner's C. C. R. 394.
Under the 10th section of the act of 1825, ch. 66, the forcing a mariner on shore must be done, not only without justifiable cause, but also maliciously, to justify a conviction. If done under a mistaken sense of duty, it is not a case for conviction. The United States v. Spencer Ruggles, 5 Mason's C. C. R. 192.
"Maliciously," in the statute, means with a wilful disregard of right and duty, or doing the act, against a man's own conviction of duty. Ibid.
A master of a ship has authority to confine his seamen in a common jail in a foreign port, for offences and misconduct in extreme cases; and when the proper correction and punishment cannot be effected on ship-board. Ibid.

No officer of the government has a right, by colour of his office, to require from any subordinate officer, as a condition for his holding his office, that he should execute a bond with a condition different from that prescribed by law. That would be, not to execute, but to supersede the requisites of the law. It would be very different, when such bond was, by mistake or otherwise, voluntarily, substituted by the parties for the statute bond, without any coercion, or extortion by colour of office. Ibid.

Act of April 30, 1790, ch. 9, sec. 14.

(a) Forgeries under the laws of the United States must be tried in the district where the crime is committed. The United States v. Britton, 2 Mason's C. C. R. 464.,
In an indictment for forgery, it is in general necessary to set forth the tenor of the instrument, and it must be proved as set forth. Ibid.
(b) Passing a paper is putting it off on payment or exchange. Uttering it, is a declaration that it is good, with an intent to pass, or an offer to pass it. United States v. Mitchell et al., Baldwin's C. C. R. 366.
The party accused of passing or uttering counterfeit paper, must be present when the act is done, privy to it, or aiding, consenting, or procuring it to be done. If done by consent, all are equally guilty. Ibid.
Passing a counterfeit note in the name of a fictitious person, an assumed name, or on a bank which never
existed, is within the law. It is not necessary that the note, if genuine should be valid, if on its face it purports to be good. The want of validity must appear on its face. Ibid.
The possession of other counterfeit papers, by the defendant, or a confederate, at the time of passing counterfeit notes, is evidence of the scienter. Ibid.
The law presumes the intention of passing counterfeit paper, to be to defraud any person who may suffer a loss by receiving it as genuine. The United States v. Shellmire, Baldwin's C. C. R. 370.
Intoxication is no defence to a charge of passing counterfeit bank notes, if the defendant was possessed of his reason, and was capable of knowing whether the note so passed was good or bad. Ibid.

(a) Indictment in the circuit court of North Carolina, for the forgery of, and an attempt to pass a certain paper writing,in imitation of, and purporting to be a bill or note, issued by the president and directors of the Bank of the United States, founded On the 18th section of the act of 1816, incorporating the Bank of the United States. The note was signed with the name of John Huske, who had not been, at any time, President of the Bank of the United States, but who, at the time of the counterfeit, was the president of the office of discount and deposit at Fayetteville; and was countersigned with the name of John W. Sanford, who at no time was the cashier of the mother bank, but who at the time of the counterfeiting was cashier of the said office of discount and deposit. Held, that this was an offence within the provisions of the law. The United States v. Turner, 7 Peters, 132.
The policy of the act extends to such a case. The object is to guard the public from false and counterfeit paper ; purporting on its face to be issued by the bank. It could not be presumed that persons in general could be cognisant of the fact, who, at particular periods, were the president and cashier of the bank. They were officers liable to be removed at the pleasure of the directors, and the times of their appointment or removal, or even their names, could not ordinarily be within the knowledge of the body of the citizens. The public mischief would be equally great, whether the names were those of the genuine officers, or of fictitious or unauthorized persons, and ordinary diligence would not protect them against imposition.

Mason's C. C. R. 290. The state courts have jurisdiction of offences committed on arms of the sea, havens, basins or bays,
within the ebb and flow of the tide, when these places are within the body of the county ; and in such cases the circuit court of the United States has no jurisdiction. Ibid.
Where an arm of the sea or creeks, haven, basin or bay, is so narrow that a person standing on one shore can reasonably discern, and distinctly see by the naked eye, what is doing on the opposite shore, the waters are within the body of a county. Ibid.
In such waters, it seems, that the admiralty and common law courts have concurrent jurisdic-
tion. Ibid. The county of Suffolk, in which the city of Boston is included, extends to all waters between the
circumjacent islands, down to the Great Brewster and Point Allerton. Ibid.

United States v. John Hart, Peters' C. C. R. 390. Driving a carriage through a populous and crowded street in the city, at such a rate or in such a
manner as to endanger the inhabitants, is an indictable offence at common law, and amounts to a breach of the peace; a constable is authorized, without warrant, to prevent the peace being so broken. Ibid.
The act of Congress prohibiting the stoppage of the mail, is not to be so construed as to prevent the arrest of the driver of a carriage in which the mail is carried, when he is driving through a crowded city at such a rate as to endanger the lives of the inhabitants. Ibid.

(b) And if any person shall attempt to rob the mail of the United States, by assaulting the person having custody thereof, shooting at him, or his horse or mule, or threatening him with

(a) The 25th section of the post-office law of 1825, which prescribes a penalty for the detention of a letter, refers to a letter or packet detained before it reaches its destination. The United States v. Pearce, 2 M'Lean's C. C. R. 14.
(6) The defendant was indicted upon the 24th section of the act of Congress of March 3, 1825, entitled " An act to reduce into one, the several acts establishing and regulating the post-office department," for advising, procuring and assisting one Joseph Straughan, a mail carrier, to rob the mail; and was found guilty. Upon this finding, the judges of the circuit court of North Carolina were divided in opinion on the question, whether an indictment founded on the statute for advising, &c., a mail carrier to rob the mail, ought to set forth or aver that the said carrier did, in fact, commit the offence of robbing the mail ? By the Supreme Court--The answer to this, as an abstract proposition, must be in the affirmative. But if the question intended to be put, is, whether there must be a distinct substantive averment of that fact, it is not necessary. The indictment in this case sufficiently sets out that the offence had been committed by the mail carrier. United States v. Mills, 7 Peters, 138.
The offence charged in this indictment is a misdemeanor, where all are principals; and the doctrine applicable to the principal and accessary in cases of felony does not apply. The offence, however charged against the defendant, is secondary in its character; and there can be no doubt that it must sufficiently appear upon the indictment, that the offence alleged against the chief actor had been
committed. Ibid. Upon an indictment for robbing the mail, and putting the life of the person having the custody of it in
jeopardy, under the 19th section of the act of April 30th, 1810, ch. 262, a sword, &c. in the hand of the robber, by terror of which the robbery is effected, is a dangerous weapon within the act, putting the life in jeopardy; though it be not drawn or pointed at the carrier. So a pistol in his hands, by means of which the robbery is effected, is a dangerous weapon; and it is not necessary to prove that it was charged; it is presumed to be so until the contrary is proved. The United States v. Wood, 3 Wash. C. CR. 440.
It is not necessary to a conviction, under the 22d section, that the carrier of the mail should have taken the oath prescribed by the 2d section of the act of 1825, or that the whole mail be taken. The United States v. Wilson et al. 1 Baldwin's C. C. R. 102.
All persons present at the commission of a crime, consenting thereto, aiding, or assisting and abetting therein, or in doing any act which is a constituent of the offence, are principals. Ibid.
The word " rob," in the act of Congress of 1825, sec. 22, is used in the common law sense.
Ibid. 93. " Jeopardy," as used in the section, means a well-grounded apprehension of danger to life, in case of
refusal to yield to threats, or resistance. Ibid. A mail carrier is within the 18th section of the " Act regulating the post-office establishment," sub-
jecting to a penalty in certain cases, " persons employed in any of the departments of the general post-office." United States v. Belew, 2 Brock. 280.

And, if any person shall steal the mail, or shall steal or take from, or out of, any mail, or from, or out of, any post-office, any letter or packet: or, if any person shall take the mail, or any letter or packet therefrom, or from any post-office, whether with or without the consent of the person having custody thereof, and shall open, embezzle or destroy any such mail, letter, or packet, the same containing any article of value, or evidence of any debt, due, demand, right, or claim, or any release, receipt, acquittance or discharge, or any other article, paper, or thing, mentioned and described, in the twenty-first section of this act; or, if any person shall by fraud or deception, obtain from any person having custody thereof, any mail, letter, or packet, containing any article of value, or evidence thereof, or either of the writings referred to, or next above mentioned, such offender or offenders, on conviction thereof, shall be imprisoned not less than two, nor exceeding ten, years.(a) And if any person shall take any letter, or packet, not containing any article of value, or evidence thereof, out of a post-office, or shall open any letter, or packet which shall have been in a post-office, or in custody of a mail-carrier, before it shall have been delivered to the person to whom it is directed, with a design to obstruct the correspondence, to pry into another's business or secrets; or shall secrete, embezzle, or destroy, any such mail, letter, or packet, such offender, upon conviction, shall pay for every such offence, a sum not exceeding five hundred dollars, and be
imprisoned not exceeding twelve months. Sec . 23. And be it further enacted, That if any person shall rip, cut,
tear, burn, or otherwise injure, any valise, portmanteau, or other bag, used, or designed to be used, by any person acting under the authority of the Postmaster General, or any person in whom his powers are vested, in a conveyance of any mail, letter, packet, or newspaper, or pamphlet, or shall draw or break any staple, or loosen any part of any lock, chain, or strap, attached to, or belonging to any such valise, portmanteau or bag,
with an intent to rob, or steal any mail, letter, packet, newspaper or pamphlet, or to render either of the same insecure, every such offender, upon conviction, shall, for every such offence, pay a sum, not less than one hundred dollars, nor exceeding five hundred dollars, or be imprisoned not less than one year, nor exceeding three years, at the discretion of the
court before whom such conviction is had. Sec . 24. And be it further enacted, That every person who, from and
after the passage of this act, shall procure, and advise, or assist, in the doing or perpetration of any of the acts or crimes by this act forbidden, shall be subject to the same penalties and punishments as the persons are subject to, who shall actually do or perpetrate any of the said acts or
crimes, according to the provision of this act. Sec . 25. And be it further enacted, That every person who shall be
imprisoned by a judgment of court, under and by virtue of the twentyfirst, twenty-second, twenty-third, or twenty-fourth sections of this act, shall be kept at hard labour during the period of such imprisonment.
Sec . 26. And be it further enacted, That the postmasters shall, respectively, publish, at the expiration of every three months, or oftener, when the Postmaster General shall so direct, in one of the newspapers published at or nearest the place of his residence, for three successive weeks, a list of all the letters remaining in their respective offices, or, instead thereof, shall make out a number of such lists, and cause them

TREATY

Aug. 19, 1825. Proclamation, Feb. 6, 1826.

With the Sioux and Chippewa, Sacs and Fox, Menominie, loway, Sioux, Winnebago, and a portion of the Ottawa, Chippewa, and Potawattomie, Tribes.

The United States of America have seen with much regret, that wars have for many years been carried on between the Sioux and the Chippewas, and more recently between the confederated tribes of Sacs and Foxes, and the Sioux; and also between the loways and Sioux; which, if not terminated, may extend to the other tribes, and involve the Indians upon the Missouri, the Mississippi, and the Lakes, in general hostilities. In order, therefore, to promote peace among these tribes, and to establish boundaries among them and the other tribes who live in their vicinity, and thereby to remove all causes of future difficulty, the United States have invited the Chippewa, Sac, and Fox, Menominie, loway, Sioux, Winnebago, and a portion of the Ottowa, Chippewa, and Potawatomie Tribes of Indians living upon the Illinois, to assemble together, and in a spirit of mutual conciliation to accomplish these objects; and to aid therein, have appointed William Clark and Lewis Cass, Commissioners on their part, who have met the Chiefs, Warriors, and Representatives of the said tribes, and portion of tribes, at Prairie des Chiens, in the Territory of Michigan, and after full deliberation, the said tribes, and portions of tribes, have agreed with the United States, and with one another, upon the following articles:

Firm and perpetual peace.

ARTICLE 1.
There shall be a firm and perpetual peace between the Sioux and Chippewas; between the Sioux and the confederated tribes of Sacs and Foxes; and between the loways and the Sioux.

Line between the respective countries.

ARTICLE 2.
It is agreed between the confederated Tribes of the Sacs and Foxes, and the Sioux, that the Line between their respective countries shall be as follows: Commencing at the mouth of the Upper loway River, on the west bank of the Mississippi, and ascending the said loway river, to its left fork; thence up that fork to its source; thence crossing the fork of Red Cedar River, in a direct line to the second or upper fork of the Desmoines river; and thence in a direct line to the lower fork of the Calumet river; and down that river to its juncture with the Missouri river. But the Yancton band of the Sioux tribe, being principally interested in the establishment of the line from the Forks of the Desmoines to the Missouri, and not being sufficiently represented to render the definitive establishment of that line proper, it is expressly declared that the line from the forks of the Desmoines to the forks of the Calumet river, and down that river to the Missouri, is not to be considered as settled until the assent of the Yancton band shall be given thereto. And if the said band should refuse their assent, the arrange-

all the matters herein providedfor.

Preamble. Ante, p. 237.

Whe rea s a treaty was concluded at the Indian Springs, on the twelfth day of February last, between Commissioners on the part of the United States, and a portion of the Creek Nation, by which an extensive district of country was ceded to the United States.
And whereas a great majority of the Chiefs and Warriors of the said Nation have protested against the execution of the said Treaty,, and have represented that the same was signed on their part by persons having no sufficient authority to form treaties, or to make cessions, and that the stipulations in the said Treaty are, therefore, wholly void.
And whereas the United States are unwilling that difficulties should exist in the said Nation, which may eventually lead to an intestine war, and are still more unwilling that any cessions of land should be made to them, unless with the fair understanding and full assent of the Tribe making such cession, and for a just and adequate consideration, it being the policy of the United States, in all their intercourse with the Indians, to treat them justly and liberally, as becomes the relative situation of the parties.
Now, therefore, in order to remove the difficulties which have thus arisen, to satisfy the great body of the Creek Nation, and to reconcile the contending parties into which it is unhappily divided, the following articles have been agreed upon and concluded, between James Barbour, Secretary of War, specially authorised as aforesaid, and the said Chiefs and Head Men representing the Creek Nation of Indians:

Treaty of Indian Springs declared null and void.

ARTICLE 2.

TREATY

Aug. 19, 1825. Proclamation, Feb. 6, 1826.

With the Sioux and Chippewa, Sacs and Fox, Menominie, loway, Sioux, Winnebago, and a portion of the Ottawa, Chippewa, and Potawattomie, Tribes.

The United States of America have seen with much regret, that wars have for many years been carried on between the Sioux and the Chippewas, and more recently between the confederated tribes of Sacs and Foxes, and the Sioux; and also between the loways and Sioux; which, if not terminated, may extend to the other tribes, and involve the Indians upon the Missouri, the Mississippi, and the Lakes, in general hostilities. In order, therefore, to promote peace among these tribes, and to establish boundaries among them and the other tribes who live in their vicinity, and thereby to remove all causes of future difficulty, the United States have invited the Chippewa, Sac, and Fox, Menominie, loway, Sioux, Winnebago, and a portion of the Ottowa, Chippewa, and Potawatomie Tribes of Indians living upon the Illinois, to assemble together, and in a spirit of mutual conciliation to accomplish these objects; and to aid therein, have appointed William Clark and Lewis Cass, Commissioners on their part, who have met the Chiefs, Warriors, and Representatives of the said tribes, and portion of tribes, at Prairie des Chiens, in the Territory of Michigan, and after full deliberation, the said tribes, and portions of tribes, have agreed with the United States, and with one another, upon the following articles:

Firm and perpetual peace.

ARTICLE 1.
There shall be a firm and perpetual peace between the Sioux and Chippewas; between the Sioux and the confederated tribes of Sacs and Foxes; and between the loways and the Sioux.

Line between the respective countries.

ARTICLE 2.
It is agreed between the confederated Tribes of the Sacs and Foxes, and the Sioux, that the Line between their respective countries shall be as follows: Commencing at the mouth of the Upper loway River, on the west bank of the Mississippi, and ascending the said loway river, to its left fork; thence up that fork to its source; thence crossing the fork of Red Cedar River, in a direct line to the second or upper fork of the Desmoines river; and thence in a direct line to the lower fork of the Calumet river; and down that river to its juncture with the Missouri river. But the Yancton band of the Sioux tribe, being principally interested in the establishment of the line from the Forks of the Desmoines to the Missouri, and not being sufficiently represented to render the definitive establishment of that line proper, it is expressly declared that the line from the forks of the Desmoines to the forks of the Calumet river, and down that river to the Missouri, is not to be considered as settled until the assent of the Yancton band shall be given thereto. And if the said band should refuse their assent, the arrange-

273

ment of that portion of the boundary line shall be void, and the rights of the parties to the country bounded thereby, shall be the same as if no provision had been made for the extension of the line west of the forks of the Desmoines. And the Sacs and Foxes relinquish to the tribes interested therein, all their claim to land on the east side of the Mississippi river.
ARTICLE 3.
The loways accede to the arrangement between the Sacs and Foxes, and the Sioux; but it is agreed between the loways and the confederated tribes of the Sacs and Foxes, that the loways have a just claim to a portion of the country between the boundary line described in the next preceding article, and the Missouri and Mississippi; and that the said loways, and Sacs and Foxes, shall peaceably occupy the same, until some satisfactory arrangement can be made between them for a division of their respective claims to country.

Relinquishment of Sacs and Foxes. lowas accede to the arrangement.

ARTICLE 4.
The Ottoes not being represented at this Council, and the Commissioners for the United States being anxious that justice should be done to all parties, and having reason to believe that the Ottoes have a just claim to a portion of the country upon the Missouri, east and south of the boundary line dividing the Sacs and Foxes and the loways, from the Sioux, it is agreed between the parties interested therein, and the United States, that the claim of the Ottoes shall not be affected by any thing herein contained; but the same shall remain as valid as if this treaty had not been formed.
ARTICLE 5.
It is agreed between the Sioux and the Chippewas, that the line dividing their respective countries shall commence at the Chippewa River, half a day's march below the falls; and from thence it shall run to Red Cedar River, immediately below the Falls; from thence to the St. Croix River, which it strikes at a place called the standing cedar, about a day's paddle in a canoe, above the Lake at the mouth of that river; thence passing between two lakes called by the Chippewas "Green Lakes," and by the Sioux "the lakes they bury the Eagles in," and from thence to the standing cedar, that " the Sioux Split;" thence to Rum River, crossing it at the mouth of a small creek called choaking creek, a long day's march from the Mississippi; thence to a point of woods that projects into the prairie, half a day's march from the Mississippi ; thence in a straight line to the mouth of the first river which enters the Mississippi on its west side above the mouth of Sac river; thence ascending the said river (above the mouth of Sac river) to a small lake at its source; thence in a direct line to a lake at the head of Prairie river, which is supposed to enter the Crow Wing river on its South side; thence to Otter-tail lake Portage; thence to said Otter-tail lake, and down through the middle thereof, to its outlet; thence in a direct line, so as to strike Buffalo river, half way from its source to its mouth, and down the said river to Red River; thence descending Red river to the mouth of Outard or Goose creek: The eastern boundary of the Sioux commences opposite the mouth of loway river, on the Mississippi, runs back two or three miles to the bluffs, follows the bluffs crossing Bad axe river, to the mouth of Black river, and from Black river to half a day's march below the Falls of the Chippewa River.

Claim of the Ottoes not to be affected by this treaty. Agreement between the Sioux and Chippewas.

ARTICLE 6.
It is agreed between the Chippewas and Winnebagoes, so far as they are mutually interested therein, that the southern boundary line of the Chippewa country shall commence on the Chippewa ri 'er aforesaid,
35

Agreement between the Chippewas and the Winnebagoes.

274

TREATY WITH THE SIOUX, ETC. 1825.

half a day's march below the falls of that river, and run thence to the source of Clear Water river, a branch of the Chippewa; thence south to Black River; thence to a point where the woods project into the medows, and thence to the Plover Portage of the Ouisconsin.

Agreement between the Winnebagoes and the Sioux, &c.

ARTICLE 7.
It is agreed between the Winnebagoes and the Sioux, Sacs and Foxes, Chippewas and Ottawas, Chippewas and Potawatomies of the Illinois, that the Winnebago country shall be bounded as follows: south easterly by Rock River, from its source near the Winnebago lake, to the Winnebago village, about forty miles above its mouth; westerly by the east line of the tract, lying upon the Mississippi, herein secured to the Ottawa, Chippewa and Potawatomie Indians, of the Illinois; and also by the high bluff, described in the Sioux boundary, and running nortn to Black river: from this point the Winnebagoes claim up Black river, to a point due west from the source of the left fork of the Ouiconsin; thence to the source of the said fork, and down the same to the Ouisconsin ; thence down the Ouisconsin to the portage, and across the portage to Fox river; thence down Fox river to the Winnebago lake, and to the grand Kan Kanlin, including in their claim the whole of Winnebago lake; but, for the causes stated in the next article, this line from Black river must for the present be left indeterminate.

Agreement between the Menominies and the Sioux, &c.
Boundary of the Ottawas, Chippewas, and Pottawatimies.
Ante. p. 146.

ARTICLE 8.
The representatives of the Menominies not being sufficiently acquainted with their proper boundaries, to settle the same definitively, and some uncertainty existing in consequence of the cession made by that tribe upon Fox River and Green Bay, to the New York Indians, it is agreed between the said Menominie tribe, and the Sioux, Chippewas, Winnebagoes, Ottawa, Chippewa and Potawatomie Indians of the Illinois, that the claim of the Menominies to any portion of the land within the boundaries allotted to either of the said tribes, shall not be barred by any stipulation herein; but the same shall remain as valid as if this treaty had not been concluded. It is, however, understood that the general claim of the Menominies is bounded on the north by the Chippewa country, on the east by Green Bay and lake Michigan extending as far south as Millawaukee river, and on the West they claim to Black River.
ARTICLE 9.
The country secured to the Ottawa, Chippewa, and Potawatomie tribes of the Illinois, is bounded as follows: Beginning at the Winnebago village, on Rock river, forty miles from its mouth, and running thence down the Rock river to a line which runs from Lake Michigan to the Mississippi, and with that line to the Mississippi, opposite to Rock Island; thence up that river to the United States reservation, at the mouth of the Ouisconsin; thence with the south and east lines of the said reservation to the Ouisconsin; thence, southerly, passing the heads of the small streams emptying into the Mississippi, to the Rock river at the Winnebago village. The Illinois Indians have also a just claim to a portion of the country bounded south by the Indian boundary line aforesaid, running from the southern extreme of lake Michigan, east by lake Michigan, north by the Menominie country, and north-west by Rock river. This claim is recognized in the treaty concluded with the said Illinois tribes at St. Louis, August 24, 1816, but as the Millewakee and Manetoowalk bands are not represented at this Council, it cannot be now definitively adjusted.
- ARTICLE 10.
All the tribes aforesaid acknowledge the general controlling power

TREATY WITH THE SIOUX, ETC. 1825.

275

of the United States, and disclaim all dependence upon, and connection with, any other power. And the United States agree to, and recognize, the preceding boundaries, subject to the limitations and restrictions before provided. It being, however, well understood that the reservations at Fever River, at the Ouisconsin, and St. Peters, and the ancient settlements at Prairie des Chiens and Green Bay, and the land property thereto belonging, and the reservations made upon the Mississippi, for the use of the half breeds, in the treaty concluded with the Sacs and Foxes, August 24, 1824, are not claimed by either of the said tribes.
ARTICLE 11.
The United States agree, whenever the President may think it necessary and proper, to convene such of the tribes, either separately or together, as are interested in the lines left unsettled herein, and to recommend to them an amicable and final adjustment of their respective claims, so that the work, now happily begun, may be consummated. It is agreed, however, that a Council shall be held with the Yancton band of the Sioux, during the year 1826, to explain to them the stipulations of this treaty, and to procure their assent thereto, should they be disposed to give it, and also with the Ottoes, to settle and adjust their title to any of the country claimed by the Sacs, Foxes, and loways.

Said tribes acknowledge the supremacy of the U. S.
Ante, p. 229. A council to be held in 1826.

ARTICLE 12.
The Chippewa tribe being dispersed over a great extent of country, and the Chiefs of that tribe having requested, that such portion of them as may be thought proper, by the Government of the United States, may be assembled in 1826, upon some part of Lake Superior, that the objects and advantages of this treaty may be fully explained to them, so that the stipulations thereof may be observed by the warriors. The Commissioners of the United States assent thereto, and it is therefore agreed that a council shall accordingly be held for these purposes.

An assembly of the Chippewas to be convened.

ARTICLE 13.
It is understood by all the tribes, parties hereto, that no tribe shall hunt within the acknowledged limits of any other without their assent, but it being the sole object of this arrangement to perpetuate a peace among them, and amicable relations being now restored, the Chiefs of all the tribes have expressed a determination, cheerfully to allow a reciprocal right of hunting on the lands of one another, permission being first asked and obtained, as before provided for.
ARTICLE 14.
, Should any causes of difficulty hereafter unhappily arise between any of the tribes, parties hereunto, it is agreed that the other tribes shall interpose their good offices to remove such difficulties; and also that the government of the United States may take such measures as they may deem proper, to effect the same object.

No tribe to hunt within the acknowledged limits of any other, without their assent.
In case of difficulty between the tribes.

ARTICLE 15.
This treaty shall be obligatory on the tribes, parties hereto, from and after the date hereof, and on the United States, from and after its ratification by the government thereof.

When to take effect.

Done and signed and sealed at Prairie des Chiens, in the Territory of Michigan, this nineteenth day of August, one thousand eight hundred and twenty-five, and of fhe Independence of the United States the fiftieth. WILLIAM CLARK, LEWIS CASS.

ART. 13.

Se conviene tambien del mismo modo, en que la misma libertad se estienda a las personas que se encuentren a bordo de buques libres, con el fin de que aunque dichas personas sean enemigos de ambas partes b de alguna de ellas, no deban ser estraidos de los buques libres, a memos que sean oficiales b soldados en actual servicio de los enemigos: a condicion no obstante, i se conviene aqui en esto, que las estipulaciones contenidas en el presente articulo, declarando que el Pabellon cubre la propiedad, se entenderan applicables solamente a aquellas potencias que reconocen este principio; pero si alguna de las dos partes contratantes, estuviere en guerra con una tercera, i la otra permaneciese neutral, la bandera de la neutral cubrira la propiedad de los enemigos, cuyos Gobiernos reconozcan este principio i no de otros.

the neutral does not protect the enemy's property, in that case the goods and merchandize of the neutral, embarked in such enemy's ships, shall be free.

Liberty of navigation and commerce to extend to all kinds of merchandise except the following.

ARTICLE 16th.
This liberty of navigation and commerce shall extend to all kinds of merchandize, excepting those only which are distinguished by the name of contraband, and under this name of contraband, or prohibited goods, shall be comprehended--
1st. Cannons, mortars, howitzers, swivels, blunderbusses, muskets, fuzees, rifles, carbines, pistols, pikes, swords, sabres, lances, spears, halberds, and granades, bombs, powder, matches, balls, and all other things belonging to the use of these arms;

ARTICLE 17th. All other merchandize and things not comprehended in the articles of contraband explicitly enumerated and classified as above, shall be held and considered as free, and subjects of free and lawful commerce, so that they may be carried and transported in the freest manner by both the contracting parties, even to places belonging to an enemy, excepting only those places which are at that time besieged or blockaded: and, to avoid all doubt in this particular, it is declared that those places only are besieged or blockaded which are actually attacked by a belligerent force capable of preventing the entry of the neutral.

Articles of contraband to be subject to detention and confiscation.
Further agreement.

ARTICLE 18th. The articles of contraband, before enumerated and classified, which may be found in a vessel bound for an enemy's port, shall be subject to detention and confiscation, leaving free the rest of the cargo and the ship, that the owners may dispose of them as they see proper. No vessel of either of the two nations shall be detained on the high seas on account of having on board articles of contraband, whenever the master, captain, or supercargo, of said vessels will deliver up the articles of contraband to the captor, unless the quantity of such articles be so great and of so large a bulk that they cannot be received on board the capturing ship without great inconvenience; but, in this and in all other cases of just detention, the vessel detained shall be sent to the nearest convenient and safe port, for trial and judgment, according to law.
ARTICLE 19th. And whereas it frequently happens that vessels sail for a port or place belonging to an enemy, without knowing that the same is besieged, blockaded, or invested, it is agreed, that every vessel so circumstanced may be turned away from such port or place, but shall not be detained, nor shall any part of her cargo, if not contraband, be confiscated, unless, after warning of such blockade or investment, from the commanding officer of the blockading forces, she shall again attempt to enter; but she shall be permitted to go to any other port or place she shall think proper. Nor shall any vessel of either, that may have entered into such port before the same was actually besieged, blockaded,

danos de una i otra parte no podran alegar que la ignoraban. Por el contrario, si la bandera neutral, no protegiese las propiedades enemigas, entonces seran libres los efectos i mercaderias de la parte neutral, embarcados en buques enemigos.

ART0. 16.

Esta libertad de navegacion i comercio se estendera a todo genero de mercaderias, eceptuando aquellas solamente, que se distinguen con el norabre de contrabando, i bajo este nombre, de contrabando b efectos prohibidos se comprenderan:
1. Canones, morteros, obuces, pedreros, trabucos, mosquetes, fusiles, rifles, carabinas, pistolas, picas, espadas, sables, lanzas, chuzos, alabardas, i granadas, bombas, polvora, mechas, balas, con las demas cosas correspondientes al uso de estas armas.

del neutral.

ART. 18.

Los articulos de contrabando antes enumerados i clasificados, que se hallen en un buque destinado a puerto enemigo estaran sujetos a detencion i confiscacion; dejando libre el resto del cargamento i el buque, para que los duenos puedan disponer de ellos como lo crean conveniente. Ningun buque de cualquiera de las dos Naciones, sera detenido, por tener a bordo articulos de contrabando, siempre que el Maestre, Capitan b Sobrecargo de dicho buque quiera entregar los articulos de contrabando al apresador, a menos que la cantidad de estos articulos sea tan grande i de tanto volumen, que no puedan ser recibidos a bordo del buque apresador, sin grandes inconvenientes; pero en este, como en todos los otros casos de justa detencion, el buque detenido sera enviado al puerto mas inmediato, comodo, i seguro, para ser juzgado i

sentenciado conforme a.las leyes.

ART. 19. Y por cuanto frecuentemente sucede que los buques navegan para un puerto b lugar perteneciente a un enemigo, sin saber que aquel este sitiado, bloqueado b envestido, se conviene en que todo buque en estas circumstancias se pueda hacer volver de dicho puerto, b lugar; pero no sera detenido, ni confiscada, parte alguna de su cargamento, no siendo contrabando; a menos que despues de la intimacion de semejante bloqueo b ataque, por el comandante de las fuerzas bloqueadoras, intentase otra vez entrar; pero le sera permitido ir a cualquiera otro puerto b lugar que juzgue conveniente. Ni ningun buque de una de las partes, que haya entrado en semejante puerto, b lugar, antes que estuviese

Regulation of visits at sea.

ARTICLE 20th.
In order to prevent all kind of disorder in the visiting and examination of the ships and cargoes of both the contracting parties on the high seas, they have agreed, mutually, that whenever a vessel of war, public or private, shall meet with a neutral of the other contracting party, the first shall remain out of cannon shot, and may send its boat, with two or three men only, in order to execute the said examination of the papers concerning the ownership and cargo of the vessel, without causing the least extortion, violence, or ill treatment, for which the commanders of the said armed ships shall be responsible with their persons and property, for which purpose the commanders of said private armed vessels shall, before receiving their commissions, give sufficient security to answer for all the damages they may commit. And, it is expressly agreed, that the neutral party shall in no case be required to go on board the examining vessel, for the purpose of exhibiting her papers, or for any other purpose whatever.

Course to be pursued to avoid vexation in the examination of papers.

ARTICLE 21st. To avoid all kind of vexation and abuse in the examination of the papers relating to the ownership of the vessels belonging to the citizens of the two contracting parties, they have agreed, and do agree, that in case one of them should be engaged in war, the ships and vessels belonging to the citizens of the other must be furnished with sea-letters or passports, expressing the name, property, and bulk of the ship, as also the name and place of habitation of the master or commander of said vessel, in order that it may thereby appear that the ship really and truly belongs to the citizens of one of the parties; they have likewise agreed that, such ships, being laden, besides the said sea-letters or passports, shall also be provided with certificates, containing the several particulars of the cargo, and the place whence the ship sailed, so that it may be known whether any forbidden or contraband goods be on board the same; which certificates shall be made out by the officers of the place whence the ship sailed, in the accustomed form; without which requisites, said vessel may be detained to be adjudged by the competent tribunal, and may be declared legal prize, unless the said defects shall be satisfied or supplied by testimony entirely equivalent.

Further agreement.

ARTICLE 22d. It is further agreed, that the stipulations above expressed, relative to the visiting and examination of vessels, shall apply only to those which sail without convoy; and when said vessels shall be under convoy, the verbal declaration of the commander of the convoy, on his word of honour, that the vessels under his protection belong to the nation whose flag he carries--and when they are bound to an enemy's port, that they have no contraband goods on board, shall be sufficient.

Prize causes.

ARTICLE 23d. It is further agreed, that in all cases the established courts for prize causes, in the country to which the prizes may be conducted, shall alone take cognizance of them. And whenever such tribunal of either party shall pronounce judgment against any vessel or goods, or property claimed by the citizens of the other party, the sentence or decree shall mention the reasons or motives on which the same shall have been

ART. 20.
Para evitar todo genero de desorden en la visita, i examen de los buques i cargamentos de ambas partes contratantes en alta mar, han convenido mutuamente, que siempre que un buque de guerra, publico o particular se encontrase con un neutral de la otr^i parte contratante, el primero permanecera fuera de tiro de canon, i podra mandar su bote, con dos d tres hombres solamente, para ejecutar el dicho examen de los papeles concernientes a la propiedad i carga del buque, sin ocasionar la menor estorcion, violencia b mal tratamiento, por lo que los comandantes del dicho buque armado seran responsables, con sus personas i bienes; a cuyo efecto los comandantes de buques armados, por cuenta de particulares, estaran obligados antes de entregarseles sus comisiones b patentes, a dar fianza suficiente para responder de los perjuicios que causen. Y se ha convenido espresamente, que en ningun caso se exigira a la parte neutral, que vaya a bordo del buque examinador con el fin de exibir sus papeles, b para cualquiera otro objeto sea el que fuere.
ART. 21.
