"Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the state of Ohio, That whenever the consent of the Congress of the United States to this act shall be obtained, the governor of this state shall be, and he is hereby, authorized to take under his care, on behalf of this state, so much of the road commonly called the National Road, within the limits of this state, as shall then be finished, and also, such other sections or parts thereof as may thereafter be progressively finished within the limits aforesaid, whenever the same shall be completed; and he shall be, and is hereby authorized to cause gates and toll-houses to be erected on said road, at such finished parts thereof as he shall think proper, for the purpose of collecting tolls, as provided by the fourth section of this act: Provided, The number of gates aforesaid shall not exceed one on any space or distance of twenty miles.
" Sec . 2. That a superintendent shall be appointed by the governor, whose duty shall be to exercise all reasonable vigilance and diligence in the care of the road committed to his charge; to contract for, and direct the application of the labour, materials, and other things necessary for the preservation, repair, and improvement thereof; he shall pay for the same out of such sums as the governor shall furnish him for that purpose, subject to such responsibility and accountability as the said governor shall dictate; and shall conform to such instructions as the governor shall prescribe for his conduct, in all particulars relative to his said trust: he may be empowered to suspend the functions of any tollgatherer for alleged misconduct, till the pleasure of the governor shall be known, and to fill the vacancy thereby occasioned during such interval ; and it shall be his duty to give information of the facts in such case to the governor, without any unnecessary delay; the said superintendent shall hold his office during the pleasure of the governor, who shall allow him a reasonable compensation for his services.

(a) Under the acts of Congress, and of the state of Ohio, relating to the surrender and acceptance of the Cumberland road, a toll charged upon passengers travelling in mail carriages, without being charged, also, on passengers travelling in other carriages, is against the contract, and void. Neil, Moore & Co. v. The State of Ohio, 3 Howard, 720.
It rests altogether in the discretion of the Postmaster General, to determine at what hours the mail shall leave particular places, and arrive at others, and to determine whether it shall leave the same place only once a day, or more frequently. Ibid.
It is not, therefore, the mere frequency of the departure of the carriages, carrying the mail, that constitutes an abuse of the privilege of the United States, but the unnecessary division of the mail-bags among a number of carriages, to evade the payment of tolls. Ibid.

Cha p. CIII.--An Act making appropriationsfor building lighthouses, lightboats, beacons, and monuments, and placing buoys.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House ofRepresentatives of the United States ofAmerica, in Congress assembled, That the following appropriations be, and the same are hereby, made, and directed to be paid out of any money in the treasury not otherwise appropriated, to enable the Secretary of the Treasury to provide, by contract, for building lighthouses, lightboats, beacons, and monuments, and placing buoys, to wit:

One who was not a Quaker, who refused to be sworn as a witness, on the ground of conscientious scruples, arising from a declaration formerly made, was committed, by the circuit court of Massachusetts for a contempt of the court; the liberty to affirm being strictly confined to Quakers, by the law and practice of Massachusetts. The United States v. Coolidge, 2 Gallis. C. C. R. 364.
That a counsellor, practising in the highest court of the state of New York, in which he resides, had been struck off from the roll of counsellors of the district court of the United States for the northern district of New York, by the order of the judge of that court for a contempt, does not authorize the Supreme Court to refuse his admission as a counsellor of the Supreme Court. Ex parte Tillinghast, 4 Peters, 108.
The Supreme Court does not consider the circumstances upon which the order of the district judge was given within its cognisance; or, that it is authorized to punish for a contempt, which may have been committed in the district court of the northern district of New York. Ibid.
If, from any collateral evidence, it should appear that there is reason to believe the respondent has perjured himself, the circuit court will recognise him to answer at the next term of the court, to such matters as may be found against him. United States v. Dodge, 2 Gallis. C. C. R. 313.
Unfair practices towards a witness who is to give testimony in court, or oppression under colour of its process, although those practices and that oppression were acted out of the district in which the court is sitting, may be punished by attachment, provided the person who has thus demeaned himself comes within the jurisdiction of the court. But, it is also believed that this mode of punishment ought not to be adopted, unless the deviation from law could be clearly attached to the person against whom the motion was made ; and unless the deviation were intentional; or unless the course of judicial proceeding were or might be so affected by it as to to make a punishment in this mode obviously conducive to a fair administration of justice. 1 Burr's Trial, 355.
Any publication, pending a suit, reflecting upon the court, the jury, the parties, the officers of the court, the counsel, &c., in reference to the suit, or tending to influence the decision of the controversy, is a contempt of the court, and punishable by attachment. Hollingsworth v. Duane, Wallace's C. C. R. 77.
For contempts to inferior jurisdictions, not of record, nor having a general power to fine and imprison, unless committed in presence of the officer, and punished instanter, there is no other mode of punishment than by indictment. Ibid.
It is not a contempt to serve a party, while attending at the court as a party in the cause, or as a witness, with a summons. The privilege extends to exemption from arrest, but no further. Blight's Ex'rs v. Fisher et al., Peters' C. C. R. 41.
It is a contempt of court to serve process, either of summons or capias, in the actual or constructive presence of the court. Ibid.

"Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the state of Ohio, That whenever the consent of the Congress of the United States to this act shall be obtained, the governor of this state shall be, and he is hereby, authorized to take under his care, on behalf of this state, so much of the road commonly called the National Road, within the limits of this state, as shall then be finished, and also, such other sections or parts thereof as may thereafter be progressively finished within the limits aforesaid, whenever the same shall be completed; and he shall be, and is hereby authorized to cause gates and toll-houses to be erected on said road, at such finished parts thereof as he shall think proper, for the purpose of collecting tolls, as provided by the fourth section of this act: Provided, The number of gates aforesaid shall not exceed one on any space or distance of twenty miles.
" Sec . 2. That a superintendent shall be appointed by the governor, whose duty shall be to exercise all reasonable vigilance and diligence in the care of the road committed to his charge; to contract for, and direct the application of the labour, materials, and other things necessary for the preservation, repair, and improvement thereof; he shall pay for the same out of such sums as the governor shall furnish him for that purpose, subject to such responsibility and accountability as the said governor shall dictate; and shall conform to such instructions as the governor shall prescribe for his conduct, in all particulars relative to his said trust: he may be empowered to suspend the functions of any tollgatherer for alleged misconduct, till the pleasure of the governor shall be known, and to fill the vacancy thereby occasioned during such interval ; and it shall be his duty to give information of the facts in such case to the governor, without any unnecessary delay; the said superintendent shall hold his office during the pleasure of the governor, who shall allow him a reasonable compensation for his services.
" Sec . 3. That the governor be, and he is hereby, authorized to appoint

Toll-collectors.

(a) Under the acts of Congress, and of the state of Ohio, relating to the surrender and acceptance of the Cumberland road, a toll charged upon passengers travelling in mail carriages, without being charged, also, on passengers travelling in other carriages, is against the contract, and void. Neil, Moore & Co. v. The State of Ohio, 3 Howard, 720.
It rests altogether in the discretion of the Postmaster General, to determine at what hours the mail shall leave particular places, and arrive at others, and to determine whether it shall leave the same place only once a day, or more frequently. Ibid.
It is not, therefore, the mere frequency of the departure of the carriages, carrying the mail, that constitutes an abuse of the privilege of the United States, but the unnecessary division of the mail-bags among a number of carriages, to evade the payment of tolls. Ibid.

the necessary collectors of tolls, and to remove any of them at his pleasure; and also, to allow them, respectively, such stipulated compensation as he may deem reasonable, it shall be the duty of each and every tollcollector to demand and receive, at the gate or station assigned to him by the governor, the tolls prescribed and directed by the fourth section of this act; and to pay monthly into the treasury, according to the directions they may receive from the treasurer of the state, all the moneys so collected by said collectors, that shall remain, after deducting their compensation aforesaid; the said collectors shall be governed in all respects relative to their office, by such regulations as the governor shall ordain, in order to insure a due responsibility, and faithful discharge of their
duties. " Sec . 4. That, as soon as the said gates and toll-houses shall be erected,
it shall be the duty of the said toll-collectors, and they are hereby required, to demand and receive for passing the said gates the tolls and rates hereafter mentioned; and they may stop any person riding, leading, or driving any horses, cattle, sulky, chair, phaeton, cart, chaise, wagon, sleigh, sled, or other carriage of burden or pleasure, from passing through the said gates, until they shall respectively have paid for passing the same, that is to say: For every space of twenty miles in length on said road, the following sums of money, and so in proportion for every greater or lesser distance, to wit: For every score of sheep or hogs, ten cents; for every score of cattle, twenty cents; for every led or drove horse, three cents; for every mule or ass, led or driven, three cents; for every horse and rider, six and one fourth cents; for every sled or sleigh drawn by one horse or ox, twelve and one half cents; for every horse or ox in addition, six and one fourth cents; for every dearborn, sulky, chair, or chaise, with one horse, twelve and one half cents; for every horse in addition, six and one fourth cents; for every chariot, coach, coachee, stage, or phaeton, with two horses, eighteen and three fourth cents; for every horse in addition, six and one fourth cents; for every other carriage of pleasure, under whatever name it may go, the like sum, according to the number of wheels and horses drawing the same; for every cart or wagon whose wheels do not exceed the breadth of two and one half inches, twelve and one half cents; for each horse or ox drawing the same, six and one fourth cents; for every cart or wagon whose wheels shall exceed two and one half inches in breadth, and not exceeding four inches, six and one fourth cents; for every horse or ox drawing the same, three cents: and for every other cart or wagon whose wheels shall exceed four inches, and not exceeding five inches in breadth, four cents; for every horse or ox drawing the same two cents; . and all other wagons or carts whose wheels shall exceed six inches in breadth, shall pass the said gates free and clear of all tolls: Provided, That nothing in this act shall be construed so as to authorize any tolls to be received or collected from any person passing to or from public worship, or to or from any musters, or to or from his common business on his farm or wood land, or to or from a funeral, or to or from a mill, or to or from his common place of trading or marketing, within the county in which he resides, including their wagons, carriages, and horses or oxen drawing the same; Provided, also, That no toll shall be received or col-
lected for the passage of any stage or coach conveying the United States' mail, or horses bearing the same, or any wagon or carriage laden with the property of the United States, or any cavalry or other troops, arms or military stores belonging to the same, or to any of the states comprising this Union, or any person or persons on duty in the military service of the United States, or of the militia of any of the states.
" Sec . 5. That the moneys so collected shall constitute a fund, to be denominated the United States' road fund; and so much thereof as may be paid into the treasury agreeably to the provisions above recited, shall

" Sec . 6. That directors shall be set up at proper and convenient situations, to caution all conductors or drivers of carriages on the road aforesaid, that they shall at all times pass on the left of each other, under the penalty of five dollars for every offence; and there shall also be set up at some conspicuous place at each gate, a board, on which shall be legibly painted the rates of toll, as is provided for in this act.
"Sec . 7. That, if any of the toll-collectors shall unreasonably delayer hinder any passenger or traveller at any of the gates, or shall demand or receive more toll than is by this act established, he shall, for each and every such offence, forfeit and pay to the party aggrieved the sum of ten dollars.
" Sec . 8. That if any person shall purposely and maliciously deface, or otherwise injure any of the mile-stones, parapet walls, culverts, or bridges, or any of the masonry whatsoever, or any of the gates or toll-
houses of and belonging to the said national road in this state, as the same is now constructed, or may hereafter be constructed, every person so offending shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined in a sum not
more than five hundred dollars, or be imprisoned in the dungeon of the jail of the county, and be fed on bread and water only, not exceeding twenty days, or both, at the discretion of the court.
" Sec . 9. That, if any person shall purposely fill, choke, or otherwise obstruct any of the side drains, valleys, gutters, or culverts of said road, now made, or hereafter to be made, or shall connect any private road or cartway with the said national road, without making at the point of connection a stone culvert, or paved valley, or other good and sufficient fixture, so as to secure a free passage for the water along such side drain, where such private road or cartway connects with the said national road, or if any person shall purposely and wilfully travel upon such parts of said national road as are or may be in an unfinished state, against the consent of the superintendent appointed by the United States, or by this state, or shall remove any of the beacons placed upon the said road so in an unfinished state as aforesaid, for the diverting of the travel on and from said road, every person so offending shall, upon conviction thereof, be, for every such offence, fined in a sum not less than one nor more than ten dollars.

authorized and required at the connection with, or intersection of, any state, county or township road, which now is or hereafter may be established under the laws of this state within their respective districts, to build and keep in repair a good and sufficient stone culvert or paved valley, or other good and sufficient fixture, in such manner as to admit of a free passage for the water along the side drain or drains of said national road, at the connection or intersection aforesaid, and according to the grade thereof, as established by the United States' superintendent of said national road.
" Sec . 13. That, for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of this act, the governor is hereby authorized to draw on the state treasury for any sum of money not exceeding two thousand dollars, to be paid out of any money in the treasury not otherwise appropriated : Provided, said sum shall be refunded to the state treasury out of the proceeds of the road fund created by the provisions of this act, so soon as the same shall be collected.
" Sec . 14. That all fines, penalties and forfeitures incurred under the provisions of this act, shall be recovered by indictment in the court of common pleas of the county where the offence was committed, or by
action of debt, in the name of the state of Ohio, for the use of the road fund established by this act, which action of debt may be brought before any justice of the peace or other court having jurisdiction thereof in the county where the offence was committed, or such fine, penalty or forfeiture was incurred; and it shall be the duty of the superintendent, tollgatherers, and of any other person who will complain of the same, to prosecute all offences against the provisions of this act.
" Sec . 15. That it shall be lawful for the General Assembly, at any future session thereof, without the consent of Congress, to change, alter, or amend this act: Provided, That the same shall not be so changed, altered or amended, as to reduce or increase the rates of toll hereby established, below or above a sum necessary to defray the expenses incident to the preservation and repair of said road, to the erection of gates and toll-houses thereon, and for the payment of the fees or salaries of the superintendent, the collectors of tolls, and of such other agents as may be necessarily employed in the preservation and repair of the same, according to the true intent and meaning of this act.
" Sec . 16. That any person or persons shall have the privilege of paying at either of the said gates, at the rates specified in this act, the amount of toll for any distance which such person or persons may desire to travel on said road, and receive a certificate thereof from the collector of tolls at such gate, which certificate shall be a sufficient voucher to procure the passage of such person or persons through any other gate or gates named in said certificate: Provided, That printed forms of such certificates shall be furnished by the superintendent to be appointed under the provisions of this act to each collector of tolls, and shall be countersigned by such superintendent, and otherwise so devised as to prevent fraud or imposition; and no certificate shall be considered as valid under this section unless such certificate shall be authenticated as aforesaid.
" Sec . 17. That the act, entitled ` An act for the prevention of injuries to the national road in Ohio,' passed February eleventh, eighteen hundred and twenty-eight, be, and the same is hereby, repealed: Provided however, That all actions and prosecutions which may now be pending shall be prosecuted to final judgment and execution, and all offences committed before the taking effect of this act shall be prosecuted and punished in the same manner as if the above-mentioned act was not repealed."

Cha p. CIII.--An Act making appropriationsfor building lighthouses, lightboats, beacons, and monuments, and placing buoys.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House ofRepresentatives of the United States ofAmerica, in Congress assembled, That the following appropriations be, and the same are hereby, made, and directed to be paid out of any money in the treasury not otherwise appropriated, to enable the Secretary of the Treasury to provide, by contract, for building lighthouses, lightboats, beacons, and monuments, and placing buoys, to wit:

One who was not a Quaker, who refused to be sworn as a witness, on the ground of conscientious scruples, arising from a declaration formerly made, was committed, by the circuit court of Massachusetts for a contempt of the court; the liberty to affirm being strictly confined to Quakers, by the law and practice of Massachusetts. The United States v. Coolidge, 2 Gallis. C. C. R. 364.
That a counsellor, practising in the highest court of the state of New York, in which he resides, had been struck off from the roll of counsellors of the district court of the United States for the northern district of New York, by the order of the judge of that court for a contempt, does not authorize the Supreme Court to refuse his admission as a counsellor of the Supreme Court. Ex parte Tillinghast, 4 Peters, 108.
The Supreme Court does not consider the circumstances upon which the order of the district judge was given within its cognisance; or, that it is authorized to punish for a contempt, which may have been committed in the district court of the northern district of New York. Ibid.
If, from any collateral evidence, it should appear that there is reason to believe the respondent has perjured himself, the circuit court will recognise him to answer at the next term of the court, to such matters as may be found against him. United States v. Dodge, 2 Gallis. C. C. R. 313.
Unfair practices towards a witness who is to give testimony in court, or oppression under colour of its process, although those practices and that oppression were acted out of the district in which the court is sitting, may be punished by attachment, provided the person who has thus demeaned himself comes within the jurisdiction of the court. But, it is also believed that this mode of punishment ought not to be adopted, unless the deviation from law could be clearly attached to the person against whom the motion was made ; and unless the deviation were intentional; or unless the course of judicial proceeding were or might be so affected by it as to to make a punishment in this mode obviously conducive to a fair administration of justice. 1 Burr's Trial, 355.
Any publication, pending a suit, reflecting upon the court, the jury, the parties, the officers of the court, the counsel, &c., in reference to the suit, or tending to influence the decision of the controversy, is a contempt of the court, and punishable by attachment. Hollingsworth v. Duane, Wallace's C. C. R. 77.
For contempts to inferior jurisdictions, not of record, nor having a general power to fine and imprison, unless committed in presence of the officer, and punished instanter, there is no other mode of punishment than by indictment. Ibid.
It is not a contempt to serve a party, while attending at the court as a party in the cause, or as a witness, with a summons. The privilege extends to exemption from arrest, but no further. Blight's Ex'rs v. Fisher et al., Peters' C. C. R. 41.
It is a contempt of court to serve process, either of summons or capias, in the actual or constructive presence of the court. Ibid.

ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT

Feb. 8, 1831. Proclamation, July 9, 1832.

Made and concluded at the City of Washington, this eighth day of February, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-one, between John H. Eaton, Secretary of liar, and Samuel C. Stambaugh, Indian Agent at Green Bay, specially authorized by the
President of the United States, and the undersigned chiefs and head men of the Menomonee nation of Indians, fully authorized and empowered by the said nation, to conclude and settle all matters provided for by this agreement.

Boundaries of Menomonee country.

The Menomonee Tribe of Indians, by their delegates in council, this day, define the boundaries of their country as follows, to wit;
On the east side of Green Bay, Fox river, and Winnebago lake; beginning at the south end of Winnebago lake; thence southeastwardly to the Milwauky or Manawauky river; thence down said river to its mouth at lake Michigan; thence north, along the shore of lake Michigan, to the mouth of Green Bay; thence up Green Bay, Fox river, and Winnebago lake, to the place of beginning. And on the west side of Fox river as follows : beginning at the mouth of Fox river, thence down
the east shore of Green bay, and across its mouth, so as to include all the islands of the " Grand Traverse;" thence westerly, on the highlands
between the lake Superior and Green bay, to the upper forks of the Menomonee river; thence to the Plover portage of the Wisconsin river; thence up the Wisconsin river, to the Soft Maple river; thence to the source of the Soft Maple river; thence west to the Plume river, which falls into the Chippeway river; thence down said Plume river to its mouth; thence down the Chippeway river thirty miles; thence easterly to the forks of the Manoy river, which falls into the Wisconsin river; thence down the said Manoy river to its mouth; thence down the Wisconsin river to the Wisconsin portage; thence across the said portage to the Fox river; thence down Fox river to its mouth at Green bay, or the place of beginning.
The country described within the above boundaries, the Menomonees
claim as the exclusive property of their tribe. Not yet having disposed of any of their lands, they receive no annuities, from the United States : whereas their brothers the Pootowottomees on the south, and the Winnebagoes on the west, have sold a great portion of their country, receive large annuities, and are now encroaching upon the lands of the Menomonees. For the purposes, therefore, of establishing the boundaries of their country, and of ceding certain portions of their lands to the
United States, in order to secure great and lasting benefits to themselves and posterity, as well as for the purpose of settling the long existing dispute between themselves and the several tribes of the New York Indians, who claim to have purchased a portion of their lands, the undersigned, chiefs and headmen of the Menomonee tribe, stipulate and agree with the United States, as follows:
First. The Menomonee tribe of Indians declare themselves the friends and allies of the United States, under whose parental care and protec-

tion they desire to continue; and although always protesting that they are under no obligation to recognise any claim of the New York In-
dians to any portion of their country ; that they neither sold, nor received any value, for the land claimed by these tribes; yet, at the solicitation of their Great Father, the President of the United States, and as an evi-
dence of their love and veneration for him, they agree that such part of the land described, being within the following boundaries, as he may direct, may be set apart as a home to the several tribes of the New York Indians, who may remove to, and settle upon the same, within three years from the date of this agreement, viz : beginning on the west side of Fox river, near the " Little Kackalin," at a point known as the " Old Mill Dam;" thence northwest forty miles; thence northeast to the Oconto creek, falling into Green bay; thence down said Oconto creek
to Green bay; thence up and along Green bay and Fox river to the place of beginning; excluding therefrom all private land claims confirmed, and also the following reservation for military purposes; beginning on the Fox river, at the mouth of the first creek above Fort Howard ; thence north sixty-four degrees west to Duck creek; thence down said Duck creek to its mouth ; thence up and along Green bay and Fox river to the place of beginning.

such manner as he may deem most advisable. Sixth. The Menomonee tribe of Indians shall be at liberty to hunt

The chiefs and Warriors of the Menomonee nation, acting under the authority and on behalf of their tribe, solemnly pledge themselves to preserve peace and harmony between their people and the Government of the United States forever. They neither acknowledge the power nor protection of any other State or people. A departure from this pledge by any portion of their tribe, shall be a forfeiture of the protection of the United States' Government, and their annuities will cease.

accept the provision made for their benefit, and to remove upon the lands set apart for them, on the west side of Fox river, that he will
direct their immediate removal from the Menomonee country; but if they agree to accept of the liberal offer made to them by the parties to this compact, then the Menomonee tribe as dutiful children of their great father the President, will take them by the hand as brothers, and
settle down with them in peace and friendship. The boundary, as stated and defined in this agreement, of the Me-
nomonee country, with the exception of the cessions herein before made to the United States, the Menomonees claim as their country; that part
of it adjoining the farming country, on the west side of Fox river, will remain to them as heretofore, for a hunting ground, until the President

Esta libertad de navegacion y comercio sera estensiva a todo genero de mercancias esceptuando solamente las que se distinguen con el nombre de contrabando; y bajo esta calificacion 6 la de efectos prohibidos se comprenderan, primero, canones, morteros, obuses, pedreros, trabucos, fusiles, escopetas, carabinas, comunes y rayadas, pistolas, picas, espadas, sables, lanzas, arpones, alabardas y granadas, bombas, polvora, mechas, balas y otras cosas que pertenecen a el uso de armas: segundo, escudos, yelmos, petos, cotas de maya, cinturones de infanteria, y uniformes 6 vestidos propios para la tropa; tercero, cinturones de caballeria y caballos con sus arneces; cuarto, y generalmente toda clase de armas e instrumentos en hierro, acero, bronce y cobre u otros materiales manufacturados, preparados y formados a proposito para hacer la guerra por mar 6 por tierra.

Arti cu lo XIX. Cualesquiera otras mercancias y cosas no comprendidas en los articulos en contrabando enumerados y clasificados esplicitamente como queda dicho, se tendran y consideraran libres, y de libre y legal comercio, de modo que podran llevarse y transportarse de la manera mas libre por ambas partes contratantes aun a parages pertenecientes a enemigos, esceptuando solo aquellos que a la sazon estubiesen sitiados 6 bloqueados; y para evitar toda duda en este particular, se declara que solo se consideraran bloqueados 6 sitiados aquellos puntos que se hallen sitiados 6 bloqueados por una fuerza beligerante capaz de impedir la entrada a los neutrales.
Arti cu lo XX. Los articulos de contrabando enumerados y clasificados arriba que se encuentren en un buque que navega para puerto enemigo, estaran sugetos a detencion y confiscacion, dejando libre el resto del cargamento y el buque para que los duenos dispongan lo que les paresca. Ningun buque de ambas naciones sera detenido en alta mar por conducir a bordo articulos de contrabando, siempre que el dueiio, capitan 6 sobrecargo del referido buque los entregue al apresador, a menos que la cantidad de estos articulos sea tan grande y abulte tanto que no pueda recibirlos el buque apresador sin grande inconveniente; pero en este y en todos los demas casos de justa detencion, el buque de tenido se enviara al puerto mas cercano conveniente y seguro para ser juzgado con arreglo a las leyes.

Nor shall any vessel of either of the contracting parties, that may have entered into such port before the same was actually besieged, blockaded, or invested by the other, be restrained from quitting such place with her cargo; nor if found therein after the surrender, shall such vessel or her cargo be liable to confiscation, but she shall be restored to the owner thereof.
Arti cle XXII. In order to prevent all kinds of disorder in the visiting and examination of the vessels and cargoes of both the contracting parties on the high seas, they have agreed, mutually, that, whenever a vessel of war, public or private, should meet with a neutral vessel of the other contracting party, the first shall remain out of cannon shot, and may send his boat, with two or three men only, in order to execute the said examination of the papers concerning the ownership and cargo of the vessel, without causing the least extortion, violence, or ill treatment, for which the commanders of the said armed vessels shall be responsible with their persons and property; and for this purpose the commanders of said private armed vessels shall, before receiving their commissions, give sufficient security to answer for all the damages they may commit. And it is expressly agreed, that the neutral party shall in no case, be required to go on board the examining vessel for the purpose of exhibiting his papers, or for any other purpose whatsoever.
Arti cle XXIII. To avoid all kinds of vexation and abuse in the examination of papers relating to the ownership of vessels belonging to the citizens of the two contracting parties, they have agreed, and do agree, that in case one of them should be engaged in war, the vessels belonging to the citizens of the other must be furnished with sea-letters or passports, expressing the name, property, and bulk of the vessel, and also the name and place of habitation of the master or commander of said vessel, in order that it may thereby appear that the said vessel really and truly belongs to the citizens of one of the contracting parties; they have likewise agreed that such vessels being laden, besides the said sealetters or passports, shall also be provided with certificates, containing the several particulars of the cargo, and the place whence the vessel sailed, so that it may be known whether any forbidden or contraband goods be on board the same; which certificate shall be made out by the officers of the place whence the vessel sailed, in the accustomed form: without which requisites, the said vessel maybe detained, to be adjudged by the competent tribunal, and may be declared legal prize, unless the said defect shall be satisfied or supplied by testimony entirely equivalent to the satisfaction of the competent tribunal.
Arti cle XXIV. It is further agreed, that the stipulations above expressed, relative to visiting and examination of vessels, shall apply only to those which sail without convoy; and when said vessels are under convoy, the verbal declaration of the commander of the convoy, or his word of honor that the vessels under his protection belong to the nation whose flag he carries, and when they are bound to an enemy's port, that they have no contraband goods on board, shall be sufficient.

Prize courts.

Arti cle XXV. It is further agreed, that in all cases the established courts for prize causes, in the country to which the prizes may be con-
ducted, shall alone take cognizance of them. And whenever such

Ni a buque alguno de las partes contratantes que hubiere entrado en tai puerto antes de ser bloqueado, sitiado d atacado por alguna de ellas, se le impedira salir del puerto con su cargamento, y si se hallare en el despues de la rendicion, ni el buque ni el cargamento seran confiscados sino debueltos a sus duenos.
Arti cu lo XXII. Para impedir toda clase de desorden en la visita y ecsamen de los buques y cargamentos de ambas partes contratantes en alta mar, ^nvienen mutuamente en que siempre que un buque de guerra nacional, 6 armado en corso se encontrare con un buque neutral de la otra parte contratante, el primero se mantendra. fuera del tiro de canon, y enviara su vote con solo dos 6 tres hombres para verificar el referido ecsamen de los papeles relatives al dueno y cargamento del buque, sin causar la menor violencia, vejacion 6 maltrato: para lo que los comandantes de los espresados buques armados, seran responsables con sus personas y propiedades, a cuyo fin los comandantes de dichos buques armados en corso por cuenta de particulares, daran antes de recibir sus patentes, fianzas suficientes para responder de los danos que puedan causar. Y se estipula espresamente que a buque neutral en ningun caso se le obligara ir a bordo del que registra a manifestar sus papeles, ni algun otro objeto sea el que fuere.
Arti cu lo XXIII. Para evitar toda vejacion y abuso en el ecsamen de los papeles relativamente a los duenos de los buques que pertenescan a ciudadanos de las dos partes contratantes, han convenido y convienen que en caso de hallarse una de ellas en guerra, los buques y navios que pertenescan a ciudadanos de la otra, deberan ser provistos con patentes de mar 6 pasaportes, que espresen el nombre, propiedad y dimensiones del buque, asi como el nombre del lugar en que habite el capitan 6 comandante del buque para que aparesca real y verdaderamente que pertenece a ciudadanos de una de las partes contratantes; y han convenido igualmente en que los referidos buques si condujesen cargamento ademas de las patentes de mar 6 pasaportes, seran provistos de certificaciones con espresion de cada uno de los articulos que comprende el cargamento y el lugar de su procedencia, para saber si a su bordo se hallan efectos de contrabando; cuya certificacion se dara por les autoridades del lugar de donde salio el buque en la forma acostumbrada: sin cuyo requisite el referido buque podra ser detenido para ser juzgado por tribunal competente, y podra ser declarado buena presa, a menos que esta falta se satisfaga 6 sup]a con testimonio equivalente a satisfaccion del tribunal competente.
Ar tic ulo XXIV. Convienen ademas en que las estipulaciones arriba espresadas relativamente al ecsamen y visitas de buques tendran lugar solamente respecto de aquellos que navegan sin convoy y que cuando los dichos buques estubieren bajo convoy sera bastante la declaracion verbal del comandante del convoy bajo su palabra de honor de que los buques que estan bajo su proteccion pertenecen a la nacion del pavellon que enarbola, y cuando van con destino a puerto enemigo, de que no llevan contrabando a bordo.
Arti cu lo XXV. Se convienen ademas que en todos los cases los tribunales establecidos para juzgar presas en el pais adonde estas sean conducidas tendran ellos solos el conocimiento de estas causas y cuando

The archives and papers of the consulates shall be respected inviolably, and under no pretext whatever shall any magistrate seize, or in any way interfere with them.
Arti cle XXX.

sonably delayed. Fourthly. Nothing in this treaty contained, shall however be con-
strued to operate contrary to former and existing public treaties with other Sovereigns or States.
The present treaty of amity, commerce, and navigation, shall be approved and ratified by the President of the United States of America, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate thereof, and by the Vice-President of the United Mexican States, with the consent and approbation of the Congress thereof; and the ratifications shall be exchanged in the city of Washington, within the term of one year, to be counted from the date of the signature hereof; or sooner, if possible.

Cuarto. Nada de lo contenido en este tratado podra de manera alguna interpretarse ni obrara en contra de los tratados publicos celebrados anteriormente y ecsistentes con otros Soberanos y Estados.

Whe re as it has been represented, that many uninformed or evil disposed persons have taken possession of, or made settlement on, the public lands of the United States, within the district of lands subject to sale, at Huntsville, in the State of Alabama, which have not been previously sold, ceded, or leased by the United States, or the claim to which lands, by such persons, has not been previously recognized and confirmed by the United States; which possession or settlement is, by the act of Congress, passed on the third day of March, one thousand eight hundred and seven, expressly prohibited: and whereas, the due execution of the said act of Congress, as well as the general interest, require that such illegal practices should be promptly repressed:
Now, therefore, I, ANDREW JACKSON, President of the United States, have thought proper to issue this my proclamation, commanding and strictly enjoining all persons who have unlawfully taken possession of, or made any settlement on, or who now unlawfully occupy any of the public lands within the district of lands subject to sale at Huntsville, in the State of Alabama, as aforesaid, forthwith to remove therefrom; and I do hereby further command and enjoin the marshal, or officer acting as marshal, in that State, where such possession shall have been taken, or settlement made, to remove, from and after the first of September, one thousand eight hundred and thirty, all or any of the said unlawful occupants; and to effect the said service, I do hereby authorize the employment of such military force as may become necessary, in pursuance of the provisions of the Act of Congress aforesaid, warning the offenders, moreover, that they will be prosecuted in all such other ways, as the law directs.
In testimony whereof, I have caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed to these presents, and signed the same with
[L. S.] my hand. Done at the city of Washington, the sixth day of March, in the year of
our Lord one thousand eight hundred and thirty, and of the independence of

the United States of America the fifty-fourth.

PROCLAMATION

BY ANDREW JACKSON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. Dec. 10, 1832.

Whe re as a convention assembled in the State of South Carolina, have passed an ordinance, by which they declare, " That the several acts and parts of acts of the Congress of the United States, purporting to be laws for the imposing offduties and imposts on the importation of foreign commodities, and now having actual operation and effect within the United States, and more especially," two acts for the same purposes, passed on the 19th of May, 1828, and on the 14th of July, 1832, "are unauthorized by the Constitution of the United States, and violate the true meaning and intent thereof, and are null and void, and no law," nor binding on the citizens of that State, or its officers; and by the said ordinance, it is further declared to be unlawful for any of the constituted authorities of the State, or of the United States, to enforce the payment of the duties imposed by the said acts, within the same State, and that it is the duty of the legislature to pass such laws as may be necessary to give full effect to the said ordinance:
And whereas, by the said ordinance, it is further ordained, that, in no case of law or equity decided in the courts of said State, wherein shall be drawn in question the validity of the said ordinance, or of the acts of the legislature that may be passed to give it effect, or of the said laws of the United States, no appeal shall be allowed to the Supreme Court of the United States, nor shall any copy of the record be permitted or allowed for that purpose, and that any person attempting to take such appeal shall be punished as for contempt of court:
And, finally, the said ordinance declares that the people of South Carolina will maintain the said ordinance at every hazard; and that they will consider the passage of any act, by Congress, abolishing or closing the ports of the said State, or otherwise obstructing the free ingress or egress of vessels to and from the said ports, or any other act of the Federal Government to coerce the State, shut up her ports, destroy or harass her commerce, or to. enforce the said acts otherwise than through the civil tribunals of the country, as inconsistent with the longer continuance of South Carolina in the Union; and that the people of the said State will thenceforth hold themselves absolved from all further obligation to maintain or preserve their political connection with the people of the other States, and will forthwith proceed to organize a separate government, and do all other acts and things which sovereign and independent States may of right do :
And whereas the said ordinance prescribes to the people of South Carolina a course of conduct in direct violation of their duty as citizens of the United
