(a) Under the provisions of the act of Congress, passed 26th May, 1824, ch. 173, proceedings were instituted in the superior court of the territory of Arkansas, by which a confirmation was claimed of a grant
of land alleged to have been made to the petitioner, Sampeyreac, by the Spanish government prior to their cession of Louisiana to the United States, by the treaty of April 3,1803. This claim was opposed by the district attorney of the United States, and the court, after hearing the evidence, decreed that the petitioner recover the land from the United States. Afterwards the district attorney of the United States, proceeding on the authority of the act of Congress, May 8, 1830, filed a bill of review, founded on the
allegation that the original decree was obtained by fraud and surprise; that the documents produced in support of the claim of Sampeyreac were forged, and that the witnesses who had been examined to sus-
tain the same were perjured. At a subsequent term Stewart was allowed to become a defendant to the bill of review, and filed an answer, in which the fraud and perjury are denied, and in which be asserts that if the same were committed he is ignorant thereof; and asserts that he is a bona fide purchaser of the
land, for a valuable consideration, from John J. Bowie, who conveyed to him the claim of Sampeyreac, by deed, dated the 22d October, 1828. On a final hearing the superior court of the territory of Arkansas, being satisfied of the forgery, perjury, and fraud, reversed the original decree. Held, by the Supreme Court of the United States, that those proceedings were legal, and were authorized by the act of May 5, 1830, ch. 90. Sampeyreac v. The United States, 7 Peters, 222.

(a) Under the provisions of the act of Congress, passed 26th May, 1824, ch. 173, proceedings were instituted in the superior court of the territory of Arkansas, by which a confirmation was claimed of a grant
of land alleged to have been made to the petitioner, Sampeyreac, by the Spanish government prior to their cession of Louisiana to the United States, by the treaty of April 3,1803. This claim was opposed by the district attorney of the United States, and the court, after hearing the evidence, decreed that the petitioner recover the land from the United States. Afterwards the district attorney of the United States, proceeding on the authority of the act of Congress, May 8, 1830, filed a bill of review, founded on the
allegation that the original decree was obtained by fraud and surprise; that the documents produced in support of the claim of Sampeyreac were forged, and that the witnesses who had been examined to sus-
tain the same were perjured. At a subsequent term Stewart was allowed to become a defendant to the bill of review, and filed an answer, in which the fraud and perjury are denied, and in which be asserts that if the same were committed he is ignorant thereof; and asserts that he is a bona fide purchaser of the
land, for a valuable consideration, from John J. Bowie, who conveyed to him the claim of Sampeyreac, by deed, dated the 22d October, 1828. On a final hearing the superior court of the territory of Arkansas, being satisfied of the forgery, perjury, and fraud, reversed the original decree. Held, by the Supreme Court of the United States, that those proceedings were legal, and were authorized by the act of May 5, 1830, ch. 90. Sampeyreac v. The United States, 7 Peters, 222.

(a) Under the provisions of the act of Congress, passed 26th May, 1824, ch. 173, proceedings were instituted in the superior court of the territory of Arkansas, by which a confirmation was claimed of a grant
of land alleged to have been made to the petitioner, Sampeyreac, by the Spanish government prior to their cession of Louisiana to the United States, by the treaty of April 3,1803. This claim was opposed by the district attorney of the United States, and the court, after hearing the evidence, decreed that the petitioner recover the land from the United States. Afterwards the district attorney of the United States, proceeding on the authority of the act of Congress, May 8, 1830, filed a bill of review, founded on the
allegation that the original decree was obtained by fraud and surprise; that the documents produced in support of the claim of Sampeyreac were forged, and that the witnesses who had been examined to sus-
tain the same were perjured. At a subsequent term Stewart was allowed to become a defendant to the bill of review, and filed an answer, in which the fraud and perjury are denied, and in which be asserts that if the same were committed he is ignorant thereof; and asserts that he is a bona fide purchaser of the
land, for a valuable consideration, from John J. Bowie, who conveyed to him the claim of Sampeyreac, by deed, dated the 22d October, 1828. On a final hearing the superior court of the territory of Arkansas, being satisfied of the forgery, perjury, and fraud, reversed the original decree. Held, by the Supreme Court of the United States, that those proceedings were legal, and were authorized by the act of May 5, 1830, ch. 90. Sampeyreac v. The United States, 7 Peters, 222.

And the surveyor general for the state of Louisiana shall be, and he is hereby, authorized to cause to be surveyed the tracts claimed by virtue of this section; and in all cases where, by reason of bends in the river, lake, creek, bayou, or water-course, bordering on the tract, and of adjacent claims of a similar nature, each claimant cannot obtain a tract equal in quantity to the adjacent tract already owned by him, to divide the vacant land applicable to that object between the several claimants, in such manner as to him will appear most
equitable: Provided, however, That the right of pre-emption granted by this section, shall not extend so far in depth as to include lands fit for cultivation, bordering on another river, creek, bayou or water-course. And every
person entitled to the benefit of this section shall, within three years after the date of this act, deliver to the register of the proper land office, a notice, in writing, stating the situation and extent of the tract of land he wishes to purchase; and shall also make the payment and payments for the same at the time and times which are or may be prescribed by law for the disposal of the other public lands in the said state, the time of his delivering the notice aforesaid being considered as the date of the pur-
chase : Provided, also, That all notices of claims shall be entered, and the money paid thereon, at least three weeks before such period as may
be designated by the President of the United Slates, for the public sale of the lands in the township in which such claims may be situated, and all claims not so entered shall be liable to be sold as other public lands. Whenever it shall be necessary to re-survey the public lands, in order to enable persons entitled to avail themselves of the provisions of this act, the expenses of such re-survey shall be paid by the person or persons, who shall enter the lands so re-surveyed under this act, at the time he or they shall pay the price of such land to the receiver of public money. And if any such person shall fail to deliver such notice within the said period of three years, or to make such payment or payments at the time above mentioned, his right of pre-emption shall cease, and become void; and the land may, thereafter, be purchased by any other person, in the same manner, and on the same terms, as are, or may be provided by law for the sale of other public lands in the said state.

Leaving this certificate out of the case, the instruments executed by the Baron de Carondelet, in 1795 and 1797, have not the aid of any authentic survey to ascertain and fix the limits of the land, and
to determine its location. Ibid. The Supreme Court has repeatedly decided, and in cases, too, where the instrument contained clear
words of grant, that if the descriptions were vague and indefinite, and there was no official survey to
give it a certain location, it could create no right of private property, in any particular parcel of land, which could be maintained in a court of justice. Ibid.
An equitable title is no defence in a suit brought by the United States. An imperfect title derived from Spain, before the cession, cannot be supported against a party claiming under a grant from the United States. Ibid.
The act of Congress of the 29th April, 1816, confirming the grant to the extent of a league square, restricted it to that quantity, and cannot be construed as confirming the residue. Ibid.
Query : Whether the acceptance by the claimant of this league square affected his title to the residue.

Under the act of Congress, ceding to Pennsylvania that part of the Cumberland road which is within the state, and the act of Pennsylvania accepting the surrender, a carriage, whenever it is carrying the mail, must be held to be laden with the property of the United States, within the true meaning
of the compact; and consequently exempted from payment of toll. Searight v. Stokes, 3 Howard, 151.
But this exemption does not apply to any other property conveyed in the same vehicle ; nor to any person travelling in it ; unless he is in the service of the United States, and passing along in pursu-
ance of orders from the proper authority. Ibid.
Nor can the United States claim an exemption for more carriages than are necessary for the safe,
speedy, and convenient carriage of the mail. Ibid.

Cha p. CXLIV.--An Act establishing land districts in the territory of Arkansas. (a) June 25, 1832.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America, in Congress assembled, That there shall be four land districts in the territory of Arkansas, to be called as follows, viz: the Arkansas land district, the White river land district, the Red river land district, and the Fayetteville land district; and each of the aforesaid land districts shall be bounded as follows, to wit: the Arkansas land district shall include all the country embraced within the following boundaries: beginning on the west bank of the Mississippi river, at the mouth of the St. Francis river, and running thence due west with the base line to the north-east corner of range six, township one north and south of said base line; thence, due north with the dividing line between ranges five and six, to the north-east corner of township seven, north of said base line; thence, due west with the dividing line between townships seven and eight, to the north-west corner of range seventeen; and thence, due south with the dividing line between ranges seventeen and eighteen, to the Mississippi river. The White river district shall include all the country south of Missouri, which is not included in the Arkansas land district above described, and east of the dividing line between ranges seventeen and eighteen, as extended from the northwest corner of thethesaid Arkansas land district, to the state of Missouri. The Red river land district shall include all the country in Arkansas lying west of the Arkansas land district, and south of the base line. The Fayetteville land district shall include the residue of the territory of Arkansas, being all the country lying north of the Red river district, and west of the Arkansas and White river districts.
Sec . 2. And be itfurther enacted, That the land office for the Arkansas land district shall be at Little Rock ; the land office for the White river district shall be at Batesville ; the land office for the Red river district shall be at the town of Washington: and the land office for the Fayetteville district shall be at Fayetteville.

Sec . 4. And be it further enacted, That for each of the said districts created by this act, a register and receiver of public moneys shall be appointed, who shall give security in the same manner, and whose duties and authorities shall, in every respect, be the same, in relation to the lands which shall be disposed of at their offices, as are by law provided in relation to the registers and receivers of public moneys in the several offices established for the sale of the public lands.

Cha p. CLXXX.--An Actfor the final adjustment of private land claims in Missouri. (a)
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America, in Congress assembled, That it shall be the duty of the
recorder of land titles in the state of Missouri and two commissioners

Statute I. July 9, 1832.
1833, ch. 84. All unconfirmed land claims to be examined.

(a) Notes of the decisions of the Supreme Court on land titles in Missouri. The state of Missouri was formerly part of the territory, first of France, next of Spain, then ofFrance, who ceded it to the United States by the treaty of 1803, in full propriety, sovereignty and dominion, as she had acquired and held it; by which this government put itself in place of the former sovereigns, and became invested with all their rights, subject to their concomitant obligations to the inhabitants. Both were regulated by the law of nations, according to which the rights of property are protected, even in the case of a conquered country; and held sacred and inviolable when it is ceded by treaty, with or without any stipulation to. such effect: and the laws, whether in writing, or evidenced by the usage and customs of the conquered or ceded country, continue in force, until altered by the new sovereign. Strother v. Lucas, 12 Peters, 410. No principle can be better established by the authority of the Supreme Court, than " that the acts of an officer, to whom a public duty is assigned by his king, within the sphere of that duty, are prima facie taken to be within his power." The principles on which it rests, are believed to be too deeply founded in law and reason, ever to be successfully assailed. He who would controvert a grant executed by the lawful authority, with all the solemnities required by law, takes on himself the burden of showing that the officer has transcended the powers conferred upon him; or that the transaction is tainted with fraud. Ibid.

Where the act of an officer to pass the title to land according to the Spanish law, is done contrary to the written order of the king, produced at the trial, without any explanation ; it shall be presumed that the power has not been exceeded ; that the act was done on the motive set out therein; and according to some order known to the king and his officers, though not to his subjects ; and courts ought to require very full proof, that he had transcended his powers, before they so determine it. Ibid.
In favour of long possession and ancient appropriation, every thing which was done shall be presumed to have been rightfully done ; and though it does not appear to have been done, the law will presume that whatever was necessary has been done. Ibid.

The stipulations of the treaty ceding Louisiana to the United States affording that protection or security to claims under the French or Spanish government to which the act of Congress refers, are in the first, second, and third articles. They extended to all property until Louisiana became a member of the Union ; into which the inhabitants were to be incorporated as soon as possible, " and admitted to all the rights, advantages and immunities of citizens of the United States." The perfect inviolability and security of property is among these rights. Delassus v. The United States, 9Peters, 117.
The right of property is protected and secured by the treaty, and no principle is better settled in this country, than that an inchoate title to lands is property. This right would have been sacred, independent of the treaty. The sovereign who acquires an inhabited country, acquires full dominion over it; but this dominion is never supposed to divest the vested rights of individuals to property. The language of the treaty ceding Louisiana, excludes any idea of interfering with private property. Ibid.
On the 18th of April, 1802, the lieutenant-governor of Upper Louisiana granted sixteen hundred arpents of land near certain rivers named in the grant, with directions to survey the same in a vacant place of the royal domain; but no survey was made before the cession of Louisiana to the United States. By the court--As the grant contained no description of the land granted, and was not located within the time prescribed by the act of Congress of the 10th of March, 1804, it comes directly within the point decided by the Supreme Court in the case of John Smith, T., and cannot be confirmed. Wherry v. The United States, 10 Peters, 338.

In repeated decisions the Supreme Court have affirmed the authority of local governors, under the

crown of Spain, to grant land in Louisiana, before the same was ceded by Spain to France : and the

court have also affirmed the validity of descriptive grants, though not surveyed before the 11th of March,

1804, in Missouri, and the 24th of January, 1818, in Florida. Mackey v. The United States.

10 Peters, 340.

'

A grant or concession made by an officer who is by law authorized to make it, carries with it prima facie evidence that it is within his powers. No excess of them, or departure from them, is to be presumed. He violates his duty by such excess, and is responsible for it. ' He who alleges that an officer intrusted with an important duty has violated his instructions, must show it. Delassus v. The United States, 9 Peters, 117.

The instructions of governor O'Reilly, relative to granting lands in Louisiana, were considered by the court in 8 Peters, 455. These regulations were intended for the general government of subordinate officers, and not to control and limit the power of the person from whose will they emanated. The Baron De Carondelet must be supposed to have had all the powers which had been vested in Don O'Reilly, and a concession ordered by him is as valid as a similar concession directed by governor O'Reilly would have been. Ibid.

A concession of land was made by the lieutenant-governor of Upper Louisiana, at the time when the power of granting lands was vested in the governors of provinces. This power was, in 1799, after the concession, transferred to the intendant-general: and after this transfer, in January, 1800, the order of survey of the land was made by the lieutenant-governor. The validity of the order of survey depends on the authority of the lieutenant-governor to make it. The lieutenant-governor was also a sub-delegate, and as such was empowered to make inchoate grants. The grant was confirmed. Chouteau's heirs v. the United States, 9 Peters, 137.

The transfer of the power to make concessions of lands belonging to the royal domain of Spain from the governor-general to the intendant-general, did not affect the power of the sub-delegate, who

made this concession. The order in this case is the foundation of title, and is, according to the act of

566

TWENTY-SECOND CONGRESS. Sess . I. Ch . 180. 1832.

Claims to be classed, &c.
Time for taking testimony.
Office of recorder to remain open for two years.
Recorder, &c., to proceed, &c.

to be appointed by the President of the United States, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to examine all the unconfirmed claims to land in that state, heretofore filed in the office of the said recorder, according to law, founded upon any incomplete grant, concession, warrant, or order of survey, issued by the authority of France or Spain, prior to the tenth day of March, one thousand eight hundred and four; and to class the same so as to show, first, what claims, in their opinion, would in fact have been confirmed, according to the laws, usages, and customs of the Spanish government, and the practice of the Spanish authorities under them, at New Orleans, if the government under which said claims originated had continued in Missouri; and secondly what claims, in their opinion, are destitute of merit, in law or equity, under such laws, usages, customs, and practice of the Spanish authorities aforesaid ; and shall also assign their reasons for the opinions so to be given. And in examining and classing such claims, the recorder and commissioners shall take into consideration, as well the testimony heretofore taken by the boards of commissioners and recorder of land titles upon those claims, as such other testimony as may be admissible under the rules heretofore existing for taking such testimony before said boards and recorder: and all such testimony shall be taken within twelve months after the passage of this act.
Sec . 2. And be it further enacted, That the office of the recorder shall be open for the purposes of such examination for the term of two years from the date of the organization of the board of commissioners and no longer; and the recorder and commissioners shall proceed in the examination in a summary manner, with or without any new application of

Congress on the subject of confirming titles to lands in Missouri, &c., and the general understanding and usage of Louisiana and Missouri, capable of being perfected into a complete title. It is property,
capable of being alienated, of being subjected to debts: and is, as such, to be held as sacred and inviolate as other property. Ibid.
A concession of one league square of land, in Upper Louisiana, was made by Don Zenon Trudeau,
the lieutenant-governor of that province, to Auguste Chouteau, and a decree made by him directing the surveyor-general of the province to put him in possession of the land, and to survey the same, in order to enable Chouteau to solicit a complete title thereto from the governor-general, who by the said decree
was informed that the circumstances of Chouteau were such as entitled him to a grant of the land. The land was surveyed, and the grantee put in full possession of it on the 20th of December, 1803. He retained possession of it until his death. The objection to the validity of the concession was, that the
petitioner had not as many tame cattle as the eighth regulation of governor O'Reilly, governor-general of Louisiana, required. That regulation required that the applicant for a grant of a league square of
land should make it appear that he is possessed of one hundred head of tame cattle, some horses and sheep, and two slaves to look after them, a proportion which shall always be observed for the grants,
&c. By the Court--In the spirit of the decisions which have been heretofore made by the Supreme Court, and of the acts of confirmation passed by Congress, the fact that the applicant possessed the requisite amount of property to entitle him to the land he solicited, was submitted to the officer who decided on the application ; and he is not bound to prove it to the court, which passes on the validity of the grant. These incomplete titles were transferable, and the assignee might not possess the means
of proving the exact number of cattle in possession of the petitioner when the concession was made.
The grant was confirmed. Ibid. 147. Ifthe court can trust the information received on this subject, neither the governor nor the intendant-
general has ever refused to perfect an incomplete title granted by a deputy-governor or a sub-delegate.
Ibid. The regulation made by Don O'Reilly, as to the quantity of land to be granted to an individual, is
not that no individual shall receive grants for more than one league square, but that no grant shall exceed a league square. The words of the regulation do not forbid different grants to the same person,
and, so far as the court are informed, it has never been so construed. Ibid. Under the act of February 17, 1815, ch. 45, a New Madrid certificate could be located upon lands
before they were offered for sale under a proclamation of the President, or even surveyed by the public
surveyor. Barry v. Gamble, 3 Howard, 32. The act of April 26, 1S22, ch. 40, recognised locations of this kind, although they disregarded the
sectional lines by which the surveys were afterwards made. Ibid. Under the acts of 1805, 1806, and 1807, it was necessary to file the evidence of an incomplete claim
under French and Spanish authority, which bore date anterior to 1800, as well as those which were dated subsequent to that day ; and in case of neglect, the bar provided applied to both of these classes. Ibid.
A title, resting on a permit and warrant of survey, dated before the 1st of October, 1800, without any settlement or survey having been made, was an incomplete title, and within those acts. Ibid.
And although the acts of 1824 and 1828 remove the bar as it respected the United States, yet having
excepted such lands as have been sold, or otherwise disposed of by the United States, and saved the
right or title of adverse claimants, these acts protected a New Madrid claim, which had been located
while this bar continued. Ibid.

the claimants; and shall, at the commencement of each session of Congress during said term of examination, lay before the commissioner of the general land office a report of the claims so classed, stating therein the date and quantity of each, whether there be any, and what, conflicting claims, and the evidence upon which each claim depends, and the
authority and power under which the said claim was granted by the Spanish or French governor, commandant or sub-delegate, to be laid before Congress for their final decision upon the claims contained in such first class.
Sec . 3. And be it further enacted, That from and after the final report of the recorder and commissioners, the lands contained in the second class shall be subject to sale as other public lands; and the lands contained in the first class shall continue to be reserved from sale as heretofore, until the decision of Congress shall be made thereon; and if the decision of Congress shall be against the claims, or any of them, the lands so decided against shall be, in like manner, subject to sale as other public lands: Provided, That actual settlers being housekeepers upon such lands as are rejected, claiming to hold, under such rejected claim, or such as may waive their grant, shall have the right of pre-emption to enter within the time of the existence of this act not exceeding the quantity of their claim, which in no case shall exceed six hundred and forty acres, to include their improvements, who shall give notice and prove their right of pre-emption, and in all things conform to the regulations as have been or may be prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury under the existing laws relative to pre-emption ; and it shall be the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury immediately to forward to the several land offices in said state, the manner in which all those who may wish to waive their several grants or claims, and avail themselves of the right of pre-emption, shall renounce or release their said grants.
Sec . 4. And be it further enacted, That the recorder and commis-
sioners shall each receive the sum of fifteen hundred dollars per annum, to be paid quarter yearly by the United States, in full compensation for their services under this act; and may, when necessary, employ an interpreter of the French or Spanish language, for a reasonable compensation, to be allowed by the Secretary of the Treasury, and paid by the United States.
Sec . 5. And be itfurther enacted, That it shall be lawful for the heirs of Carlos de Villemont to submit the evidence of their claim to a tract of land in Arkansas territory, to a place called " Chicot point," to the said recorder and commissioners, and it shall be the duty of said recorder and commissioners to report upon said claim in the manner that other claims provided for in this act are to be reported and proceeded upon.

If there is no informer, the United States have one-half, and the officers of the customs the other. If there is an informer, the informer has a fourth, and the custom-house officers a fourth.

Under the act of February 27, 1813, ch. 33, the Secretary of the Treasury had no authority to remit penalties for goods subsequently imported, contrary to the non-importation act. Under the act of March 3, 1797, ch. 13, the district judge is bound, upon a petition for remission, to state the facts, and not merely the evidence of the facts ; and the Secretary of the Treasury is bound by this statement of facts, and cannot legally act upon any other evidence.

The district judge, in stating such facts, acts judicially; and the proof before him must be made by competent, as well as credible testimony. A statement by the district judge that the claimant only swore to the facts before him, is no legal proof under the act of 1797, upon which the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to remit. Under the act of February 27, 1813, ch. 33, the Secretary of the Treasury had no authority to make a remission of part only of the property forfeited ; if he remitted at all, he was bound to remit the whole penalty or forfeiture. Neither under the act of 1797, nor the act of 1813, had the Secretary of the Treasury any authority to remit the collector's share of the forfeiture, nor any part of it, eo nomine. Ibid.
Fines imposed by the act of March 2, 1799, ch. 22, for obstructing officers of the customs, as well as penalties, are to be received by the collector of the customs, and distributed by him. Ex parte Marquand, 2 Gallis. C. C. R. 552.

Decisions of the courts of the United States on the remission and distribution of the proceeds of penalties and forfeitures :
Action of indebitatus assumpsit, was brought by the officers of therevenue cutter of the district of Delaware, for one half of the forfeiture incurred for a violation of the non-intercourse law, by a vessel seized by the collector of Delaware, on the information of the plaintiffs, and sent by him to the district
of Pennsylvania for trial, where she was condemned, and the amount of the forfeiture was received by the defendant, the collector of the port of Philadelphia. Held, 1st. The information to induce a seizure need not be as full as the evidence in the case would authorize to condemn. It is sufficient if it induced the prosecution. 2d. It is not necessary that the officers of therevenue cutter should, where they gave
the information, make a claim for a part of the forfeiture ; or that they should take any part in the prosecution of the case, to entitle them to a portion of the proceeds. 3d. The consent of the plaintiff's that
the vessel should be sent from the district of Delaware, to the district of Pennsylvania; or a disavowal by them, of having instituted this suit, does not constitute a waiver of their right to their share of the

act to provide for mitigating or remitting the forfeitures, penalties, and disabilities, accruing in certain cases therein mentioned," or in any act in addition to, or amendatory of said act, and not exceeding fifty dollars in amount, or value, the Secretary of the Treasury be, and he hereby
forfeiture. 4th. The defendant is not liable to the plaintiffs for such parts of the proceeds of the forfeiture as he had paid over to other officers of the custom-house for their shares, before notice of the claims of the plaintiffs. Sawyer et al. v. Steele, 3 Wash. C. C. R. 464.
A bond was given to T. S., the collector of the district of Petersburg, under the second section of the embargo act of the 22d of December, 1807, and a suit was afterwards brought by him on the same bond in the district court; and pending the proceedings, to wit, on the 30th of October, 1S11, J. S., the collector, died ; and judgment was recovered in favour of the United States, on the 30th of November, 1811. On the 26th of the same November, J. J. was appointed collector of the same district, and entered on the duties of his office on the 14th of December, 1811 ; until which time T. S., who was deputy collector under J. S., at his decease, continued as such to discharge the duties of the office. The judgment of the district court was subsequently affirmed by the circuit court. When the bond was taken, A. T. was surveyor of the district, and continued in that office until his death, which was after the commencement of the suit oh the bond, and before judgment thereon, and was succeeded by J. H. P., who was appointed on the 30th of March, 1811, and entered on the duties of his office on the 16th of the same month. It was held, that the personal representatives of the deceased collector and surveyor, and not their successors in office, were entitled to that portion of the penalty which is, by law, to be distributed among the revenue officers of the district where it was incurred. There being no naval officer in the district, the division was adjudged to be made in equal proportions between the collector and surveyor. Jones and others v. Shore's Executors and others, 1 Wheat. 462; 3 Cond. Rep. 624.
The Secretary of the Treasury has authority, under the remission act of the 3d of March, 1797, ch. 13, to remit a forfeiture or penalty accruing under the revenue laws, at any time, before or after a final sentence of condemnation or judgment for the penalty, until the money is actually paid over to the collector for distribution. United States v. Morris, 10 Wheat. 246; 6 Cond. Rep. 90.
Such remission extends to the shares of the forfeiture or penalty to which the officers of the customs are entitled, as well as to the interest of the United States. Ibid.
The ship Good Friends, and her cargo of British merchandise, owned by Stephen Girard, a citizen of the United States, was seized by the collector ofthe Delaware district, on the 19th ofApril, 1812, for a violation of the non-intercourse laws ofthe United States then in force. The ship and cargo were condemned as forfeited, in the district and circuit court ofthe Delaware district. On the 29th July, 1813, Congress passed "An act for the relief of the owners of the Good Friends," &c., and a remission of the forfeiture was granted by the Secretary of the Treasury, under the authority of that act, with the exception of a sum equal to the double duties imposed by an act of Congress passed on the 1st of July, 1812. The collector was entitled to one moiety of the whole amount reserved by the Secretary of the Treasury, as the condition of the remission. M'Lane v. The United States, 6 Peters, 404.
Where a sentence ofcondemnation has been finally pronounced in a case of seizure, the Supreme Court, as an incident to the possession of the principal cause, has a right to proceed to decree a distribution of the proceeds, according to the terms prescribed by law. And it is a familiar practice to institute proceedings for the purpose of such distribution, whenever a doubt occurs as to the rights of the parties, who are entitled to share in the distribution. Ibid.
The duty of the collector in superintending the collection of the revenue, and of making seizures for supposed violations of law, is onerous and full of perplexity. If he seizes any goods, it is at his own peril ; and he is condemnable in damages and costs, if it should turn out upon the final adjudication, that there was no probable cause for the seizure. As a just reward for his diligence, and a compensation for his risks; at once to stimulate his vigilance and secure his activity, the laws of the United States have awarded to him a large share of the proceeds of the forfeiture. But his right by the seizure is but inchoate; and although the forfeiture may have been justly incurred, yet the government has reserved to itself the right to release it, either in whole or in part, until the proceeds have been actually received for distribution ; and in that event, and to that extent, it displaces the right of the collector. Such was the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of the United States v. Morris, 10 Wheat. 246. Ibid.
But whatever is reserved to the government out of the forfeiture, is reserved as well for the seizing officer, as for itself; and is distributable accordingly. The government has no authority, under its existing laws, to release the collector's share, as such, and yet to retain to itself the other part of the forfeiture. Ibid.
In point of law, no duties, as such, can legally accrue upon the importation of prohibited goods. They are not entitled to entry at the custom-house, or to be bonded. They are, ipso facto, forfeited by the mere act of importation. Ibid.
The Secretary of the Treasury may remit not only the interest of the United States, but of individuals, in penalties and forfeitures in certain cases, after suit brought, and before judgment. United States v. Lancaster, 4 Wash. C. C. R. 64.
A pardon of the President of the United States, after condemnation, as to all the interest of the United States, in the penalty incurred by a violation of the embargo laws, and directing all further proceedings on behalf of the United States to be discontinued, does not remit the interest of the customhouse officers in a moiety. Ibid.
Under the 91st section of the duty act of March 2d, 1799, ch. 22, the share of a forfeiture to which the collector, &c., of the district is entitled, is to be paid to the person who was the collector, &c., in the office at the time the seizure was made ; and not to his successor in office at the time of condemnation, and the receipt of the money. Buel v. Van Ness, 8 Wheat. 312 ; 5 Cond. Rep. 445.
Until final judgment, no part of the forfeiture vests absolutely in the collector; but after final judgment, his share vests absolutely, and cannot be remitted by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Hollen, 1 Mason's C. C. R. 431.
If, pending the proceedings, a remission be made of the whole property forfeited, the whole title of

is authorized, if in his opinion the said fine, penalty, or forfeiture was incurred without wilful negligence or intention of fraud, to prescribe such rules and mode of proceeding, to ascertain the facts, as in his opinion may be convenient and proper, without regard to the provisions of the act above referred to; and upon the said facts, so to be ascertained as aforesaid, the said secretary may exercise all the power conferred upon him in and by said act, as fully as he might have done had said facts been ascertained under and according to the provisions of said act.

the collector is gone ; if of a part only, his title attaches to the remainder, and, by a judgment of condemnation, becomes fixed and indissoluble. The Margaretta, 2 Gallis. C. C. R. 515.
If there is no informer, the United States have one-half, and the officers of the customs the other. If there is an informer, the informer has a fourth, and the custom-house officers a fourth. If the informer is an officer of a revenue cutter, the United States have a fourth, one-fourth to the custom-house officers, and the officer of the revenue cutter one-half. Sawyer et al. v. Steele, 3 Wash. C. C. R. 464.
The consent of the claimants that the vessel should be sent into another district for adjudication, or a disavowal by them of having instituted the suit, does not amount to a waiver by them, of their right to a share of the forfeiture. Ibid.
But the collector is not responsible for such part of the forfeiture as he may have paid over, bona fide, to other officers, for their shares, before notice of the plaintiff's claim. Ibid.
The Secretary of the Treasury has no power to remit penalties, unless in cases provided for by law. If he recites his authority under a special act, and remits in pursuance of that act, the remission, if unsupported by that act, cannot be supported under the general act of March 3, 1797, ch. 13. Under the act of February 27, 1813, ch. 33, the Secretary of the Treasury had no authority to remit penalties for goods subsequently imported, contrary to the non-importation act. Under the act of March 3, 1797, ch. 13, the district judge is bound, upon a petition for remission, to state the facts, and not merely the evidence of the facts ; and the Secretary of the Treasury is bound by this statement of facts, and cannot legally act upon any other evidence. The Margaretta, 2 Gallis. C. C. R. 515.
The district judge, in stating such facts, acts judicially; and the proof before him must be made by competent, as well as credible testimony. A statement by the district judge that the claimant only swore to the facts before him, is no legal proof under the act of 1797, upon which the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to remit. Under the act of February 27, 1813, ch. 33, the Secretary of the Treasury had no authority to make a remission of part only of the property forfeited ; if he remitted at all, he was bound to remit the whole penalty or forfeiture. Neither under the act of 1797, nor the act of 1813, had the Secretary of the Treasury any authority to remit the collector's share of the forfeiture, nor any part of it, eo nomine. Ibid.
Fines imposed by the act of March 2, 1799, ch. 22, for obstructing officers of the customs, as well as penalties, are to be received by the collector of the customs, and distributed by him. Ex parte Marquand, 2 Gallis. C. C. R. 552.

(a) Under the act of Congress passed July 14, 1832, ch. 227,entitled " An act to alter and amend the several acts imposing duties on imports," worsted shawls with cotton borders, and worsted suspen-
ders with cotton straps or ends, are not subjected to a duty of fifty per cent, ad valorem. Elliott v.
Swartwout, 10 Peters, 137. Laws imposing duties on goods are intended for practical use and application by men engaged in
commerce, and hence it has become a settled rule in the interpretation of statutes of this description to construe the language adopted by the legislature, and particularly in the denomination of articles, ac-
cording to the commercial understanding of the terms used. Ibid.
Construction of statutes: The principles applied in the courts of the United States, in relation to the construction of statutes
of the United States, and of statutes in general. The suspension of a statute for a limited time, is not a repeal of it. Brown, plaintiff in error, v. Barry,
3 Dall. 365 ; 1 Cond. Rep. 165. The intention of the legislature, when discovered, must prevail; any rule of construction, declared
by previous acts, to the contrary notwithstanding. Ibid. The presumption must always be in favour ofthe validity of a law if the contrary is not clearly demon-
strated. Cooper v. Telfair, 4 Dall. 14; 1 Cond. Rep. 211. A legislative act founded on a mistaken opinion of what was law, does not change the actual state
of the law, as to pre-existing cases. Talbot v. Seeman, 1 Cranch 1 ; 1 Cond. Rep. 229. It is true, that in mere private cases between individuals, a court will and ought to struggle hard
against, a construction, which will, by a retrospective operation, affect the rights of parties ; bul in great national concerns, where individual rights acquired by war are sacrificed for national purposes, the contract making the sacrifice ought always to receive a construction conforming to its manifest import; and if the nation has given up the vested rights of its citizens, it is not for the court, hut for the government, to consider whether it be a case proper for compensation. United States v. The Schooner
Peggy. 1 Cranch, 103; 1 Cond. Rep. 256.  If courts are to regard the constitution, and the constitution is superior to any ordinary act of the
legislature; the constitution, and not such ordinary act, must govern the case to which they both apply.
Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch, 137 ; 1 Cond. Rep. 267. In the construction of a statute, positive and explicit provisions, comprehending in terms a whole
class of cases, are not to be restrained by applying to those cases an implication drawn from subsequent words ; unless that implication be very clear, necessary, and irresistible. Faw v. Marsteller, 2 Cranch,
10 ; 1 Cond. Rep. 337. Where a case is shown to be out of the mischief intended to be guarded against, or out of the spirit
of the law ; the letter of the statute will not be deemed so unequivocal as absolutely to exclude another
construction. Ibid. It is said the case ought to be an extraordinary one, that the circumstances ought to be uncommon,
which would warrant a departure from the general principles established for the government of contracts. This is true, and the Supreme Court would certainly not feel itself at liberty to exercise, on a common occasion, a discretionary power, limited only by the opinion entertained of the naked justice
of the case. Ibid. That a law is the best expositor of itself; that every part of an act is to be taken into view for the
purpose of discovering the mind of the legislature ; and that the details of one part may contain regulations restricting the extent of general expressions used in another part of the same act; are among those plain rules laid down by common sense for the exposition of statutes, which have been uniformly
acknowledged. Pennington v. Coxe, 2 Cranch, 33 ; 1 Cond. Rep. 346. It is undoubtedly a well-established principle in the exposition of statutes, that every part is to be
considered, and the intention of the legislature to be extracted from the whole. It is also true that

Third. On all manufactures of cotton, or of which cotton shall be a component part, twenty-five per centum ad valorem, excepting cotton twist, yarn, and thread, which shall remain at the rate of duty fixed by the act to amend the several acts imposing duties on imports, of twenty-

Manufactures of cotton, or of part cotton.
1824, ch. 136.

where great inconvenience will result from a particular construction, that construction is to be avoided; unless the meaning of the legislature be plain ; in which case it must be obeyed. United States v.
Fisher et al., Assignees of Blight, 2 Cranch, 358 ; 1 Cond. Rep. 421. That the consequences are to be considered in expounding laws, where the intent is doubtful, is a
principle not to be contradicted; but it is also true, that it is a principle which must be applied with caution; and which has a degree of influence dependent on the nature of the case to which it is applied, when
rights are infringed. Ibid. Where fundamental principles are overthrown, where the general system of the laws is departed from,
the legislative intention must be expressed with irresistible clearness, to induce a court of justice to suppose a design to effect such objects. But when only a political regulation is made which is inconvenient ; if the intention of the legislature be expressed in terms which are sufficiently intelligible to leave no doubt in the mind, when the words are taken in their ordinary sense ; it would be going a great way to say that a constrained interpretation must be put upon them, to avoid an inconvenience which ought to have been contemplated in the legislature, when the act was passed; and which, in their opinion, was probably overbalanced by the particular advantages it was calculated to produce. Ibid.
In cases depending on the statutes of a state, the settled construction of these statutes, by the state courts, is to be regarded. Polk's Lessee v. Wendal, 9 Cranch, 87; 3 Cond. Rep. 286.
In the construction of the statutes or local laws of a state, it is frequently necessary to recur to the history and situation of the country, in order to ascertain the reason as well as the meaning of many of them, to enable a court to apply with propriety the different rules for construing statutes. Preston
v. Browder, 1 Wheat. 115 ; 3 Cond. Rep. 508. The best judges in England have been of opinion, that relaxing the construction of the statute of
frauds ought not to be extended further than it has already been carried ; and the Supreme Court entirely concurs in that opinion. Grant v. Naylor, 4 Cranch, 224 ; 2 Cond. Rep. 95.
An act of Congress ought never to be construed to violate the law of nations, if any other possible construction remains; and consequently can never be construed to violate neutral rights, or to affect neutral commerce, further than is warranted by the law of nations, as understood in this country. Mur-
ray v. The Charming Betsey, 2 Cranch, 64; 1 Cond. Rep. 358. When an act of Congress is revived by a subsequent act, it is revived precisely in that form, and with
that effect, which it had at the moment when it expired. The cargo of the Brig Aurora v. The United
States, 7 Cranch, 382 ; 2 Cond. Rep. 540. It is a general rule, in the construction of public statutes, that the word " may" is to be construed must," in all cases where the legislature mean to impose a positive and absolute duty, and not merely
to give a discretionary power. And in all cases, the construction should be such as carries into effect the true intent and meaning of the legislature in the enactment. Minor et al. v. The Mechanics' Bank of Alexandria, 1 Peters, 46.
Where English statutes, such for instance as the statute of frauds, and the statute of limitations, have been adopted into our own legislation ; the known and settled construction of those statutes by English courts of law has been considered as silently incorporated into the acts; or has been received with
all the weight-of authority. Pennock v. Dialogue et al., 2 Peters, 1. Where the question upon the construction of the statute of a state relative to real property has been
settled by any judicial decision in the state where the land lies; the Supreme Court, upon the uniform principles adopted by it, would recognise that decision as a part of the local law. Gardner v. Collins, 2 Peters, 58.
A legislative act is to be interpreted according to the intention of the legislature, apparent upon its face. Every technical rule as to the construction or force of particular terms, must yield to the clear expression of the paramount will of the legislature. Wilkinson v. Leland et al., 2 Peters, 627.
In cases not absolutely closed by authority, the Supreme Court has always expressed a strong inclination not to extend the operation of the statute of frauds so as to embrace original and distinct promises, made by different persons at the same time, upon the same general consideration. Townsley v. Sumrall, 2 Peters, 182.
The Supreme Court has been often called upon to consider the sixteenth section of the judiciary act of 1789, and as often, either expressly or by the course of its decisions, has held that it is merely declaratory ; making no alteration whatever in the rules of equity on the subject of legal remedy. Boyce's
Executors v. Grundy, 3 Peters, 210. The rule which has uniformly been observed by the Supreme Court in construing statutes, is to adopt
the construction made by courts of the country, by whose legislature the statute was enacted. This rule may be susceptible of some modification, when applied to British statutes which are adopted in any of the states. By adopting them they become our own, as entirely as if they had been enacted by the legislature of the state. Cathcart et al. v. Robinson, 5 Peters, 264.
The construction which British statutes had received in England at the time of their adoption in this country, indeed to the time ofthe separation of this country from the British empire, may very properly be considered as accompanying the statutes themselves, and forming an integral part of them. But however subsequent decisions may be respected, and certainly they are entitled to great respect, their absolute authority is not admitted. If the English courts vary their construction of a statute which is common to both countries, we do not hold ourselves bound to fluctuate with them. Ibid.
Generally statutes are to be construed to operate in futuro, unless a retrospective effect be clearly intended. Prince v. The United States, 2 Gallis. C. C. R. 204.
The word ` or' has sometimes been construed to mean ` and.' Such construction has been clearly necessary to give effect to a clause in a will, or to some legislative provision, but never to change a contract at pleasure. Douglass v. Eyre, Gilpin's D, C. R. 148.

second May, one thousand eight hundred and twenty-four ; And provided, That all manufactures of cotton, or of which cotton shall be a component part, not dyed, colored, printed, or stained, not exceeding in value thirty cents the square yard, shall be valued at thirty cents per square

Where a British statute is re-enacted in this country, it is reasonable to suppose that the legislature designed to adopt, as well the settled construction which had been given to the act by the British courts, as the act itself. Kirkpatrick et al. v. Gibson's Executors, 2 Brockenb. C. C. R. 388.
In doubtful cases, a court should compare all the parts of a statute, and different statutes in pari ma-
teria, to ascertain the intention of the legislature. The Sloop Elizabeth, Paines's C. C. R. 11. Semble : That in questions of commercial law the courts of the United States are not concluded by
the local construction proceeding from state courts. Donnell v. The American Ins. Co., 2 Sumner's C. C. R. 366.
In the construction of statutes, one part must be construed by another. In order to attest the legislative intention, the whole statute must be inspected. Strode v. Stafford Justices, 1 Brockenb. C. C. R. 162.
It is a rule of law that a statute applicable in its terms to particular actions, cannot be applied by construction to other actions standing on the same reasons. Jacob v. The United States, 1 Brockenb. C. C. R. 520.
Penal laws must be construed strictly to bring the case within the definition of the law, but not so as to exclude a case within their ordinary acceptation. The United States v. Wilson and Porter, 1 Baldwin's C. C. R. 78.
Laws are construed strictly to save a right, or avoid a penalty; and liberally to give a remedy, or effect an object declared in the law. Whitney et al. v. Emmett et al., 1 Baldwin's C. C. R. 316.
The provisions of a law which are merely directory, are not to be construed into conditions precedent. Ibid.
The mercantile terms are to be taken in the sense intended, which is to be ascertained by the laws in pari materia. The United States v. Twenty-four Coils of Cordage, 1 Baldwin's C. C. R. 505.
The words of a law imposing a forfeiture or penalty, should not be construed to embrace a case not within the parts of the law which prohibits the act done, or direct the performance of an act, by the omission of which the penalty or forfeiture is incurred. Ibid. 508.
If a section of an act of Congress admits of two interpretations, one of which brings it within, and the other pushes it beyond the constitutional authority of Congress ; it is the duty of the Supreme Court to adopt the former construction; because a presumption never ought to be indulged, that Congress meant to exercise or usurp any unconstitutional authority ; unless that construction is forced on the court by language altogether incongruous. The United States v. Combe, 12 Peters, 72.
Upon the genera] principles of interpreting statutes, when the words are general, the court are not at liberty to insert limitations not called for by the sense, or the objects, or the mischiefs of the enactment. Ibid.
The office of a proviso, generally, is either to except something from the enacting clause, or to qualify or restrain its generality, or to exclude some possible ground of misinterpretation of its extending to cases not intended by the legislature to be brought within its purview. Ibid.
The court in construing an act will not consider the motives, or reasons, or opinions, expressed by individual members of Congress in debate, but will look, if necessary, to the public history of the times in which it was passed. Aldridge et al. v. Williams, 3 Howard, 1.
An act of Congress imposing a duty upon imports, must be construed to describe the article upon which the duty is imposed according to the commercial understanding of the terms used in the law, in our own markets, at the time when the law was passed. Curtis v. Martin, 3 Howard, 106.
Revenue laws for the prevention of fraud, for the suppression of a public wrong, or to effect a public good, are not in a strict sense, penal statutes, although they impose a penalty. But they ought to be so construed as most effectually to accomplish the intention of the legislature, in passing them, instead of being construed with great strictness in favour of the defendant. Taylor et al. v. The United States, 3 Howard, 197.
A clause of forfeiture in a law is to be construed differently from a similar clause in an engagement between individuals. A legislature may impose it as a punishment, but individuals can only make it a matter of contract. The State ofMaryland v. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, 3 Howard, 534.
Statutes in pari materia, should be taken into consideration in construing a law. If a thing contained in a subsequent statute be within the reason of a former statute, it shall be taken to be within the meaning of that statute. The United States v. Freeman, 3 Howard, 556.
If it can be gathered from a subsequent statute in pari materia, what meaning the legislature attached to the words of a former statute, this will amount to a legislative declaration of its meaning, and will govern the construction of the first statute. Ibid.
The meaning of the legislature may be extended beyond the precise words used in the law, from the reason or motive on which the legislature proceeded, from the end in view, or the purpose which was designed ; the limitation of the rule being that to extend the meaning in any case not included within the words, the case must be shown to come within the same reason upon which the law-maker proceeded, and not a like reason. Ibid.
In affirmative statutes, such part of a prior as may be incorporated into the subsequent statute, as consistent with it, must be considered in force. Davies v. Fairbairn, 3 Howard, 636.
If a subsequent statute be not repugnant in all its provisions to a prior one, yet if the latter statute clearly intended to prescribe the only rules which should govern, it repeals the prior one. Ibid.
In the construction of penal statutes, the proper course is to search out and follow the true intent of the legislature and to adopt that sense which harmonizes best with the context, and promotes, in the fullest manner, the apparent policy and objects of the legislature. The United States v. Weaver, 3 Sumner's C. C. R. 208.
In construing an act of Congress, if there be a mistake apparent on the face of the act, which may

On round iron or brazier's rods, of three-sixteenths to eightsixteenths of an inch diameter, inclusive, and on iron in nail or spike rods, or nail plates, slit, rolled, or hammered, and on iron in sheets, and hoop iron, and on iron, slit, rolled, or hammered for band iron, scroll iron, or casement rods, three cents per pound; on iron spikes, four cents per pound; on iron nails, cut or wrought, five cents per pound; on tacks, brads, and sprigs, not exceeding sixteen ounces to the thousand, five cents per thousand; exceeding sixteen ounces to the thousand, five cents per pound; on square wire used for the manufacture of stretchers for umbrellas, and cut in pieces not exceeding the length used therefor, twelve per centum ad valorem; on anvils and anchors, and all parts thereof, manufactured in whole or in part, two cents per pound; on iron cables or chains, or parts thereof, manufactured in whole or in part, three cents per pound, and no drawback shall be allowed on the exportation of iron cables or parts thereof; on mill cranks and mill irons of wrought iron, four cents per pound; on mill saws, one dollar each; on blacksmith's hammers and sledges, two and a half cents per pound; on muskets, one dollar and fifty cents per stand; on rifles, two dollars and fifty cents each; on all other firearms, thirty per centum ad valorem.

be corrected by other language in the act itself, the mistake is not fatal. Blanchard v. Sprague, 3 Sumner's C. C. R. 279.
But where the descriptive words constitute the very essence of the act, unless the description is so clear and accurate as to refer to the particular subject intended, and be incapable of being applied to any other, the mistake is fatal. Ibid.
There is no case where the court in the construction of a statute has substituted other words and other dates, in order to maintain an act making erroneous references to things aliunde. Ibid.
The judiciary act of 1789, ch. 20, sec. 32, gives no authority to the courts of the United States to make any amendments in judgments except as to defects in want of form. Albers v. Whitney, 1 Story C. C. R. 310.
Although penal statutes are to be construed strictly, yet all the provisions thereof must be taken together, and interpreted according to the import of the words, and not by the mere division into
sections, so as to give effect to the object and intent of the statute, and all statutes relating to the same subject matter are to be interpreted together, and such a construction is to be given to them, consistent with the words, as will avoid the mischief, and promote the objects and policy contemplated by the statutes. The Schooner Harriet, 1 Story C. C. R. 251.
The tariff, being a statute regulating commerce, the terms of it must be construed according to commercial usage. Bacon v. Bancroft, 1 Story C. C. R. 341.

Sixteenth. On brown sugar and syrup of sugar cane, in casks, two and a half cents per pound; and on white clayed sugar, three and onethird cents per pound. (b)

(a) An act of Congress imposing a duty on imports, must be construed to describe the article upon which the duty is imposed according to the commercial understanding of the, terms used in the law, in our own markets, at the time when the law was passed. Curtis v. Martin et al., 3 Howard, 106.
The duty, therefore, imposed by the act of 1832, upon cotton bagging, cannot properly be levied upon an article which was not known in the market as cotton bagging in 1832, although it may subsequently be called so. Ibid.
(b) A seizure was made in the port of New Orleans, under the sixty-seventh section of the act of March 2, 1799, ch. 22, regulating the collection of duties, which authorizes the collector, when he shall suspect a false and fraudulent entry to have been made of any goods, wares, and merchandise, to cause an examination to be made ; and if found to differ from the entry, the merchandise is to be forfeited, unless it shall be
made to appear to the collector, or to the court in which a prosecution for the forfeiture shall be had, that such difference proceeded from accident or mistake, and not from an intention to defraud the revenue. The United States, by the collector ofMississippi, seized, as falsely entered at the custom-house in New Orleans, certain casks of sugar, which had been entered as " syrup," alleging that they were sugar, in a partial solution in water. The libel charged the entry to have been made with a fraudulent intention of evading the duty on sugar. The claimant gave evidence tending to show that the article seized was, in the prevailing mercantile understanding of the term, deemed syrup, and not sugar. By the Court:--The denomination of merchandise, subject to the payment of duties, is to be understood in a commercial sense, although it may not be scientifically correct.

Wher eas the said band of Wyandots have become fully convinced that, whilst they remain in their present situation in the State of Ohio, in the vicinity of a white population, which is continually increasing and crowding around them, they cannot prosper and be happy, and the morals of many of their people will be daily becoming more and more vitiated--And understanding that the Government of the United States is willing to purchase the reservation of land on which they reside, and for that purpose have deputed the said James B. Gardiner as special commissioner to treat for a cession of the same: -- Therefore, to effect the aforesaid objects, the said Chiefs, Headmen and Warriors, and the said James B. Gardiner, have this day entered into and agreed upon the following articles of convention.
Arti cle I. The band of Wyffridots residing at the Big Spring in the county of Crawford, and State of Ohio, do hereby forever cede and relinquish to the United States the reservation of sixteen thousand acres of land, granted to them by the second article of the treaty made at St. Mary's, on the seventeenth day of September, eighteen hundred and eighteen, which grant is in the following words, to wit: "There shall be reserved for the use of the Wyandots residing at Solomon's town and on Blanchard's fork sixteen thousand acres of land, to be laid off in a square form, on the head of Blanchard's fork, the centre of which shall be at the Big spring, on the road leading from Upper Sandusky to Fort Findlay."
Article II. The United States stipulate with the said band of Wyandots that, as soon as practicable after the ratification of this treaty, the aforesaid tract of sixteen thousand acres shall be surveyed into sections and put into market and sold in the ordinary manner of selling the public lands of the United States; and when the same shall be sold, or as soon as any part thereof shall be disposed of, (be the price received therefor more or less) there shall be paid to the chiefs, head-men and warriors, signing this treaty, for the benefit of all the said band of Wyandots, the sum of one dollar and twenty-five cents per acre for each and every acre so sold or for sale. The said price shall be paid in silver, and in the current coin of the United States.
Arti cle III. For the improvements now made upon said reservation the United States agree to pay a fair valuation in money, according to the appraisement of Joseph McCutcheon, Esq. (or such person as the

Secretary of War may depute for that purpose) and an appraiser to be chosen by the said band of Wyandots. And in case the said appraisers shall not be able to agree upon any of their valuations, they shall call to their assistance some competent citizen of the county of Crawford.

Arti cle IV. There shall [be] reserved for Roe-nu-nas, one of the Reservation for oldest chiefs of said band, one half section, to contain three hundred Roe-nu-nas. and twenty acres, and to include the improvements where he now lives.

Removal.

Article V* I. It was expressly agreed before the signing of this treaty, that that part of the fifth article relating to the granting to the said band of Wyandots lands west of the Mississippi, and every other article in relation thereto is wholly null and void, and of no effect.

Art icl e VII. Inasmuch as the band of Wyandots, herein treating,
have separated themselves from the Wyandots at Upper Sandusky and
on the Sandusky plains, they ask of the General Government that there may be a special sub-agent and protector appointed for them whilst they
remain in the State of Ohio, and they respectfully recommend Joseph McCutcheon, Esq. of the county of Crawford, as a fit and proper person to act in such capacity; and that he may have the power to employ
such interpreter as he may think proper in his intercourse with said band.

Special subagent.

The aforesaid articles of agreement shall be mutually binding upon Treaty binding the present contracting parties, when ratified by the President of the when ratified. United States, by and with the consent of the Senate thereof.

EXPLANATION.

In the first draft of this treaty, provision was made for the removal

of the band west of the Mississippi, but they refused to accept of a

grant of land, or to remove there, and the articles having relation thereto

were accordingly omitted. It was therefore necessary to omit the 6th

article; and circumstances did not admit of time to remodel and copy

the whole treaty.

ARTICLES OF A TREATY

Made and entered into between Genl. John Coffee, being duly authorised thereto, by the President of the United States, and the whole Chickasaw Nation, in General Council assembled, at the Council House, on Pontitock Creek on the twentieth day of October, 1832.

Oct. 20, 1832. Proclamation, March 1, 1833.

The Chickasaw Nation find themselves oppressed in their present situation ; by being made subject to the laws of the States in which they reside. Being ignorant of the language and laws of the white man, they cannot understand or obey them. Rather than submit to this great
evil, they prefer to seek a home in the west, where they may live and be governed by their own laws. And believing that they can procure
for themselves a home, in a country suited to their wants and condition,

Preamble.

ARTICLES OF A TREATY OF PEACE, FRIENDSHIP AND CESSION,

Sept. 21, 1832.
Proclamation, Feb. 13, 1833.

Concluded at Fort Armstrong, Rock Island, Illinois, between the United States of America, by their Commissioners, Major General Winfield Scott, of the United States Army, and his Excellency John Reynolds., Governor of the State of Illinois, and the confederated tribes of Sac and Fox Indians, represented, in general Council, by the undersigned Chiefs, Headmen and Warriors.

Cession to the United States.
Agreement to remove, &c.
Reservation.

Where as , under certain lawless and desperate leaders, a formidable band, constituting a large portion of the Sac and Fox nation, left their country in April last, and, in violation of treaties, commenced an unprovoked war upon unsuspecting and defenceless citizens of the United States, sparing neither age nor sex; and whereas, the United States, at a great expense of treasure, have subdued the said hostile band, killing or capturing all its principal Chiefs and Warriors -- the said States, partly as indemnity for the expense incurred, and partly to secure the future safety and tranquillity of the invaded frontier, demand of the said tribes, to the use of the United States, a cession of a tract of the Sac and Fox country, bordering on said frontier, more than proportional to the numbers of the hostile band who have been so conquered and subdued.
Art icl e I. Accordingly, the confederated tribes of Sacs and Foxes hereby cede to the United States forever, all the lands to which the said tribes have title, or claim, (with the exception of the reservation hereinafter made,) included within the following bounds, to wit: Beginning on the Mississippi river, at the point where the Sac and Fox northern boundary line, as established by the second article of the treaty of Prairie du Chien, of the fifteenth of July, one thousand eight hundred and thirty, strikes said river; thence, up said boundary line to a point fifty miles from the Mississippi, measured on said line; thence, in a right line to the nearest point on the Red Cedar of the loway, forty miles from the Mississippi river; thence, in a right Jine to a point in the northern boundary line of the State of Missouri, fifty miles, measured on said boundary, from the Mississippi river; thence, by the last mentioned boundary to the Mississippi river, and by the western shore of said river to the place of beginning. And the said confederated tribes of Sacs and Foxes hereby stipulate and agree to remove from the lands herein ceded to the United States, on or before the first day of June next; and, in order to prevent any future misunderstanding, it is expressly understood, that no band or party of the Sac or Fox tribes shall reside, plant, fish, or hunt on any portion of the ceded country after the period just mentioned.
Art icl e IL Out of the cession made in the preceding article, the United States agree to a reservation for the use of the said confederated tribes, of a tract of land containing four hundred square miles, to be laid off under the directions of the President of the United States, from the boundary line crossing the loway river, in such manner that nearly an equal portion of the reservation may be on both sides of said river,
(374)

TREATY WITH THE SACS AND FOXES. 1832.

and extending downwards, so as to include Ke-o-kuck's principal village on its right bank, which village is about twelve miles from the Mississippi river.
Art icl e III. In consideration of the great extent of the foregoing cession, the United States stipulate and agree to pay to the said confederated tribes, annually, for thirty successive years, the first payment to be made in September of the next year, the sum of twenty thousand dollars in specie.
Arti cle IV. It is further agreed that the United States shall establish and maintain within the limits, and for the use and benefit of the Sacs and Foxes, for the period of thirty years, one additional black and gun smith shop, with the necessary tools, iron and steel; and finally make a yearly allowance for the same period, to the said tribes, of forty kegs of tobacco, and forty barrels of salt, to be delivered at the mouth of the loway river.
Article V. The United States, at the earnest request of the said confederated tribes, further agree to pay to Farnham and Davenport, Indian traders at Rock Island, the sum of forty thousand dollars without interest, which sum will be in full satisfaction of the claims of the said traders against the said tribes, and by the latter was, on the tenth day of July, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-one, acknowledged to be justly due, for articles of necessity, furnished in the course of the seven preceding years, in an instrument of writing of said date, duly signed by the Chiefs and Headmen of said tribes, and certified by the late Felix St. Vrain, United States' agent, and Antoine Le Claire, United States' Interpreter, both for the said tribes.

Annuity.
Blacksmith and gunsmith'a shop, &c.
Payment to Farnham & Davenport.

Art icl e VI. At the special request of the said confederated tribes, the United States agree to grant, by patent, in fee simple, to Antoine Le Claire, Interpreter, a part Indian, one section of land opposite Rock Island, and one section at the head of the first rapids above said Island, within the country herein ceded by the Sacs and Foxes.

Grant to A. Le Claire.

Article VII. Trusting to the good faith of the neutral bands of Sacs and Foxes, the United States have already delivered up to those bands the great mass of prisoners made in the course of the war by the United States, and promise to use their influence to procure the delivery of other Sacs and Foxes, who may still be prisoners in the hands of a band of Sioux Indians, the friends of the United States; but the following named prisoners of war, now in confinement, who were Chiefs and Headmen, shall be held as hostages for the future good conduct of the late hostile bands, during the pleasure of the President of the Unite# States, viz :--Muk-ka-ta-mish-a-ka-kaik (or Black Hawk) and his two sons; Wau-ba-kee-shik (the Prophet) his brother and two sons; Napope; We-sheet loway; Pamaho; and Cha-kee-pa-shi-pa-ho (the little stabbing Chief.)
Arti cle VIII. And it is further stipulated and agreed between the parties to this treaty, that there shall never be allowed in the confederated Sac and Fox nation, any separate band, or village, under any chief or warrior of the late hostile bands; but that the remnant of the said hostile bands shall be divided among the neutral bands of the said tribes according to blood--the Sacs among the Sacs, and the Foxes among the Foxes.
Arti cle IX. In consideration of the premises, peace and friendship are declared, and shall be perpetually maintained between the United States and the whole confederated Sac and Fox nation, excepting from the latter the hostages before mentioned.

Delivery of prisoners by the United States.
Hostages.
Hostile bands to be divided.
Peace and friendship.

Article X. The United States, besides the presents, delivered at the

Present for discovery of mines. Treaty binding when ratified.

signing of this treaty, wishing to give a striking evidence of their mercy and liberality, will immediately cause to be issued to the said confederated tribes, principally for the use of the Sac and Fox women and children, whose husbands, fathers and brothers, have been killed in the late war, and generally for the use of the whole confederated tribes, articles of subsistence as follows: -- thirty-five beef cattle; twelve bushels of salt; thirty barrels of pork; and fifty barrels of flour, and cause to be delivered for the same purposes, in the month of April next, at the mouth of the lower loway, six thousand bushels of maize or Indian corn.
Arti cle XI. At the request of the said confederated tribes, it is agreed that a suitable present shall be made to them on their pointing out to any United States agent, authorised for the purpose, the position or positions of one or more mines, supposed by the said tribes to be of a metal more valuable than lead or iron.
Arti cle XII. This treaty shall take effect and be obligatory on the contracting parties, as soon as the same shall be ratified by the President of the United States, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate thereof.

Done at Fort Armstrong, Rock Island, Illinois, this twenty-first day

The fourth article of the treaty to which this is a supplement, provides that each Chickasaw family, shall have a tract of land, reserved for the use of the family, to live on and occupy, so long as the nation resides in the country where they now are. And the fifth article of the treaty provides that each family or individual shall be paid for their improvements, and the value of their cleared lands, when the nation shall determine to remove and leave the said reserved tracts of land. It is now proposed and agreed to, that no family or person of the Chickasaw nation, who shall or may have tracts of land, reserved for their residence while here, shall ever be permitted to lease any of said land, to any person whatsoever, nor shall they be permitted to rent any of said land, to any person, either white, red, or black, or mixed blood of either. As the great object of the nation is to preserve the land, and timber, for the benefit of posterity, provided the nation shall continue to live here, and if they shall at any time determine to remove and sell the land, it will be more valuable, and will sell for more money, for the benefit of the nation, if the land and timber be preserved.
It is also expressly declared by the nation, that, whenever the nation shall determine to remove from their present country, that every tract of land so reserved in the nation, shall be given up and sold for the benefit of the nation. And no individual or family shall have any right to retain any of such reserved tracts of land, for their own use, any longer than the nation may remain in the country where they now are.
As the reserve tracts of land above alluded to, will be the first choice of land in the nation, it is determined that the minimum price of all the reserved tracts, shall be three dollars an acre, untill the nation may determine to reduce the price, and then they will notify the President, of their wishes, and the price to which they desire to reduce it.
The Chiefs still express fears that combinations may be formed at the public sales, where their reserved tracts of land shall be offered for sale, and that they may not be sold so high as they might be sold, by judi-
cious agents at private sale. They therefore suggest the propriety of the President determining on some judicious mode of selling the reserves at private sale.
It is therefore agreed that the suggestion be submitted to the President, and if he and the Chiefs can agree on a plan of a sale, different from the one proposed in the treaty, to which this is a supplement, and which shall be approved of by both parties, then they may enter into such agreement and the President shall then be governed by the same, in the sale of the reserved tracts of'land, whenever they may be offered
for sale. In the provisions of the fourth article of the treaty to which this is a
supplement, for reserves to young men who have no families, it expresses that each young man, who is twenty-one years of age, shall have a reserve. But as the Indians mature earlier than white men, and generally marry younger, it is determined to extend a reserve, to each young man who is seventeen years of age. And as there are some
(388)

orphan girls in the nation or whose families do not provide for them, and also some widows in the same situation,it is determined to allow to each of them a reservation of one section, on the same terms and conditions in all respects, with the other reservations for the nation generally, and to be allowed to the same ages, as to young men.
Colbert Moore and family have always lived in the Chickasaw nation,
and he requests the liberty to continue with the nation. The Chiefs and nation agree to his request, and they also agree to allow him and his family a reserve tract of land to live on and occupy in the same manner, and on the same terms and conditions as is provided for the Chickasaw families, in the nation generally, during his good behavior.
The Chiefs of the nation represent that they in behalf of the nation gave a bond to James Colbert for a debt due to him, of eighteen hundred and eleven dollars, ninety-three and three fourth cents principal, that James Colbert transferred said note to Robert Gordon and that said note, and the interest thereon is yet due and unpaid, and the said Robert Gordon has proposed to take a section of land for said note, and interest up to this date. It is therefore agreed by the nation to grant him a section of land, to be taken any where in the nation, so as not to interfere with any reserve which has been provided as a residence for the Chickasaws, which shall be in full for said note and interest.
The Treaty, to which this is a supplement provides that there shall be offices kept some where central in the nation, at such place as the President shall determine, for transacting the business of the nation in selling their lands &c. It is now agreed to by the nation, that the President may select a section of land, or four quarter sections adjoining, at such place as he may determine agreeably to that provision of the Treaty, to establish the said offices on, and for all the necessary
uses thereto attached, and he is permitted to improve the said tract of land in any manner, whatsoever, but when it shall cease to be used for the purposes, for which it is set apart--for offices &c.--then the same shall be sold under the direction of the President -- and the proceeds thereof shall be paid to the Chickasaw nation, after deducting there-
from the value of all the improvements on the land, which value shall be assessed by the President, and in no case shall it exceed one half the sale of the land.
The Chickasaw nation request the Government to grant them a cross mail route through the nation as follows, one to pass from Tuscumbia in Alabama, by the Agency, and by the place to be selected for the offices to be kept and to Rankin in Mississippi on horse back, once a week each way. The other to run from Memphis in Tennessee, by the offices .and to the Cotton Gin in Mississippi--to pass once a week each way. They conceive these mails would be useful to the nation, and indispensible to the carrying on the business of the nation when the offices are established, but they would respectfully solicit the mails to be started as soon as possible, to open the avenues of information into their country.
John Donley has long been known in this nation, as a mail carrier; he rode on the mails through our nation when a boy and for many years after he was grown; we think he understands that business as well, if not better than any other man--and we should prefer him to carry our mails to any other person--and if he is given the contract, the nation will set apart a section of land for his use while we remain here in this country, which section he may select with the advice of the Chiefs any where that suits him best, so as not to interfere with any of the reserves, and he may use it in any manner to live on, or make such improvements as may be necessary for keeping his horses, or to raise forage for them. But when the nation shall move away and leave this country
this tract of land must be sold for the benefit of the nation, in the same

manner that the reserve tracts are sold &c. and he is not to claim of the nation any pay for improving said tract of land.
[The lease which was given to William B. Lewis under the provisions of the treaty of the 19th October 1818 was altered and renewed in a treaty which was signed at Franklin in Tennessee in. August 1830 --at which time Robert P. Currin of Franklin had become a partner with William B. Lewis. In said treaty at Franklin the said Lewis & Currin (having failed to obtain salt) agreed to pay the nation a sum of money as therein expressed, for the use of the land during the term of the lease, and also a small quantity of salt, as is also expressed--a part of the money was then paid to the nation in hand, with their obligation to pay the whole balance by instalments. But Mr. Currin, who seems now to be the sole owner of that contract, says he cannot pay us, because the Government refuses to admit his title under the lease. Thus the nation is kept out of the money for the lease. Mr. Currin has addressed a line to Levi Colbert and James Brown, the agents for the Chickasaws, in that business, and also one to Genl. Coffee the United States Commissioner, asking them to place his claim in a situation that he may have the use of the land, or that the Government take the land, and pay him for it at the Government minimum price. The Chickasaw nation feel desirous to have the matter settled amicably, and they have no wish to violate their last contract--but as Robert P. Currin represents to the nation, that he is willing and desirous to settle it, by the nation ceding the land to the Government of the United States, upon the condition that they pay him for the land at the rate of one dollar and twenty-five cents an acre, to be paid in one year after the ratification of this treaty--We the Chickasaw nation do hereby cede the said
reserve tract of four- miles square, to the United States, on the following terms and conditions--they shall pay for the land one dollar and twentyfive cents an acre, three-fourths of the amount to be paid to Robert P. Currin, which shall be in full for all his right and claim to said lands-- and one-fourth to the Chickasaw nation, for their interest in changing the lease, to a final sale forever. If this agreement is not approved of by Mr. Currin and ratified by the President and Senate its rejection shall not affect the balance of this t*reaty.]

In witness of all and every thing herein determined between the United States and the whole Chickasaw nation, in general Council assembled, the parties have hereunto set their hands and seals at
the Council house, on Pontitock Creek, in the Chickasaw nation on this twenty-second day of October one thousand eight hundred
and thirty-two.

ARTICLES OF A TREATY

Made and entered into between Genl. John Coffee, being duly authorised thereto, by the President of the United States, and the whole Chickasaw Nation, in General Council assembled, at the Council House, on Pontitock Creek on the twentieth day of October, 1832.

Oct. 20, 1832. Proclamation, March 1, 1833.

The Chickasaw Nation find themselves oppressed in their present situation ; by being made subject to the laws of the States in which they reside. Being ignorant of the language and laws of the white man, they cannot understand or obey them. Rather than submit to this great
evil, they prefer to seek a home in the west, where they may live and be governed by their own laws. And believing that they can procure
for themselves a home, in a country suited to their wants and condition,

Preamble.

382

TREATY WITH THE CHICKASAWS. 1832.

Cession of lands to U. S.
Ceded lands to be surveyed, &c.
Compensation to Chickasaws.
Chickasaws to seek a home west of the Mississippi.
In case they fail to procure such a home.
Allotments.

provided they had the means to contract and pay for the same, they have determined to sell their country and hunt a new home. The President has heard the complaints of the Chickasaws, and like them believes they cannot be happy, and prosper as a nation, in their present situation and condition, and being desirous to relieve them from the great calamity that seems to await them, if they remain as they are -- He has sent his Commissioner Genl. John Coffee, who has met the whole Chickasaw nation in Council, and after mature deliberation, they have entered into the following articles, which shall be binding on both parties, when the same shall be ratified by the President of the United States by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.
Arti cle I. For the consideration hereinafter expressed, the Chickasaw nation do hereby cede, to the United States, all the land which they own on the east side of the Mississippi river, including all the country where they at present live and occupy.
Arti cle II. The United States agree to have the whole country thus ceded, 'surveyed, as soon as it can be conveniently done, in the same manner that the public lands of the United States are surveyed in the States of Mississippi and Alabama, and as soon thereafter as may be practicable, to have the same prepared for sale. The President of the United States will then offer the land for sale at public auction, in the same manner and on the same terms and conditions as the other public lands, and such of the land as may not sell at the public sales shall be offered at private sale, in the same manner that other private sales are made of the United States lands.
Art icl e HI. As a full compensation to the Chickasaw nation, for the country thus ceded, the United States agree to pay over to the Chickasaw nation, all the money arising from the sale of the land which may be received from time to time, after deducting therefrom the whole cost and expenses of surveying and selling the land, including every expense attending the same.
Article IV. The President being determined that the Chickasaw people shall not deprive themselves of a comfortable home, in the country where they now are, untill they shall have provided a country in the west to remove to, and settle on, with fair prospects of future comfort and happiness--It is therefore agreed to, by the Chickasaw nation, that they will endeavor as soon as it may be in their power, after the ratification of this treaty, to hunt out and procure a home for their people, west of the Mississippi river, suited to their wants and condition; and they will continue to do so during the progress of the survey of their present country, as is provided for in the second article of this treaty. But should they fail to procure such a country to remove to and settle on, previous to the first public sale of their country here then and in that event, they are to select out of the surveys, a comfortable settlement for every family in the Chickasaw nation, to include their present improvements, if the land is good for cultivation, and if not they may take it in any other place in the nation, which is unoccupied by any other person. Such settlement must be taken by sections. And there shall be allotted to each family as follows (to wit): To a single man who is twenty-one years of age, one section--to each family of five and under that number two sections--to each family of six and not exceeding ten, three sections, and to each family over ten in number, four sections--and to families who own slaves, there shall be allowed, one section to those who own ten or upwards and such as own under ten, there shall be allowed half a section. If any person shall now occupy two places and wish to retain both, they may do so, by taking a part at one place, and a part at the other, and where two or more persons are

TREATY WITH THE CHICKASAWS. 1832-

383

now living on the same section, the oldest occupant will be entitled to remain, and the others must move off to some other place if so required by the oldest occupant. All of which tracts of land, so selected and retained, shall be held, and occupied by the Chickasaw people, uninterrupted until they shall find and obtain a country suited to their wants and condition. And the United States will guaranty to the Chickasaw nation, the quiet possession and uninterrupted use of the said reserved tracts of land, so long as they may live on and occupy the same. And when they shall determine to remove from said tracts of land, the Chickasaw nation will notify the President of the United States of their determination to remove, and thereupon as soon as the Chickasaw people shall remove, the President will proclaim the said reserved tracts of land for sale at public auction and at private sale, on the same terms and conditions, as is provided for in the second article of this treaty, to sell the same, and the nett proceeds thereof, to be paid to the Chickasaw nation, as is provided for in the third article of this treaty.
Arti cle V. If any of the Chickasaw families shall have made valuable improvements on the places where they lived and removed from, on the reservation tracts, the same shall be valued by some discreet person to be appointed by the President, who shall assess the real cash value of all such improvements, and also the real cash value of all the land within their improvements, which they may have cleared and actually cultivated, at least one year in good farming order and condition. And such valuation of the improvements and the value of the cultivated lands as before mentioned, shall be paid to the person who shall have made the same. To be paid out of the proceeds of the sales of the ceded lands. The person who shall value such land and improvements, shall give to the owner thereof, a certificate of the valuation, which shall be a good voucher for them to draw the money on, from the proper person, who shall be appointed to pay the same, and the money shall be paid, as soon as may be convenient, after the valuation, to enable the owner thereof to provide for their families on their journey to their new homes. The provisions of this article are intended to encourage industry and to enable the Chickasaws to move comfortably. But least the good intended may be abused, by designing persons, by hiring hands and clearing more land, than they otherwise would do for the benefit of their families--It is determined that no payment shall be made for improved lands, over and above one-eighth part of the tract allowed and reserved for such person to live on and occupy.
Arti cle VI. The Chickasaw nation cannot receive any part of the payment for their land untill it shall be surveyed and sold; therefore, in order to the greater facility, in surveying and preparing the land for sale, and for keeping the business of the nation separate and apart from the business and accounts of the United States, it is proposed by the Chickasaws, and agreed to, that a Surveyor General be appointed by the President, to superintend alone the surveying of this ceded country or so much thereof as the President may direct, who shall appoint a sufficient number of deputy surveyors, as may be necessary to com-plete the survey, in as short a time as may be reasonable and expedient. That the said Surveyor General be allowed one good clerk, and one good draftsman to aid and assist him in the business of his office, in preparing the lands for sale. It is also agreed that one land office be established for the sale of the lands, to have one Register and one Receiver of monies, to be appointed by the President, and each Register and Receiver to have one good clerk to aid and assist them in the duties of their office. The Surveyor's office, and the office of the Register and Receiver of money, shall be kept somewhere central in the nation, at such place as the President of the United States may direct. As the

Guaranty by U. S. When Chickasaws determine to remove, they will give notice, &c. Improvements to be valued, &c.
Surveyor-general to be appointed, &c.

TREATY WITH THE CHICKASAWS. 1832.

Salaries of Surveyor-general, &c.
No pre-emption rights to be granted by U.S.
Combinations among purchasers to be prevented.
Reduction of price, &c.

before mentioned officers, and clerks, are to be employed entirely in business of the nation, appertaining to preparing and selling the land, they will of course be paid out of the proceeds of the sales of the ceded lands. That the Chickasaws, may now understand as near as may be, the expenses that will be incurred in the transacting of this business-- It is proposed and agreed to, that the salary of the Surveyor General be fifteen hundred dollars a year, and that the Register and Receiver of monies, be allowed twelve hundred dollars a year each, as a full compensation for their services, and all expenses, except stationary and postages on their official business, and that each of the clerks and draftsman be allowed seven hundred and fifty dollars a year, for their services and all e*xpenses.
Article VII. It is expressly agreed that the United States shall not grant any right of preference, to any person, or right of occupancy in any manner whatsoever, but in all cases, of either public or private sale, they are to sell the land to the highest bidder, and also that none of the lands be sold in smaller tracts than quarter sections or fractional sections of the same size as near as may be, untill the Chickasaw nation may require the President to sell in smaller tracts. The Chiefs of the nation have heard that at some of the sales of the United States lands, the people there present, entered into combinations, and united in purchasing much of the land, at reduced prices, for their own benefit, to the great prejudice of the Government, and they express fears, that attempts will be made to cheat them, in the same manner when their lands shall be offered at public auction. It is therefore agreed that the President will use his best endeavours, to prevent such combinations, or any other plan or state of things which may tend to prevent the land selling for its
full value.
Arti cle VIII. As the Chickasaws have determined to sell their country, it is desirable that the nation realize the greatest possible sum for their lands, which can be obtained. It is therefore proposed and agreed to that after the President shall have offered their lands for sale and shall have sold all that will sell for the Government price, then the price shall be reduced, so as to induce purchasers to buy, who would not take the land at the Government minimum price ;--and it is believed, that five years from and after the date of the first sale, will dispose of all the lands, that will sell at the Government price. If then at the expiration of five years, as before mentioned, the Chickasaw nation may request the President to sell at such reduced price as the nation may then propose, it shall be the duty of the President to comply with their request, by first offering it at public and afterwards at private sale, as in all other cases of selling public lands.

Agent to be continued among Chickasaws.

Arti cle IX. The Chickasaw nation express their ignorance, and incapacity to live, and be happy under the State laws, they cannot read and understand them, and therefore they will always need a friend to advise and direct them. And fearing at some day the Government of the United States may withdraw from them, the agent under whose instructions they have lived so long and happy--They therefore request that the agent may be continued with them, while here, and wherever they may remove to and settle. It is the earnest wish of the United States Government to see the Chickasaw nation prosper and be happy, and so far as is consistent they will contribute all in their power to render them so--therefore their request is granted. There shall be an agent kept with the Chickasaws as heretofore, so long as they live within

* This article was amended, previous to ratification, by the insertion, after " President," where that word occurs the first and third times, of the words, "by and with the advice and consent of the Senate."

TREATY WITH THE CHICKASAWS. 1832.

385

the jurisdiction of the United States as a nation, either within the limits of the States where they now reside, or at any other place. And whenever the office of agent shall be vacant, and an agent to be appointed, the President will pay due respect to the wishes of the nation in selecting a man in all respects qualified to discharge the responsible duties of that office.

Arti cle X. Whenever the Chickasaw nation shall determine to
remove from, and leave their present country, they will give the Presi-
dent of the United States timely notice of such intention, and the President will furnish them, the necessary funds, and means for their transportation and journey, and for one years provisions, after they reach
their new homes, in such quantity as the nation may require, and the full amount of such funds, transportation and provisions, is to be paid
for, out of the proceeds of the sales of the ceded lands. And should the
Chickasaw nation remove, from their present country, before they receive money, from the sale of the lands, hereby ceded; then and in that case, the United States shall furnish them any reasonable sum of money for national purposes, which may be deemed proper by the President of the
United States, which sum shall also be refunded out of the sales of the
ceded lands.

Art icl e XI. The Chickasaw nation have determined to create a

perpetual fund, for the use of the nation forever, out of the proceeds of

the country now ceded away. And for that purpose they propose to

invest a large proportion of the money arising from the sale of the land,

in some safe and valuable stocks, which will bring them in an annual

interest or dividend, to be used for all national purposes, leaving the

principal untouched, intending to use the interest alone. It is there-

fore proposed by the Chickasaws, and agreed to, that the sum to be laid

out in stocks as above mentioned, shall be left with the government of

the United States, untill it can be laid out under the direction of the

President of the United States, by and with the advice and consent of

the Senate, in such safe and valuable stock as he may approve of, for

the use and benefit of the Chickasaw nation. The sum thus to be in-

vested, shall be equal to, at least three-fourths of the whole nett proceeds

of the sales of the lands; and as much more, as the nation may deter-

mine, if there shall be a surplus after supplying all the national wants.

But it is hereby provided, that if the reasonable wants of the nation

shall require more than one fourth of the proceeds of the sales of the

land, then they may, by the consent of the President and Senate, draw

from the government such sum as may be thought reasonable, for valuable national purposes, out of the three-fourths reserved to be laid out

in stocks. But if any of the monies shall be thus drawn out of the sum

first proposed, to be laid out on interest, the sum shall be replaced, out

of the first monies of the nation, which may come into the possession

of the United States government, from the sale of the ceded lands, over

and above the reasonable wants of the nation. At the expiration of fifty

years from this date, if the Chickasaw nation shall have improved in

education and civilization, and become so enlightened, as to be capable

of managing so large a sum of money to advantage, and with safety, for

the benefit of the nation, and the President of the United States, with

the Senate, shall be satisfied thereof, at that time, and shall give their

consent thereto, the Chickasaw nation may then withdraw the whole,

or any part of the fund now set apart, to be laid out in stocks, or at

interest, and dispose of the same, in any manner that they may think

proper at that time, for the use and benefit of the whole nation; but no

part of said fund shall ever be used for any other purpose, than the

benefit of the whole Chickasaw nation. In order to facilitate the sur-

vey and sale of the lands now ceded, and to raise the money therefrom

TREATY WITH THE CHICKASAWS. 1832.

as soon as possible, for the foregoing purpose, the President of the
United States is authorised to commence the survey of the land as soon as may be practicable, after the ratification of this treaty.

Annuities to chiefs, &c.
Annuity to Queen Puccaun-la.

Article XII. The Chickasaws feel grateful to their old chiefs, for their long and faithful services, in attending to the business of the nation. They believe it a duty, to keep them from want in their old and declining age--with those feelings, they have looked upon their old and be loved chief Tish-o-mingo, who is now grown old, and is poor and not able to live, in that comfort, which his valuable life and great merit deserve. It is therefore determined to give him out of the national funds, one hundred dollars a year during the balance of his life, and the nation request him to receive it, as a token of their kind feelings for him, on account of his long and valuable services.
Our old and beloved Queen Puc-caun-la, is now very old and very poor. Justice says the nation ought not to let her suffer in her old age; it is therefore determined to give her out of the national funds, fifty dollars a year during her life, the money to be put in the hands of the agent to be laid out for her support, under his direction, with the advice of the chiefs.

Boundary line between Chickasaws and Choctaws.

Arti cle XIII. The boundary line between the lands of the Chickasaws and Choctaws, has never been run, or properly defined, and as the Choctaws have sold their country to the United States, they now have
no interest in the decision of that question. It is therefore agreed to
call on the old Choctaw chiefs to determine the line to be run, between the Chickasaws and their former country. The Chickasaws, by a treaty
made with the United States at Franklin in Tennessee, in Aug. 1830,(a) declared their line to run as follows, to wit: Beginning at the mouth of Oak tibby-haw and running up said stream to a point, being a marked
tree, on the old Natches road, one mile southwardly from Wall's old place. Thence with the Choctaw boundary, and along it, westwardly
through the Tunicha old fields, to a point on the Mississippi river, about
twenty-eight miles by water, below where the St. Francis river enters
said stream on the west side. It is now agreed, that the surveys of the Choctaw country which are now in progress, shall not cross the line
untill the true line shall be decided and determined; which shall be done as follows, the agent of the Choctaws on the west side of the Mississippi shall call on the old and intelligent chiefs of that nation, and lay before them the line as claimed by the Chickasaws at the Franklin treaty, and if the Choctaws shall determine that line to be correct, then it shall be established and made the permanent line, but if the Choc-
taws say the line strikes the Mississippi river higher up said stream, then the best evidence which can be had from both nations, shall be
taken by the agents of both nations, and submitted to the President of the United States for his decision, and on such evidence, the President
will determine the true line on principles of strict justice.

List of reservations.

Arti cle XIV. As soon as the surveys are made, it shall be the duty of the chiefs, with the advice and assistance of the agent to cause a correct list to be made out of all and every tract of land, which shall be reserved, for the use and benefit of the Chickasaw people, for their residence, as is provided for in the fourth article of this treaty, which list, will designate the sections of land, which are set apart for each family or individual in the nation, shewing the precise tracts which shall belong to each and every one of them, which list shall be returned to the register of the land office, and he shall make a record of the same, in his office, to prevent him from offering any of said tracts of land for sale, and also as evidence of each person's lands. All the residue of the lands will be offered by the President for sale.
(a) This treaty appears not to have been finally concluded.

Arti cle XV. The Chickasaws request that no persons be permitted to move in and settle on their country before the land is sold. It is
therefore agreed, that no person, whatsoever, who is not Chickasaw or connected with the Chickasaws by marriage, shall be permitted to come into the country and settle on any part of the ceded lands untill they shall be offered for sale, and then there shall not be any person permitted to settle on any of the land, which has not been sold, at the time of such settlement, and in all cases of a person settling on any of. the ceded lands contrary to this express understanding, they will be intruders, and must be treated as such, and put off of the lands of the nation.

No settlement in Chickasaw country till land is sold.

In witness of all and every thing herein determined, between the United States and the whole Chickasaw nation in general council assembled, the parties have hereunto set their hands and seals, at the council house, on Pontitock creek, in the Chickasaw nation, on this twentieth day of October, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-two.

TREATY WITH THE MENOMINEE NATION.
Where as articles of agreement between the United States of America, and the Menominee Indians, were made and concluded at the city of Washington, on the eighth day of February A. D. one thousand eight hundred and thirty-one, by John H. Eaton, and Samuel C. Stambaugh, Commissioners on the part of the United States, and certain Chiefs and Headmen of the Menominee Nation, on the part of said nation; to which articles, an addition or supplemental article was afterwards made, on the seventeenth day of Februry in the same year, by which the said Menominee Nation agree to cede to the United States certain parts of their land; and that a tract of country therein defined shall be set apart for the New York Indians. All which with the many other stipulations therein contained will more fully appear, by reference to the same. Which said agreements thus forming a Treaty, were laid before the Senate of the United States during their then session: but were not at said session acted on by that body. Whereupon a further agreement was on the fifteenth day of March, in the same year, entered into for the purpose of preserving the provisions of the treaty, made as aforesaid ; by which it was stipulated that the said articles of agreement, concluded as aforesaid, should be laid before the next Senate of the United States, at their ensuing session; and if sanctioned and confirmed by them, that each and every article thereof should be as binding and obligatory upon the parties respectively, as if they had been sanctioned at the previous session. And whereas the Senate of the United States, by their resolution of the twenty-fifth day of June, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-two, did advise and consent to accept, ratify and confirm the same, and every clause and article thereof upon the conditions expressed in the proviso, contained in their said resolution: which proviso is as follows : " Provided that for the purpose of establishing the rights of the New York Indians, on a permanent and just footing, the said treaty shall be ratified, with the express understanding that two townships of land on the east side of Winnebago Lake, equal to forty-six thousand and eighty acres shall be laid off (to commence at some point to be agreed on) for the use of the Stockbridge and Munsee tribes ; and that the improvements made on the lands now in the possession of the said

TREATY WITH THE MENOMONIEs. 1832.

tribes on the east side of the Fox river, which said lands are to be relinquished shall, after being valued by a commissioner to be appointed
by the President of the United States, be paid for by the Government: Provided, however, that the valuation of such improvements shall not
exceed the sum of twenty-five thousand dollars. And that there shall be one township of land adjoining the foregoing, equal to twenty-three
thousand and forty acres laid off and granted for the use of the Brothertown Indians, who are to be paid by the Government the sum of one
thousand six hundred dollars for the improvements on the lands now in
their possession, on the east side of Fox river, and which lands are to
be relinquished by said Indians: also that a new line shall be run, parallel to the southwestern boundary line or course of the tract of five
hundred thousand acres, described in the first article of this treaty, and
set apart for the New York Indians, to commence at a point on the west side of the Fox river, and one mile above the Grand Shute, on Fox river, and at a sufficient distance from the said boundary line as established by the said first article, as shall comprehend the additional quantity of two hundred thousand acres of land on and along the west side of Fox river, without including any of the confirmed private land claims on the Fox river; and which two hundred thousand acres shall be a part of the five hundred thousand acres, intended to be set apart for the Six Nations of the New York Indians and the St. Regis tribe;
and that an equal quantity to that which is added to the southwestern side shall be taken off from the northeastern side of the said tract
described in that'article, on the Oconto creek, to be determined by a commissioner to be appointed by the President of the United States;
so that the whole number of acres to be granted to the Six Nations, and
St. Regis tribe of Indians, shall not exceed the quantity originally stipulated by the treaty." And whereas, before the treaty aforesaid,
conditionally ratified, according to the proviso to the resolution of the Senate, above recited, could be obligatory upon the said Menominee
nation, their assent to the same must be had and obtained.
And whereas the honorable Lewis Cass, Secretary of the Department of War, by his letter of instructions of the eleventh day of September,
A. D. 1832, did authorize and request George B. Porter, Governor of the Territory of Michigan, to proceed to Green Bay, and endeavor to
procure the assent of the Menominees to the change proposed by the Senate, as above set forth; urging the necessity of directing his first efforts to an attempt to procure the unconditional assent of the Menominees to the said treaty, as ratified by the Senate. But should he fail in this object that he would then endeavor to procure their assent to the best practicable terms, short of those proposed by the Senate; giving them to understand that he merely received such proposition as they
might make, with a view to transmit it for the consideration of the
President and Senate of the United States. And if this course became
necessary that it would be very desirable that the New York Indians
should also signify their acceptance of the modifications required by the Menominees.
And whereas, in pursuance of the said instructions the said George B. Porter proceeded to Green Bay and having assembled all the chiefs
and headmen of the Menominee nation, in council, submitted to them, on the twenty-second day of October A. D. one thousand eight hundred
and thirty-two, the said proviso annexed to the resolution aforesaid of
the Senate of the United States, for the ratification of the said treaty:
and advised and urged on them the propriety of giving their assent to the same. And the said chiefs and headmen having taken time to de-
liberate and reflect bn the proposition so submitted to them, and which
they had been urged to assent to, did in the most positive and decided manner, refuse to give their assent to the same. (The many reasons

TREATY WITH THE MENOMONIES. 1832.

407

assigned for this determination, by them, being reported in the journal of
the said commissioner, which will be transmitted with this agreement.) And whereas after failing in the object last stated, the said George B.
Porter endeavored to procure the assent of the said chiefs and headmen
of the Menominee nation to the best practicable terms short of those proposed by the Senate of the United States; and after much labor and
pains, entreaty and persuasion, the said Menominees consented to the
following, as the modifications which they would make; and which are
reduced to writing, in the form of an agreement, as the best practicable terms which could be obtained from them, short of those proposed by the Senate of the United States, which they had previously positively refused to accede to. And as the modifications so made and desired,
have been acceded to by the New York Indians, with a request that the
treaty thus modified might be ratified and approved by the President and the Senate of the United States, it is the anxious desire of the
Menominees also, that the treaty, with these alterations may be ratified
and approved without delay, that they may receive the benefits and advantage secured to them by the several stipulations of the said treaty,
of which they have so long been deprived. The following is the article of agreement made between the said
George B. Porter, commissioner on the part of the United States, specially appointed as aforesaid, and the said Menominee nation, through
their chiefs and headmen on the part of their nation. First . The said chiefs and headmen of the Menominee nation of
Indians do not object to any of the matters contained in the proviso annexed to the resolution of the Senate of the United States, so far as
the same relate to the granting of three townships of land on the east side of Winnebago Lake, to the Stockbridge Munsee and Brothertown
tribes; to the valuation and payment for their improvements, &c. (ending with the words "and which lands are to be relinquished by said
Indians."} They therefore assent to the same. Seco nd . The said chiefs and headmen of the Menominee nation
of Indians, objecting to all the matters contained in the said proviso annexed to the resolution of the Senate of the United States, so far as
the same relate to the running of a new line parallel to the south-western boundary line or course of the tract of five hundred thousand acres, de-
scribed in the first article of the treaty, and set apart for the New York
Indians, to commence at a point on the southwestern side of Fox river, and one mile above the Grand Shute, on Fox river, and at a sufficient
distance from the said boundary line, as established by the said first article, as shall comprehend the additional quantity of two hundred thousand acres of land, on and along the west side of the Fox river, without including any of the confirmed private land claims, on the Fox river, to compose a part of the five hundred thousand acres intended to
be set apart for the Six Nations of the New York Indians and St. Regis tribe, agree in lieu of this proposition, to set off a like quantity of two
hundred thousand acres as follows: The said Menominee nation hereby agree to cede for the benefit of the New York Indians along the south-
western boundary line of the present five hundred thousand acres described in the first article of the treaty as set apart for the New York
Indians, a tract of land; bounded as follows. Beginning on the said
treaty line, at the old mill dam on Fox river, and thence extending up
along Fox river to the little Rapid Croclie; from thence running a northwest course three miles; thence on a line running parallel with the several courses of Fox river, and three miles distant from the river,
until it will intersect a line, running on a northwest course, commencing
at a point one mile above the Grand Shute; thence on a line running
northwest, so far as will be necessary to include, between the said last line and the line described as the southwestern boundary line of the

five hundred thousand acres in the treaty aforesaid, the quantity of two hundred thousand acres; and thence running northeast until it will intersect the line, forming the southwestern boundary line aforesaid; and from thence along the said line to the old mill dam, or place of beginning, containing two hundred thousand acres. Excepting and reserving therefrom the privilege of Charles A. Grignon, for erecting a mill on Apple creek, &c. as approved by the Department of War on the twentysecond day of April one thousand eight hundred and thirty-one and all confirmed private land claims on the Fox river. The lines of the said tract of land so granted to be run, marked and laid off without delay, by a commissioner to be appointed by the President of the United States. And that in exchange for the above, a quantity of land equal to that which is added to the southwestern side shall be taken off from the northeastern side of the said tract, described in that article, on the Oconto creek, to be run, marked and determined by the commissioner to be appointed by the President of the United States, as aforesaid, so that the whole number of acres to be granted to the Six Nations and St. Regis tribe of Indians, shall not exceed the quantity of five hundred thousand acres.
Thi rd . The said chiefs and headmen of the Menominee nation agree, that in case the said original treaty, made as aforesaid, and the supplemental articles thereto, be ratified and confirmed at the ensuing session of the Senate of the United States, with the modifications contained in this agreement, that each and every article thereof shall be as binding and obligatory upon the parties respectively, as if they had been sanctioned at the times originally agreed upon.
In consideration of the above voluntary sacrifices of their interest, made by the said Menominee nation, and as evidence of the good feeling of their great father, the President of the United States, the said George B. Porter commissioner as aforesaid, has delivered to the said chiefs, headmen, and the people of the said Menominee nation here assembled, presents in clothing to the amount of one thousand dollars:
five hundred bushels of corn, ten barrels of pork, and ten barrels of
flour, &c. &c.

APPENDIX.
To all to whom these, presents shall come, the undersigned, Chiefs and Headmen of the sundry tribes of New York Indians, (as set forth in the specifications annexed to their signaturessend greeting:
Whereas a tedious, perplexing and harassing dispute and controversy have long existed between the Menominee nation of Indians and the New York Indians, more particularly known as the Stockbridge, Munsee and Brothertown tribes, the Six Nations and St. Regis tribe. The treaty made between the said Menominee nation, and the United States, and the conditional ratification thereof by the Senate of the United States, being stated and set forth in the within agreement, entered into between the chiefs and headmen of the said Menominees, and George B. Porter, Governor of Michigan, commissioner specially appointed, with instructions referred to in the said agreement. And whereas the undersigned are satisfied, and believe that the best efforts of the said commissioner were directed and used to procure, if practicable, the unconditional assent of the said Menominees to the change proposed by the Senate of the United States in the ratification of the said treaty: but without success. And whereas the undersigned further believe that the terms stated in the within agreement are the best practicable terms, short of those proposed by the Senate of the United States, which could be obtained from the said Menominees; and being asked to signify our acceptance of the modifications proposed as aforesaid by the Menominees, we are compelled, by a sense of duty and propriety to say that we do hereby accept of the same. So far as the tribes to which we belong are concerned, we are perfectly satisfied, that the treaty should be ratified on the terms proposed by the Menominees. We further believe that the tract of land which the Menominees in the within agreement, are willing to cede, in exchange for an equal quantity on the northeast side of the tract of five hundred thousand acres, contains a sufficient quantity of good land, favorably and advantageously situated, to answer all the wants of the New York Indians, and St. Regis tribe. For the purpose, then, of putting an end to strife, and that we may all sit down in peace and harmony, we thus signify our acceptance of the modifications proposed by the Menominees: and we most respectfully request that the treaty as now modified by the agreement this day entered into with the Menominees, may be ratified and approved by the President and Senate of the United States.

Oct. 27, 1832.
Acceptance, on the part of the tribes interested, of the modifications proposed by the Menomonies.

In witness whereof, we have hereunto set our hands and seals, at the Agency House at Green Bay, this twenty-seventh day of October,

Between the United States of America and the Republic of Chile.
In the name of God, Author and Legislator of the Universe. The United States of America, and the republic of Chile, desiring to make firm and lasting the friendship and good understanding which happily prevails between both nations, have resolved to fix, in a manner clear, distinct, and positive, the rules which shall in future be religiously observed between the one and the other, by means of a treaty or general convention of peace and friendship, commerce and navigation. For this most desirable object, the President of the United States of America, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate thereof, has appointed, and conferred full powers on John Hamm, a citizen of said States, and their Charge d'Affaires near the said republic; and his excellency the President of the republic of Chile has appointed Senor Don Andres Bello, a citizen of the said republic. And the said plenipotentiaries, after having mutually produced and exchanged copies of their full powers, in due and proper form, have agreed upon and concluded the following articles, videlicet: Ar tic le I. There shall be a perfect, firm, and inviolable peace and sincere friendship between the United States of America and the republic of Chile, in all the extent of their possessions and territories, and between their people and citizens respectively, without distinction of persons or places. Arti cle II. The United States of America and the republic of Chile, desiring to live in peace and harmony with all the other nations of the earth, by means of a policy frank and equally friendly with all, engage mutually, not to grant any particular favor to other nations in respect of commerce and navigation, which shall not, immediately, become common to the other party, who shall enjoy the same freely, if the concession was freely made, or on allowing the same compensation, if the concession was conditional. It is understood, however, that the relations and convention which now exist, or may hereafter exist, between the republic of Chile and the republic of Bolivia, the federation of the Centre of America, the republic of Columbia, the United States of Mexico, the republic of Peru, or the United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata, shall form exceptions to this article. Arti cle III. The citizens of the United States of America may frequent all the coasts and countries of the republic of Chile, and reside and trade there, in all sorts of produce, manufactures, and merchandize, and shall pay no other or greater duties, charges, or fees, whatsoever, than the most favoured nation is or shall be obliged to pay; and they shall enjoy all the rights, privileges, and exemptions in navigation and commerce, which the most favored nation does or shall enjoy, submitting themselves, nevertheless, to the laws, decrees, and usages there established, and to which are submitted the citizens and subjects of the most favored nations. In like manner the citizens of the republic of Chile may frequent all the coasts and countries of the United States of America, and reside

435

and trade there, in all sorts of produce, manufactures, and merchandise, and shall pay no other or greater duties, charges or fees, whatsoever, than the most favored nation is or shall be obliged to pay, and they shall enjoy all the rights, privileges, and exemptions in commerce and navigation, which the most favored nation does or shall enjoy, submitting themselves, nevertheless, to the laws, decrees, and usages, there established, and to which are submitted the citizens and subjects of the most favored nations. But it is understood, that this article does not include the coasting trade of either country, the regulation of which is reserved by the parties, respectively, according to their own separate laws.

Coasting trade excepted.

Ar tic le IV. It is likewise agreed that it shall be wholly free for all merchants, commanders of ships, and other citizens of both countries, to manage, themselves, their own business, in all ports and places subject to the jurisdiction of each other, as well with respect to the consignment and sale of their goods and merchandise, by wholesale and retail, as with respect to the loading, unloading, and sending off their ships, they being in all these cases to be treated as citizens of the country in which they reside, or at least to be placed on a footing with the citizens or subjects- of the most favored nation.

Merchants and others free to manage their own business.

Arti cle V. The citizens of neither of the contracting parties shall be liable to any embargo, nor be detained with their vessels, cargoes, merchandise, or effects, for any military expedition, nor for any public or private purpose whatever, without allowing to those interested a sufficient indemnification.

Indemnification for embargo or detention.

Arti cle VI. Whenever the citizens of either of the contracting parties shall be forced to seek refuge or asylum in the rivers, bays, ports, or dominions of the other, with their vessels, whether of merchant or of war, public or private, through stress of weather, pursuit of pirates, or enemies, they shall be received and treated with humanity, giving to them all favor and protection for repairing their ships, procuring provisions, and placing themselves in a situation to continue their voyage without obstacle or hindrance of any kind.

Asylum secured.

Arti cle VII. All the ships, merchandise and effects belonging to the citizens of one of the contracting parties, which may be captured by pirates, whether within the limits of its jurisdiction or on the high seas, and may be carried or found in the rivers, roads, bays, ports, or dominions of the other, shall be delivered up to the owners, they proving in due and proper form their rights before the competent tribunals; it being well understood, that the claim should be made within the term of one year by the parties themselves, their attorneys, or agents of their respective Governments.

Vessels, &c. captured by pirates, to be restored.

Arti cle VIII. When any vessel belonging to the citizens of either of the contracting parties shall be wrecked, foundered, or suffer any damage on the coasts, or within the dominions of the other, there shall be given to them all assistance and protection in the same manner which is usual and customary with the vessels of the nation where the damage happens, permitting them to unload the said vessel, if necessary, of its merchandise and effects, without exacting for it any duty, impost, or contribution whatever, until they may be exported, unless they be destined for consumption in the country.

Protection in case of wreck.

Arti cle IX. The citizens of each of the contracting parties shall have power to dispose of their personal goods within the jurisdiction of the other, by sale, donation, testament, or otherwise, and their representatives, being citizens of the other party, shall succeed to their said personal goods, whether by testament or ab intestato, and they may take possession thereof, either by themselves or others acting for them, and

Protection to residents.

dispose of the same at their will, paying such dues only as the inhabitants of the country, wherein the said goods are, shall be subject to pay in like cases: and if, in the case of real estate, the said heirs would be prevented from entering into the possession of the inheritance, on account of their character of aliens, there shall be granted to them the term of three years to dispose of the same, as they may think proper, and to withdraw the proceeds without molestation, and exempt from any other charges than those which may be imposed by the laws of the country.
Art icl e X. Both the contracting parties promise and engage formally to give their special protection to the persons and property of the citizens of each other, of all occupations, who may be in the territories subject to the jurisdiction of the one or the other, transient or dwelling therein, leaving open and free to them the tribunals of justice for their judicial recourse on the same terms which are usual and customary, with the natives or citizens of the country in which they may be: for which they may employ in defence of their rights such advocates, solicitors, notaries, agents, and factors, as they may judge proper, in all their trials at law; and such citizens or agents shall have free opportunity to be present at the decisions and sentences of the tribunals, in all cases which may concern them, and likewise at the taking of all examinations and evidence which may be exhibited in the said trials.

Security of conscience, &c.

Arti cle XI. It is likewise agreed that the most perfect and entire security of conscience shall be enjoyed by the citizens of both the contracting parties in the countries subject to the jurisdiction of the one and the other, without their being liable to be disturbed or molested on account of their religious belief, so long as they respect the laws and established usages of the country. Moreover, the bodies of the citizens of one of the contracting parties, who may die in the territories of the other, shall be buried in the usual burying grounds, or in other decent or suitable places, and shall be protected from violation or disturbance.

Free ships to make free goods.
Proviso.

Art icl e XII. It shall be lawful for the citizens of the United States of America and of the republic of Chile to sail with their ships, with all manner of liberty and security, no distinction being made, who are the proprietors of the merchandise laden thereon, from any port to the places of those who now are or hereafter shall be at enmity with either of the contracting parties. It shall likewise be lawful for the citizens aforesaid to sail with the ships and merchandise before mentioned, and to trade with the same liberty and security from the places, ports, and havens, of those who are enemies of both or either party, without any opposition or disturbance whatsoever, not only directly from the places of the enemy, before mentioned, to neutral places, but also, from one place belonging to an enemy, to another place belonging to an enemy, whether they be under the jurisdiction of the one power, or under several. And it is hereby stipulated, that free ships shall also give freedom to goods, and that every thing shall be deemed to be free and exempt, which shall be found on board the ships belonging to the citizens of either of the contracting parties, although the whole lading, or any part thereof,'should appertain to the enemies of either, contraband goods being always excepted. It is also agreed, in like manner, that the same liberty be extended to persons who are on board a free ship, with this effect, that although they be enemies to both or either, they are not to be taken out of that free ship unless they are officers or soldiers, and in the actual service of the enemies: Provided, however, and it is hereby agreed, that the stipulations in this article contained, declaring that the flag shall cover the property, shall be understood as applying to those powers only who recognise the principle; but if either

CONVENTION WITH CHILE. 1832.

437

of the two contracting parties should be at war with a third, and the other neutral, the flag of the neutral shall cover the property of enemies whose governments acknowledge this principle, and not of others.

Arti cle XIII. It is likewise agreed, that in the case where the neutral flag of one of the contracting parties shall protect the property of the enemies of the other, by virtue of the above stipulation, it shall always be understood that the neutral property found on board such enemy's vessels shall be held and considered as enemy's property, and as such shall be liable to detention and confiscation, except such property as was put on board such vessel before the declaration of war, or even afterwards, if it were done without the knowledge of it; but the contracting parties agree, that, four months having elapsed after the declaration, their citizens shall not plead ignorance thereof. On the contrary, if the flag of the neutral does not protect the enemy's property, in that case, the goods and merchandise of the neutral, embarked in such enemy's ship, shall be free.
Ar tic le XIV. This liberty of commerce and navigation shall extend to all kinds of merchandises, excepting those only which are distinguished by the name of contraband, and under this name of contraband, or prohibited goods, shall be comprehended--
1st. Cannons, mortars, howitzers, swivels, blunderbusses, muskets, fuzees, rifles, carbines, pistols, pikes, swords, sabres, lances, spears, halberds, and grenades, bombs, powder, matches, balls, and all other things belonging to the use of these arms;
2d. Bucklers, helmets, breast-plates, coats of mail, infantry belts, and clothes made up in the form and for a military use.
3d. Cavalry belts, and horses with their furniture. 4th. And generally all kinds of arms and instruments of iron, steel, brass, and copper, or of any other materials manufactured, prepared and formed, expressly, to make war by sea or land.

Neutral property on board enemy's vessels liable to condemnation. Exception.
Contraband articles.

Ar tic le XV. All other merchandise and things not comprehended in the articles of contraband explicitly enumerated and classified as above, shall be held and considered as free, and subjects of free and lawful commerce, so that they may be carried and transported in the freest manner by both the contracting parties, even to places belonging to an enemy, excepting only those places which are at that time besieged or blockaded; and, to avoid all doubt in this particular, it is declared that those places only are besieged or blockaded, which are actually attacked by a belligerent force capable of preventing the entry of the neutral.
Arti cle XVI. The articles of contraband, before enumerated and classified which may be found in a vessel bound for an enemy's port, shall be subject to detention and confiscation, leaving free the rest of the cargo and the ship, that the owners may dispose of them as they see proper. No vessel of either of the two nations shall be detained on the high seas on account of having on board articles of contraband, whenever the master, captain, or supercargo of said vessel will deliver up the articles of contraband to the captor, unless the quantity of such articles be so great, and of so large a bulk, that they cannot be received on board the capturing ship without great inconvenience; but in this and in all other cases of just detention, the vessel detained shall be sent to the nearest convenient and safe port, for trial and judgment according to law.

All other articles free, except to blockaded ports.
Contraband articles not to condemn those not so.

Arti cle XVII. And whereas it frequently happens that vessels sail Notice of for a port or place belonging to an enemy, without knowing that the blockade. same is besieged, blockaded, or invested, it is agreed, that every vessel
2 m2

438

CONVENTION WITH CHILE. 1832.

so circumstanced, may be turned away from such port or place, but shall not be detained, nor shall any part of her cargo, if not contraband, be confiscated, unless, after warning of such blockade or investment from any officer commanding a vessel of the blockading forces, she shall again attempt to enter; but she shall be permitted to go to any other port or place she shall think proper. Nor shall any vessel of either, that may have entered into such port before the same was actually besieged, blockaded, or invested, by the other, be restrained from quitting such place with her cargo, nor if found therein after the reduction and surrender, shall such vessel or her cargo be liable to confiscation, but they shall be restored to the owners thereof; and if any vessel having thus entered the port before the blockade took place, shall take on board a cargo after the blockade be established, she shall be subject to be warned by the blockading forces, to return to the port blockaded, and discharge the said cargo; and, if after receiving the said warning, the vessel shall persist in going out with the cargo, she shall be liable to the same consequences as a vessel attempting to enter a blockaded port, after being warned off by the blockading forces.

Regulation of visits at sea.
Sea letters or passports in case of war.
Vessels under convoy.

Arti cle XVIII. In order to prevent all kinds of disorder in the visiting and examination of the ships and cargoes of both the contracting parties on the high seas, they have agreed, mutually, that whenever a vessel of war, public or private, shall meet with a neutral of the other contracting party, the first shall remain at the greatest distance compatible with making the visit, under the circumstances of the sea and wind, and the degree of suspicion attending the vessel to be visited, and shall send its smallest boat in order to execute the said examination of the papers concerning the ownership and cargo of the vessel, without causing the least extortion, violence, or ill-treatment, for which the commanders of the said armed ships shall be responsible with their persons and property; for which purpose the commanders of the said private armed vessels shall, before receiving their commissions, give sufficient security to answer for all damages they may commit. And it is expressly agreed, that the neutral party shall, in no case, be required to go on board the examining vessel, for the purpose of exhibiting her papers, or for any other purpose whatever.
Art icl e XIX. To avoid all kinds of vexation and abuse in the examination of the papers relating to the ownership of the vessels belonging to the citizens of the two contracting parties, they have agreed, and do agree, that, in case one of them shall be engaged in war, the ships and vessels belonging to the citizens of the other must be furnished with sea letters or passports, expressing the name, property and bulk of the ship, as also the name and place of habitation of the master or commander of said vessel, in order that it may thereby appear, that the ship really and truly belongs to the citizens of one of the parties; they have likewise agreed that, such ships, being laden, besides the sea-letters or passports, shall also be provided with certificates containing the several particulars of the cargo, and the place whence the ship sailed, so that it may be known whether any forbidden or contraband goods be on board the same; which certificates shall be made out by the officers of the place whence the ship sailed, in the accustomed form; without which requisites, said vessel may be detained, to be adjudged by the competent tribunal, and may be declared legal prize, unless the said defect shall be proved to be owing to accident, and be satisfied or supplied by testimony entirely equivalent.
Art icl e XX. It is further agreed, that the stipulations above expressed, relative to the visiting and examination of vessels, shall apply only to those which sail without convoy; and when said vessels shall be

CONVENTION WITH CHILE. 1832.

439

under convoy, the verbal declaration of the commander of the convoy, on his word of honor, that the vessels under his protection belong to the nation whose flag he carries; and when they are bound to an enemy's port, that they have no contraband goods on board, shall be sufficient.
Arti cle XXI. It is further agreed that, in all cases the established courts for prize causes, in the country to which the prizes may be conducted, shall alone take cognizance of them. And whenever such tribunal of either party shall pronounce judgment against any vessel or goods, or property claimed by the citizens of the other party, the sentence or decree shall mention the reasons or motives on which the same shall have been founded, and an authenticated copy of the sentence or decree, and of all the proceedings in the case, shall, if demanded, be delivered to the commandant or agent of said vessel, without any delay, he paying the legal fees for the same.

Prize courts.

Arti cle XXII. Whenever one of the contracting parties shall be engaged in war with another state, no citizen of the other contracting party shall accept a commission, or letter of marque, for the purpose of assisting or co-operating hostilely, with the said enemy, against the said party so at war, under the pain of being treated as a pirate.

No citizen of either party to enter the service of an enemy of the other.

Ar tic le XXIII. If, by any fatality which cannot be expected, and which God forbid, the two contracting parties should be engaged in a war with each other, they have agreed, and do agree, now for then, that there shall be allowed the term of six months to the merchants residing on the coasts and in the ports of each other, and the term of one year to those who dwell in the interior, to arrange their business and transport their effects wherever they please, giving to them the safe conduct necessary for it, which may serve as a sufficient protection until they arrive at the designated port. The citizens of all other occupations who may be established in the territories or dominions of the United States of America, and of the republic of Chile, shall be respected and maintained in the full enjoyment of their personal liberty and property, unless their particular conduct shall cause them to forfeit this protection, which, in consideration of humanity, the contracting parties engage to give them.

Tn case of war between the parties.

Arti cle XXIV. Neither the debts due from the individuals of the one nation, to the individuals of the other, nor shares, nor money which they may have in public funds, nor in public or private banks, shall ever, in any event of war, or of national difference, be sequestrated or confiscated.

Private and public debts sacred.

Ar tic le XXV. Both the contracting parties being desirous of avoiding all inequality in relation to their public communications, and official intercourse, have agreed, and do agree, to grant to their envoys, ministers, and other public agents, the same favors, immunities, and exemptions which those of the most favored nation do, or shall enjoy; it being understood that whatever favors, immunities, or privileges the United States of America or the republic of Chile may find it proper to give to the ministers and public agents of any other power, shall, by the same act, be extended to those of each of the contracting parties.

Public agents on the footing of those of the most favored nation.

Arti cle XXVI. To make more effectual the protection which the United States of America and the republic of Chile shall afford in future to the navigation and commerce of the citizens of each other, they agree to receive and admit consuls and vice consuls in all the ports open to foreign commerce, who shall enjoy in them all the rights, prerogatives, and immunities, of the consuls and vice consuls of the most favored nations; each contracting party, however, remaining at

Consuls, &c. to be admitted.

May require the aid of the civil authorities to arrest deserters.
Deserters must be sent back within two months.

liberty to except those ports and places in which the admission and residence of such consuls may not seem convenient.
Arti cle XXVII. In order that the consuls and vice consuls of the two contracting parties may enjoy the rights, prerogatives, and immunities, which belong to them, by their public character, they shall, before entering on the exercise of their functions, exhibit their commission or patent, in due form, to the Government to which they are accredited; and, having obtained their exequatur, they shall be held and considered as such, by all the authorities, magistrates and inhabitants, in the consular district in which they reside.
Arti cle XXVIII. It is likewise agreed, that the consuls, their secretaries, officers, and persons attached to the service of consuls, they not being citizens of the country in which the consul resides, shall be exempt from all public service, and, also, from all kinds of taxes, imposts, and contributions, except those which they shall be obliged to pay on account of commerce, or their property, to which the citizens and inhabitants, native and foreign, of the country in which they reside are subject; being in every thing besides subject to the laws of their respective states. The archives and papers of the consulate shall be respected inviolably; and, under no pretext whatever, shall any magistrate seize, or in any way interfere with them.
Art icl e XXIX. The said consuls shall have power to require the assistance of the authorities of the country for the arrest, detention, and custody of deserters from the public and private vessels of their country; and, for that purpose they shall address themselves to the courts, judges, and officers competent, and shall demand the said deserters in writing, proving by an exhibition of the registers of the vessel or ship's roll, or other public documents, that those men were part of said crews; and, on this demand, so proved, (saving, however, where the contrary is proved) the delivery shall not be refused. Such deserters, when arrested, shall be put at the disposal of said consuls, and may be put in the public prison at the request and expence of those who reclaim them, to be sent to the ships to which they belonged, or to others of the same nation. But if they be not sent back within two months, reckoning from the day of their arrest, they shall be set at liberty, and shall no more be arrested for the same cause. It is understood, however, that if the deserter should be found to have committed any crime or offence, his surrender may be delayed until the tribunal before which the case may be depending, shall have pronounced its sentence, and such sentence shall have been carried into effect.

Consular convention to be formed.

Arti cle XXX. For the purpose of more effectually protecting their commerce and navigation, the two contracting parties do hereby agree, as soon hereafter as circumstances will permit them, to form a consular convention, which shall declare, specially, the powers and immunities of the consuls and vice consuls of the respective parties.

Treaty to remain in force twelve years.

Art icl e XXXI. The United States of America and the Republic of Chile, desiring to make, as durable as circumstances will permit, the relations which are to be established between the two parties, by virtue of this treaty, or general convention of peace, amity, commerce, and navigation, have declared solemnly, and do agree to the following points:

CONVENTION WITH CHILE. 1832.

441

2d. If any one or more of the citizens of either party shall infringe any of the articles of this treaty, such citizen shall be held personally responsible for the same, and the harmony and good correspondence between the nations shall not be interrupted thereby; each party engaging in no way to protect the offender, or sanction such violation.
3d. If, (which, indeed, cannot be expected,) unfortunately, any of the articles contained in the present treaty shall be violated or infringed in any other way whatever, it is expressly stipulated that neither of the contracting parties will order or authorize any acts of reprisal, nor declare war against the other, on complaints of injuries or damages, until the said party, considering itself offended, shall first have presented to the other a statement of such injuries or damages, verified by competent proof, and demanded justice and satisfaction, and the same shall have been either refused or unreasonably delayed.
4th. Nothing in this treaty contained shall, however, be construed to operate contrary to former and existing public treaties with other sovereigns or States.
The present treaty of peace, amity, commerce and navigation, shall be approved and ratified by the President of the United States of America, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate thereof, and by the President of the Republic of Chile, with the consent and approbation of the Congress of the same; and the ratifications shall be exchanged in the City of Washington within nine months, to be reckoned from the date of the signature hereof, or sooner if practicable.

Done and concluded, in triplicate, in the city of Santiago, this sixteenth day of the month of May--in the year of our Lord Jesus Christ one thousand eight hundred and thirty-two; and in the fiftysixth year of the independence of the United States of America, and the twenty-third of that of the Republic of Chile.

The Consuls, Vice Consuls, and commercial Agents, shall have the right, as such, to sit as judges and arbitrators in such differences as may arise between the captains and crews of the vessels belonging to the nation whose interests are committed to their charge, without the interference of the local authorities, unless the conduct of the crews, or of the captain, should disturb the order or the tranquillity of the country, or the said Consuls, Vice Consuls, or Commercial Agents should require their assistance to cause their decisions to be carried into effect or supported.

PROCLAMATION

BY ANDREW JACKSON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. Dec. 10, 1832.

Whe re as a convention assembled in the State of South Carolina, have passed an ordinance, by which they declare, " That the several acts and parts of acts of the Congress of the United States, purporting to be laws for the imposing offduties and imposts on the importation of foreign commodities, and now having actual operation and effect within the United States, and more especially," two acts for the same purposes, passed on the 19th of May, 1828, and on the 14th of July, 1832, "are unauthorized by the Constitution of the United States, and violate the true meaning and intent thereof, and are null and void, and no law," nor binding on the citizens of that State, or its officers; and by the said ordinance, it is further declared to be unlawful for any of the constituted authorities of the State, or of the United States, to enforce the payment of the duties imposed by the said acts, within the same State, and that it is the duty of the legislature to pass such laws as may be necessary to give full effect to the said ordinance:
And whereas, by the said ordinance, it is further ordained, that, in no case of law or equity decided in the courts of said State, wherein shall be drawn in question the validity of the said ordinance, or of the acts of the legislature that may be passed to give it effect, or of the said laws of the United States, no appeal shall be allowed to the Supreme Court of the United States, nor shall any copy of the record be permitted or allowed for that purpose, and that any person attempting to take such appeal shall be punished as for contempt of court:
And, finally, the said ordinance declares that the people of South Carolina will maintain the said ordinance at every hazard; and that they will consider the passage of any act, by Congress, abolishing or closing the ports of the said State, or otherwise obstructing the free ingress or egress of vessels to and from the said ports, or any other act of the Federal Government to coerce the State, shut up her ports, destroy or harass her commerce, or to. enforce the said acts otherwise than through the civil tribunals of the country, as inconsistent with the longer continuance of South Carolina in the Union; and that the people of the said State will thenceforth hold themselves absolved from all further obligation to maintain or preserve their political connection with the people of the other States, and will forthwith proceed to organize a separate government, and do all other acts and things which sovereign and independent States may of right do :
And whereas the said ordinance prescribes to the people of South Carolina a course of conduct in direct violation of their duty as citizens of the United

States, contrary to the laws of their country, subversive of its constitution, and having for its object the destruction of the Union--that Union, which, coeval with our political existence, led our fathers, without any other ties to unite them than those of patriotism and a common cause, through a sanguinary struggle to a glorious independence,--thatsacred Union hitherto inviolate, which, perfected by our happy Constitution, has brought us, by the favor of Heaven, to a state of prosperity at home, and high consideration abroad, rarely, if ever, equalled in the history of nations,--To preserve this bond of our political existence from destruction, to maintain inviolate this state of national honor and prosperity, and to justify the confidence my fellow-citizens have reposed in me, I, ANDREW JACKSON, President of the United States, have thought proper to issue this my proclamation, stating my views of the Constitution and laws applicable to the measures adopted by the convention of South Carolina, and to the reasons they have put forth to sustain them, declaring the course which duty will require me to pursue, and, appealing to the understanding and patriotism of the people, warn them of the consequences that must inevitably result from an observance of the dictates of the convention.
Strict duty would require of me nothing more than the exercise of those powers with which I am now, or may hereafter be invested, for preserving the peace of the Union, and for the execution of the laws. But the imposing aspect which opposition has assumed in this case, by clothing itself with State authority, and the deep interest which the people of the United States must all feel in preventing a resort to stronger measures while there is a hope that any thing will be yielded to reasoning and remonstrance, perhaps demand, and will certainly justify a full exposition to South Carolina and the nation, of the views I entertain of this important question, as well as a distinct enunciation of the course which my sense of duty will require me to pursue.
The ordinance is founded, not on the indefeasible right of resisting acts which are plainly unconstitutional, and too oppressive to be endured ; but on the strange position that any one State may not only declare an act of Congress void, but prohibit its execution--that they may do this consistently with the Constitution -- that the true construction of that instrument permits a State to retain its place in the Union, and yet be bound by no other of its laws than those it may choose to consider as constitutional. It is true, they add, that to justify this abrogation of a law, it must be palpably contrary to the Constitution; but it is evident, that to give the right of resisting laws of that description, coupled with the uncontrolled right to decide what laws deserve that character, is to give the power of resisting all laws. For, as by the theory, there is no appeal, the reasons alleged by the State, good or bad, must prevail. If it should be said that public opinion is a sufficient check against the abuse of this power, it may be asked why it is not deemed a sufficient guard against the passage of an unconstitutional act by Congress ? There is, however, a restraint in this last case, which makes the assumed power of a State more indefensible, and which does not exist in the other. There are two appeals from an unconstitutional act passed by Congress--one to the Judiciary, the other to the People, and the States. There is no appeal from the State decision in theory, and the practical illustration shows that the courts are closed against an application to review it, both judges and jurors being sworn to decide in its favor. But reasoning on this subject is superfluous, when our social compact, in express terms declares, that the laws of the United States, its Constitution, and treaties made under it, are the supreme law of the land--and, for greater caution, adds " that the judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any thing in the Constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding." And it may be asserted without fear of refutation, that no Federative Government could exist without a similar provision. Look for a moment to the consequence. If South Carolina considers the revenue laws unconstitutional, and has a right to prevent their execution in the port of Charleston, there would be a clear constitutional objection to their collection in every other port, and no revenue could be collected any where; for all imposts must be equal. It is no answer to repeat, that an unconstitutional law is no law, so long as the question of its legality is to be .decided by the State itself; for every law operating injuriously upon any local interest, will be perhaps thought, and certainly represented, as unconstitutional, and, as has been shown, there is no appeal.
If this doctrine had been established at an earlier day, the Union would have been dissolved in its infancy. The excise law in Pennsylvania, the embargo and non-intercourse law in the Eastern States, the carriage tax in Virginia, were all deemed unconstitutional, and were more unequal in their operation than any of the laws now complained of; but fortunately, none of those States

discovered that they had the right now claimed by South Carolina.. The war, into which we were forced to support the dignity of the nation and the rights of our citizens, might have ended in defeat and disgrace, instead of victory and honor, if the States who supposed it a ruinous and unconstitutional measure, had thought they possessed the right of nullifying the act by which it was declared, and denying supplies for its prosecution. Hardly and unequally as those measures bore upon several members of the Union, to the legislatures of none did this efficient and peaceable remedy, as it is called, suggest itself. The discovery of this important feature in our Constitution was reserved to the present day. To the statesmen of South Carolina belongs the invention, and upon the citizens of that State will unfortunately fall the evils of reducing it to practice.
If the doctrine of a State veto upon the laws of the Union carries with it internal evidence of its impracticable absurdity, our constitutional history will also afford abundant proof that it would have been repudiated with indignation had it been proposed to form a feature in our government.
In our colonial state, although dependent on another power, we very early considered ourselves as connected by common interest with each other. Leagues were formed for common defence, and before the Declaration of Independence, we were known in our aggregate character as the United Colonies of America. That decisive and important step was taken jointly. We declared ourselves a nation by a joint, not by several acts, and when the terms of our confederation were reduced to form, it was in that of a solemn league of several States, by which they agreed that they would collectively form one nation for the purpose of conducting some certain domestic concerns, and all foreign relations. In the instrument forming that Union is found an article which declares that " every State shall abide by the determinations of Congress, on all questions which, by that confederation, should be submitted to them."
Under the confederation, then, no State could legally annul a decision of the Congress, or refuse to submit to its execution ; but no provision was made to enforce these decisions. Congress made requisitions, but they were not complied with. The government could not operate on individuals. They had no Judiciary, no means of collecting revenue.
But the defects of the confederation need not be detailed. Under its operation we could scarcely be called a nation. We had neither prosperity at home nor consideration abroad. This state of things could not be endured, and our present happy Constitution was formed, but formed in vain, if this fatal doctrine prevails. It was formed for important objects that are announced in the preamble, made in the name and by the authority of the people of the United States, whose delegates framed, and whose conventions approved it. The most important among these objects, that which is placed first in rank, on which all the others rest, is " to form a more perfect Union." Now, is it possible, that even if there were no express provision giving supremacy to the Constitution and laws of the United States over those of the States--can it be conceived, that an instrument made for the purpose of "forming a more perfect Union" than that of the confederation, could be so constructed by the assembled wisdom of our country, as to substitute for that confederation a form of government dependent for its existence on the local interest, the party spirit of a State, or of a prevailing faction in a State ? Every man of plain, unsophisticated understanding, who hears the question, will give such an answer as will preserve the Union. Metaphysical subtlety, in pursuit of an impracticable theory, could alone have devised one that is calculated to destroy it.
I consider, then, the power to annul a law of the United States, assumed by one State, incompatible with the existence of the Union, contradicted expressly by the letter of the Constitution, unauthorized by its spirit, inconsistent with every principle on which it was founded, and destructive of the great object for which it was formed.
After this general view of the leading principle, we must examine the particular application of it which is made in the ordinance.
The preamble rests its justification on these grounds : It assumes, as a fact, that the obnoxious laws, although they purport to be laws for raising revenue, were, in reality, intended for the protection of manufactures, which purpose it asserts to be unconstitutional;--that the operation of these laws is unequal;t-hat the amount raised by them is greater than is required by the wants of the government;--and finally, that the proceeds are to be applied to objects unauthorized by the Constitution. These are the only causes alleged to justify an open opposition to the laws of the country, and a threat of seceding from the Union, if any attempt should be made to enforce them. The first virtually

774

acknowledges that the law in question was passed under a power expressly given by the Constitution to lay and collect imposts; but its constitutionality is drawn in question from the motives of those who passed it. However apparent this purpose may be in the present case, nothing can be more dangerous than to admit the position that an unconstitutional purpose, entertained by the members who assent to a law enacted under a constitutional power, shall make that law void; for how is that purpose to be ascertained ? Who is to make the scrutiny ? How often may bad purposes be falsely imputed--in how many cases are they concealed by false professions--in how many is no declaration of motive made ? Admit this doctrine, and you give to the States an uncontrolled right to decide, and every law may be annulled under this pretext. If, therefore, the absurd and dangerous doctrine should be admitted, that a State may annul an unconstitutional law, or one that it deems such, it will not apply to the present case.
The next objection is, that the laws in question operate unequally. This objection may be made with truth to every law that has been or can be passed. The wisdom of man never yet contrived a system of taxation that would operate with perfect equality. If the unequal operation of a law makes it unconstitutional, and if all laws of that description may be abrogated by any State for that cause, then indeed is the Federal Constitution unworthy of the slightest, effort for its preservation. We have hitherto relied on it as the perpetual bond of our Union. We have received it as the work of the assembled wisdom of the nation. We have trusted to it as to the sheet anchor of our safety in the stormy times of conflict with a foreign or domestic foe. We have looked to it with sacred awe as the palladium of our liberties, and, with all the solemnities of religion, have pledged to each other our lives and fortunes here, and our hopes of happiness hereafter, in its defence and support. Were we mistaken, my countrymen, in attaching this importance to the Constitution of our country ? Was our devotion paid to the wretched, inefficient, clumsy contrivance which this new doctrine would make it ? Did we pledge ourselves to the support of an airy nothing--a bubble that must be blown away by the first breath of disaffection ? Was this self-destroying, visionary theory the work of the profound statesmen, the exalted patriots, to whom the task of constitutional reform was entrusted ? Did the name of Washington sanction, did the States deliberately ratify, such an anomaly in the history of fundamental legislation ? No. We were not mistaken. The letter of this great instrument is free from this radical fault; its language directly contradicts the imputation; its spirit, its evident intent contradicts it. No, we did not err! Our Constitution does not contain the absurdity of giving power to make laws, and another power to resist them. The sages whose memory will always be reverenced, have given us a practical, and, as they hoped, a permanent constitutional compact. The Father of his country did not affix his revered name to so palpable an absurdity. Nor did the States, when they severally ratified it, do so under the impression that a veto on the laws of the United States was reserved to them, or that they could exercise it by implication. Search the debates in all their conventions,--examine the speeches of the most zealous opposers of Federal authority,--look at the amendments that were proposed,--they are all silent, not a syllable uttered, not a vote given, not a motion made, to correct the explicit supremacy given to the laws of the Union over those of the States, or to show that implication, as is now contended, could defeat it. No, we have not erred 1 The Constitution is still the object of our reverence, the bond of our Union, our defence in danger, the source of our prosperity in peace. It shall descend, as we have received it, uncorrupted by sophistical construction, to our posterity; and the sacrifices of local interest, of State prejudices, of personal animosities, that were made to bring it into existence, will again be patriotically offered for its support.
The two remaining objections made by the ordinance to these laws, are, that the sums intended to be raised by them are greater than are required, and that the proceeds will be unconstitutionally employed.
The Constitution has given, expressly, to Congress, the right of raising revenue, and of determining the sum the public exigencies will require. The States have no control over the exercise of this right, other than that which results from the power of changing the representatives who abuse it, and thus procure redress. Congress may, undoubtedly, abuse this discretionary power, but the same may be said of others with which they are vested. Yet the discretion must exist somewhere. The Constitution has given it to the representatives of all the people, checked by the representatives of the States and by the executive power. The South Carolina construction gives it to the legislature or the

APPENDIX. PROCLAMATION. No. 26.

775

convention of a single State, where neither the people of the different States, nor the States in their separate capacity, nor the chief magistrate elected by the people, have any representation. Which is the most discreet disposition of the power ? I do not ask you, fellow-citizens, which is the constitutional disposition ; that instrument speaks a language not to be misunderstood. But if you were assembled in general convention, which would you think the safest depository of this discretionary power in the last resort? Would you add a clause giving it to each of the States, or would you sanction the wise provisions already made by your Constitution ? If this should be the result of your deliberations when providing for the future, are you, can you be ready, to risk all that we hold dear, to establish, for a temporary and a local purpose, that which you must acknowledge to be destructive, and even absurd, as a general provision ? Carry out the consequences of this right vested in the different States, and you must perceive that the crisis your conduct presents at this day, would recur whenever any law of the United States displeased any of the States, and that we should soon cease to be a nation.
The ordinance, with the same knowledge of the future that characterizes a former objection, tells you that the proceeds of the tax will be unconstitutionally applied. If this could be ascertained with certainty, the objection would, with more propriety, be reserved for the law so applying the proceeds, but surely cannot be urged against the laws levying the duty.
These are the allegations contained in the ordinance. Examine them seriously, my fellow-citizens,--judge for yourselvs. I appeal to you to determine whether they are so clear, so convincing, as to leave no doubt of their correctness ; and even if you should come to this conclusion, how far they justify the reckless, destructive course which you are directed to pursue. Review these objections, and the conclusions drawn from them, once more. What are they ? Every law, then, for raising revenue, according to the South Carolina ordinance, may be rightfully annulled, unless it be so framed as no law ever will or can be framed. Congress have a right to pass laws for raising revenue, and each State have a right to oppose their execution--two rights directly opposed to each other; and yet is this absurdity supposed to be contained in an instrument drawn for the express purpose of avoiding collisions between the States and the general government, by an assembly of the most enlightened statesmen and purest patriots ever embodied for a similar purpose.
In vain have these sages declared that Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises--in vain have they provided that they shall have power to pass laws which shall be necessary and proper to carry those powers into execution, that those laws and that Constitution shall be the " supreme law of the land, and that the judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any thing in the Constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding." In vain have the people of the several States solemnly sanctioned these provisions, made them their paramount law, and individually sworn to support them whenever they were called on to execute any office. Vain provisions ! ineffectual restrictions! vile profanation of oaths! miserable mockery of legislation !--if a bare majority of the voters in any one State may, on a real or supposed knowledge of the intent with which a law has been passed, declare themselves free from its operation,--say here it gives too little, there too much, and operates unequally;--here it suffers articles to be free that ought to be taxed;-- there it taxes those that ought to be free;--in this case the proceeds are intended to be applied to purposes which we do not approve;--in that the amount raised is more than is wanted. Congress, it is true, are invested by the Constitution with the right of deciding these questions according to their sound discretion ; Congress is composed of the representatives of all the States, and of all the people of all the States; but we, part of the people of one State, to whom the Constitution has given no power on the subject, from whom it has expressly taken it away--we, who have solemnly agreed that this Constitution shall be our law--we, most of whom have sworn to support it--we now abrogate this law, and swear, and force others to swear, that it shall not be obeyed--and we do this not because Congress have no right to pass such laws; this we do not allege, but because they have passed them with improper views. They are unconstitutional from the motives of those who passed them, which we can never with certainty know--from their unequal operation, although it is impossible, from the nature of things, that they should be equal--and from the disposition which we presume may be made of their proceeds, although that disposition has not been declared. This is the plain meaning of the ordinance in relation to laws which it abrogates for alleged unconstitutionality. But it does not stop there. It repeals, in ex-

776

APPENDIX. PROCLAMATION. No. 26.

press terms, an important part of the Constitution itself, and of laws passed to give it effect, which have never been alleged to be unconstitutional.
The Constitution declares that the judicial powers of the United States extend to cases arising under the laws of the United States, and that such laws, the Constitution, and treaties, shall be paramount to the State Constitutions and laws. The judiciary act prescribes the mode by which the case may be brought before a court of the United States, by appeal, when a State tribunal shall decide against this provision of the Constitution. The ordinance declares there shall be no appeal--makes the State law paramount to the Constitution and laws of the United States--forces judges and jurors to swear that they will disregard their provisions; and even makes it penal in a suitor to attempt relief by appeal. It further declares that it shall not be lawful for the authorities of the United States, or of that State, to enforce the payment of duties imposed by the revenue laws within its limits.
Here is a law of the United States, not even pretended to be unconstitutional, repealed by the authority of a small majority of the voters of a single State. Here is a provision of the Constitution which is solemnly abrogated by the same authority.
On such expositions and reasonings, the ordinance grounds not only an assertion of the right to annul the laws of which it complains, but to enforce it by a threat of seceding from the Union if any attempt is made to execute them.
This right to secede is deduced from the nature of the Constitution, which, they say, is a compact between Sovereign States, who have preserved their whole sovereignty, and therefore, are subject to no superior; that, because they made the compact, they can break it when, in their opinion, it has been departed from by the other States. Fallacious as this course of reasoning is, it enlists State pride, and finds advocates in the honest prejudices of those who have not studied the nature of our government sufficiently to see the radical error on which it rests.
The people of the United States formed the Constitution, acting through the State legislatures in making the compact, to meet and discuss its provisions, and acting in separate conventions when they ratified those provisions; but the terms used in its Construction, show it to be a government in which the people of all the States, collectively, are represented. We are one people in the choice of President and Vice-President. Here the States have no other agency than to direct the mode in which the votes shall be given. The candidates having the majority of all the votes are chosen. The electors of a majority of States may have given their votes for one candidate, and yet another may be chosen. The people then, and not the States, are represented in the Executive branch.
In the House of Representatives there is this difference, that the people of one State do not, as in the case of President and Vice-President, all vote for the same officers. The people of all the States do not vote for all the members, each State electing only its own representatives. But this creates no material distinction. When chosen, they are all representatives of the United States, not representatives of the particular State from which they come. They are paid by the United States, not by the State; nor are they accountable to it for any act done in the performance of their legislative functions; and however they may in practice, as it is their duty to do, consult and prefer the interests of their particular constituents when they come in conflict with any other partial or local interest, yet it is their first and highest duty, as representatives of the United States, to promote the general good.
The Constitution of the United States then forms a government not a league ; and whether it be formed by compact between the States, or in any other manner, its character is the same. It is a government in which all the people are represented, which operates directly on the people individually,' not upon the States--they retained all the power they did not grant. But each State having expressly parted with so many powers as to constitute, jointly with the other States, a single nation, cannot, from that period, possess any right to secede, because such secession does not break a league, but destroys the unity of a nation ; and any injury to that unity is not only a breach which would result from the contravention of a compact, but it is an offence against the whole Union. To say that any State may at pleasure secede from the Union, is to say that the United States are not a nation, because it would be a solecism to contend that any part of a nation might dissolve its connection with the other parts, to their injury or ruin, without committing any offence. Secession, like any other revolutionary act, may be morally justified by the extremity of oppression; but to call it a constitutional right, is confounding the meaning of terms, and can only

APPENDIX. PROCLAMATION. No. 26.

777

be done through gross error, or to deceive those who are willing to assert a right, would pause before they made a revolution, or incur the penalties conse-
quent on a failure. Because the Union was formed by compact, it is said the parties to that com-
pact may, when they feel themselves aggrieved, depart from it; but it is precisely because it is a compact that they cannot. A compact is an agreement or binding obligation. It may by its terms have a sanction or penalty for its breach, or it may not. If it contains no sanction, it may be broken with no other consequence than moral guilt; if it have a sanction, then the breach incurs the designated or implied penalty. A league between independent nations, generally, has no sanction, other than a moral one; or if it should contain a penalty, as there is no common superior, it cannot be enforced. A government, on the contrary, always has a sanction, express or implied; and, in our case, it is both necessarily implied and expressly given. An attempt, by force of arms, to destroy a government, is an offence, by whatever means the constitutional compact may have been formed; and such government has the right, by the law of self-defence, to pass acts for punishing the offender, unless that right is modified, restrained, or resumed by the constitutional act. In our system, although it is modified in the case of treason, yet authority is expressly given to pass all laws necessary to carry its powers into effect, and under this grant, provision has been made for punishing acts which obstruct the due administration of the laws.
It would seem superfluous to add any thing to show the nature of that union which connects us; but, as erroneous opinions on this subject are the foundation of doctrines the most destructive to our peace, I must give some further development to my views on this subject. No one, fellow-citizens, has a higher reverence for the reserved rights of the States, than the Magistrate who now addresses you. No one would make greater personal sacrifices, or official exertions, to defend them from violation ; but equal care must be taken to prevent, on their part, an improper interference with, or resumption of, the rights they have vested in the nation. The line has not been so distinctly drawn as to avoid doubts in some cases of the exercise of power. Men of the best intentions and soundest views may differ in their construction of some parts of the Constitution ; but there are others on which dispassionate reflection can leave no doubt. Of this nature appears to be the assumed right of secession. It rests, as we have seen, on the alleged undivided sovereignty of the States, and on their having formed, in this sovereign capacity, a compact which is called the Constitution, from which, because they made it, they have the right to secede. Both of these positions are erroneous, and some of the arguments to prove them so have been anticipated.
The States severally have not retained their entire sovereignty. It has been shown that, in becoming parts of a nation, not members of a league, they surrendered many of their essential parts of sovereignty. The right to make treaties--declare war--levy taxes--exercise exclusive judicial and legislative powers--were all of them functions of sovereign power. The States, then, for all these important purposes, were no longer sovereign. The allegiance of their citizens was transferred, in the first instance, to the government of the United States--they became American citizens, and owed obedience to the Constitution of the United States, and to laws made in conformity with the powers it vested in Congress. This last position has not been, and cannot be denied. How, then, can that State be said to be sovereign and independent whose citizens owe obedience to laws not made by it, and whose magistrates are sworn to disregard those laws when they come in conflict with those passed by another ? What shows conclusively that the States cannot be said to have reserved an undivided sovereignty, is, that they expressly ceded the right to punish treason--not treason against their separate power--but treason against the United States. Treason is an offence against sovereignty, and sovereignty must reside with the power to punish it. But the reserved rights of the States are not less sacred because they have, for their common interest, made the general government the depository of these powers. The unity of our political character (as has been shown for another purpose) commenced with its very existence. Under the royal government we had no separate character; our opposition to its oppressions began as United Colonies. We were the United States under the confederation, and the name was perpetuated, and the Union rendered more perfect by the Federal Constitution. In none of these stages did we consider ourselves in any other light than as forming one nation. Treaties and alliances were made in the name of all. Troops were raised for the joint defence. How, then, with all these proofs, that, under all changes of our position we had, for designated purposes and with defined powers, created national governments-- how is it, that the most perfect of those several modes of union should now be

considered as a mere league that may be dissolved at pleasure ? It is from an abuse of terms. Compact is used as synonomous with league, although the true term is not employed, because it would at once show the fallacy of the reasoning. It would not do to say that our Constitution was only a league, but it is labored to prove it a compact, (which in one sense it is,) and then to argue that as league is a compact, every compact between nations must of course be a league, and that from such an engagement every sovereign power has a right to recede. But it has been shown that, in this sense, the States are not sovereign, and that even if they were, and the national Constitution had been formed by compact, there would be no right in any one State to exonerate itself from its obligations.
So obvious are the reasons which forbid this secession, that it is necessary only to allude to them. The Union was formed for the benefit of all. It was produced by mutual sacrifices of interests and opinions. Can those sacrifices be recalled ? Can the States, who magnanimously surrendered their title to the territories of the West, recall the grant? Will the inhabitants of the inland States agree to pay the duties that may be imposed without their assent by those on the Atlantic or the Gulf, for their own benefit ? Shall there be a free port in one State, and onerous duties in another ? No one believes that any right exists in a single State to involve all the others in these and countless other evils contrary to engagements solemnly made. Every one must see that the other States, in self-defence, must oppose it at all hazards.
These are the alternatives that are presented by the Convention ; a repeal of all the acts for raising revenue, leaving the government without the means of support; or an acquiescence in the dissolution of our Union by the secession of one of its members. When the first was proposed, it was known that it could not be listened to for a moment. It was known, if force was applied to oppose the execution of the laws, that it must be repelled by force; that Congress could not, without involving itself in disgrace, and the country in ruin, accede to the proposition; and yet if this is not done in a given day, or if any attempt is made to execute the laws, the State is, by the ordinance, declared to be out of the Union. The majority of a convention assembled for the purpose, have dictated these terms, or rather this rejection of all terms, in the name of the people of South Carolina. It is true that the governor of the State speaks of the submission of their grievances to a convention of all the States, which, he says, they " sincerely and anxiously seek and desire." Yet this obvious and constitutional mode of obtaining the sense of the other States on the construction of the federal compact, and amending it, if necessary, has never been attempted by those who have urged the State on to this destructive measure. The State might have proposed the call for a general convention to the other States; and Congress, if a sufficient number of them concurred, must have called it. But the first magistrate of South Carolina, when he expressed a hope that " on a review by Congress and the functionaries of the general government, of the merits of the controversy," such a convention will be accorded to them, must have known that neither Congress nor any functionary of the general government, has authority to call such a convention, unless it be demanded by two thirds of the States. This suggestion, then, is another instance of the reckless inattention to the provisions of the Constitution with which this crisis has been madly hurried on; or of the attempt to persuade the people that a constitutional remedy had been sought and refused. If the legislature of South Carolina " anxiously desire " a general convention to consider their complaints, why have they not made application for it in the way the Constitution points out ? The assertion that they " earnestly seek it," is completely negatived by the omission.
This, then, is the position in which we stand. A small majority of the citizens of one State in the Union have elected delegates to a State convention; that convention has ordained that all the revenue laws of the United States must be repealed, or that they are no longer a member of the Union. The governor of that State has recommended to the legislature the raising of an army to carry the secession into effect, and that he may be empowered to give clearances to vessels in the name of the State. No act of violent opposition to the laws has yet been committed, but such a state of things is hourly apprehended; and it is the intent of this instrument to Proclaim, not only that the duty imposed on me by the Constitution, " to take care that the laws be faithfully executed," shall be performed to the extent of the powers already vested in me by law, or of such others as the wisdom of Congress shall devise and entrust to me for that purpose, but to warn the citizens of South Carolina who have been deluded into an opposition to the laws, of the danger they will incur by obedience to the

APPENDIX. PROCLAMATION. No. 26.

779

illegal and disorganizing ordinance of the convention,--to exhort those who have refused to support it, to persevere in their determination to uphold the Constitution and laws of their country,--and to point out to all the perilous situation into which the good people of that State have been led, and that the course they are urged to pursue is one of ruin and disgrace to the very State whose rights they affect to support.
Fellow citizens of my native State !--let me not only admonish you, as the First Magistrate of our common country, not to incur the penalty of its laws, but use the influence that a father would over his children whom he saw rushing to certain ruin. In that paternal language, with that paternal feeling, let me tell you, my countrymen, that you are deluded by men who are either deceived themselves, or wish to deceive you. Mark under what pretences you have been led on to the brink of insurrection and treason, on which you stand ! First, a diminution of the value of your staple commodity, lowered by over production in other quarters, and the consequent diminution in the value of your lands, were the sole effect of the tariff laws. The effect of those laws was confessedly injurious, but the evil was greatly exaggerated by the unfounded theory you were taught to believe, that its burthens were in proportion to your exports, not to your consumption of imported articles. Your pride was roused by the assertion that a submission to those laws was a state of vassalage, and that resistance to them was equal, in patriotic merit, to the opposition our fathers offered to the oppressive laws of Great Britain. You were told that this opposition might be peaceably--might be constitutionally made--that you might enjoy all the advantages of the Union, and bear none of its burthens. Eloquent appeals to your passions, to your State pride, to your native courage, to your sense of real injury, were used to prepare you for the period when the mask, which concealed the hideous features of disunion, should be taken off It fell, and you were made to look with complacency on objects which, not long since, you would have regarded with horror. Look back to the arts which have brought you to this state--look forward to the consequences to which it must inevitably lead! Look back to what was first told you as an inducement to enter into this dangerous course. The great political truth was repeated to you, that you had the revolutionary right of resisting all laws that were palpably unconstitutional and intolerably oppressive--it was added that the right to nullify a law rested on the same principle, but that it was a peaceable remedy! This character which was given to it, made you receive, with too much confidence, the assertions that were made of the unconstitutionality of the law and its oppressive effects. Mark, my fellow citizens, that by the admission of your leaders, the unconstitutionality must be palpable, or it will not justify either resistance or nullification!What is the meaning of the word palpable, in the sense in which it is here used ? that which is apparent to every one; that which no man of ordinary intellect will fail to perceive. Is the unconstitutionality of these laws of that description? Let those among your leaders who once approved and advocated the principle of protective duties, answer the question ; and let them choose whether they will be considered as incapable, then, of perceiving that which must have been apparent to every man of common understanding, or as imposing upon your confidence, and endeavoring to mislead you now. In either case, they are unsafe guides, in the perilous path they urge you to tread. Ponder well on this circumstance, and you will know how to appreciate the exaggerated language they address to you. They are not champions of liberty emulating the fame of our Revolutionary Fathers; nor are you an oppressed people, contending, as they repeat to you, against worse than colonial vassalage. You are free members of a flourishing and happy Union. There is no settled design to oppress you. You have indeed felt the unequal operation of laws which may have been unwisely, not unconstitutionally passed; but that inequality must necessarily be removed. At the very moment when you were madly urged on to the unfortunate course you have begun, a change in public opinion had commenced. The nearly approaching payment of the public debt, and the consequent necessity of a diminution of duties, had already produced a considerable reduction, and that, too, on some articles of general consumption in your State. The importance of this change was underrated, and you were authoritatively told that no further alleviation of your burthens was to be expected, at the very time when the condition of the country imperiously demanded such a modification of the duties as should reduce them to a just and equitable scale. But, as if apprehensive of the effect of this change in allaying your discontents, you were precipitated into the fearful state in which you now find yourselves.
I have urged you to look back to the means that were used to hurry you on

to the position you have now assumed, and forward to the consequences it will produce. Something more is necessary. Contemplate the condition of that country of which you still form an important part!--Consider its Government uniting in one bond of common interest and general protection so many different States-- giving to all their inhabitants the proud title of American Citizens--protecting their commerce--securing their literature and their arts--facilitating their intercommunication--defending their frontiers--and making their name respected in the remotest parts of the earth ! Consider the extent of its territory, its increasing and happy population, its advance in arts, which render life agreeable, and the sciences which elevate the mind ! See education spreading the lights of religion, humanity, and general information into every cottage in this wide extent of our Territories and States 1 Behold it as the asylum where the wretched and the oppressed find a refuge and support! Look on this picture of happiness and honor, and say, we, too, are citizens of America ! Carolina is one of these proud States--her arms have defended, her best blood has cemented this happy Union ! And then add, if you can, without horror and remorse, this happy Union we will dissolve--this picture of peace and prosperity we will deface--this free intercourse we will interrupt--these fertile fields we will deluge with blood--the protection of that glorious flag we renounce--the very name of Americans we discard. And for what, mistaken men ! for what do you throw away these inestimable blessings ? for what would you exchange your share in the advantages and honor of the Union ? For the dream of a separate independence--a dream interrupted by bloody conflicts with your neighbors, and a vile dependence on a foreign power. If your leaders could succeed in establishing a separation, what would be your situation ? Are you united at home-- are you ftee from the apprehension of civil discord, with all its fearful consequences? Do our neighboring republics, every day suffering some new revolution, or contending with some new insurrection--do they excite your envy ? But the dictates of a high duty oblige me solemnly to announce that you cannot succeed. The laws of the United States must be executed. I have no discretionary power on the subject--my duty is emphatically pronounced in the Constitution. Those who told you that you might peaceably prevent their execution, deceived you--they could not have been deceived themselves. They know that a forcible opposition could alone prevent the execution of the laws, and they know that such opposition must be repelled. Their object is disunion ; but be not deceived by names: disunion, by armed force, is treason. Are you really ready to incur its guilt ? If you are, on the heads of the instigators of the act be the dreadful consequences--on their heads be the dishonor, but on yours may fall the punishment--on your unhappy State will inevitably fall all the evils of the conflict you force upon the Government of your country. It cannot accede to the mad project of disunion, of which you would be the first victims--its First Magistrate cannot, if he would, avoid the performance of his duty--the consequence must be fearful for you, distressing to your fellow citizens here, and to the friends of good government throughout the world. Its enemies have beheld our prosperity with a vexation they could not conceal--it was a standing refutation of their slavish doctrines, and they will point to our discord with the triumph of malignant joy. It is yet in your power to disappoint them. There is yet time to show that the descendants of the Pinckneys, the Sumpters, the Rutledges, and of the thousand other names which adorn the pages of your revolutionary history, will not abandon that Union, to support which so many of them fought, and bled and died.
I adjure you, as you honor their memory--as you love the cause of freedom, to which they dedicated their lives--as you prize the peace of your country, the lives of its best citizens, and your own fair fame, to retrace your steps. Snatch from the archives of your State, the disorganizing edict of its Convention--bid its members to re-assemble, and promulgate the decided expressions of your will to remain in the path which alone can conduct you to safety, prosperity and honor. Tell them that, compared to disunion, all other evils are light, because that brings with it an accumulation of all--declare that you will never take the field unless the star-spangled banner of your country shall float over you--that you will not be stigmatized when dead, and dishonored and scorned while you live, as the authors of the first attack on the Constitution of your country!--Its destroyers you cannot be. You may disturb its peace--you may interrupt the course of its prosperity--you may cloud its reputation for stability--but its tranquillity will be restored, its prosperity will return, and the stain upon its national character will be transferred, and remain an eternal blot on the memory of those who caused the disorder.

Fellow-citizens of the United States! The threat of unhallowed disunion-- the names of those once respected, by whom it is uttered--the array of military force to support it--denote the approach of a crisis in our affairs, on which the continuance of our unexampled prosperity, our political existence, and perhaps that of all free governments may depend. The conjuncture demanded a free, a full, and explicit enunciation, not only of my intentions, but of my principles of action ; and as the claim was asserted of a right by a State to annul the laws of the Union, and even to secede from it at pleasure, a frank exposition of my opinions in relation to the origin and form of our government, and the construction I give to the instrument by which it was created, seemed to be proper. Having the fullest confidence in the justness of the legal and constitutional opinion of my duties, which has been expressed, I rely, with equal confidence, on your undivided support in my determination to execute the laws--to preserve the Union by all constitutional means--to arrest, if possible, by moderate but firm measures, the necessity of a recourse to force ; and, if it be the will of Heaven, that the recurrence of its primeval curse on man for the shedding of a brother's blood should fall upon our land, that it be not called down by any offensive act on the part of the United States.
Fellow-citizens! The momentous case is before you. On your undivided support of your government depends the decision of the great question it involves, whether your sacred Union will be preserved, and the blessing it secures to us as one people, shall be perpetuated. No one can doubt that the unanimity with which that decision will be expressed, will be such as to inspire new confidence in republican institutions, and that the prudence, the wisdom, and the courage which it will bring to their defence, will transmit them unimpaired and invigorated to our children.
May the great Ruler of Nations grant that the signal blessings with which he has favored ours, may not, by the madness of party or personal ambition, be disregarded and lost; and may his wise Providence bring those who have produced this crisis to see the folly, before they feel the misery of civil strife; and inspire a returning veneration for that Union which, if we may dare to penetrate his designs, he has chosen as the only means of attaining the high destinies to which we may reasonably aspire.
In testimony whereof, I have caused the seal of the United States to be hereunto affixed, having signed the same with my hand.
Done at the city of Washington, this 10th day of December, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and thirty-two, and of the
[L. S.] Independence of the United States the fifty-seventh.
