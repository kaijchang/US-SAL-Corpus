years, commencing on the first of January, eighteen hundred and fiftyseven, eleven thousand dollars.
And whereas, upon manifestation of great unwillingness on the part of
said Indians to remove to the country west of the Mississippi River, upon Crow Wing, which had been assigned them, and a desire to remain in the State of Wisconsin, the President consented to their locating temporarily
upon the Wolf and Oconto Rivers. Now, therefore, to render practicable the stipulated payments herein
recited, and to make exchange of the lands given west of the Mississippi
for those desired by the tribe, and for the purpose of giving them the
same for a permanent home, these articles are entered into. Articl e 1. The said Menomonee tribe agree to cede, and do hereby

It being understood that all other beneficial stipulations in said treaty of 1848 are to be fulfilled as therein provided.
Artic le 4. In consideration of the difference in extent between the lands hereby ceded to the United States, and the lands given in exchange, and for and in consideration of the provisions hereinbefore recited, and of the relinquishment by said tribe of all claims set up by or for them, for the difference in quantity of lands supposed by them to have been ceded in the treaty of eighteenth of October, eighteen hundred and fortyeight, and what was actually ceded, the United States agree to pay said tribe the sum of one hundred and fifty thousand d*ollars, in fifteen annual instalments, commencing with the year 1867 ; each instalment to be paid out and expended under the direction of the President of the United States, and for such objects, uses, and purposes, as he shall judge necessary and proper for their wants, improvement, and civilization.

royal government of Lew Chew was entered into at Napa, by their re-

spective plenipotentiaries on the eleventh day of July, one thousand eight

hundred and fifty-four, which compact is word for word as follows: --

Hereafter, whenever citizens of the United States come to Lew Chew,

they shall be treated with great courtesy and friendship. Whatever

articles these people ask for, whether from the officers or people, which

the country can furnish, shall be sold to them; nor shall the authorities

interpose any prohibitory regulations to the people selling, and whatever

either party may wish to buy shall be exchanged at reasonable prices.

Whenever ships of the United States shall come into any harbor in

Lew Chew they shall be supplied with wood and water at reasonable

prices; but if they wish to get other articles, they shall be purchasable

only at Napa.

If ships of the United States are wrecked on Great Lew Chew, or on

islands under the jurisdiction of the royal government of Lew Chew, the

local authorities shall dispatch persons to assist in saving life and prop-

erty, and preserve what can be brought ashore till the ships of that

nation shall come to take away all that may have been saved; and the

expenses incurred in rescuing these unfortunate persons shall be refunded by the nation they belong to.

Whenever persons from ships of the United States come ashore in

Lew Chew, they shall be at liberty to ramble where they please without hindrance or having officials sent to follow them, or to spy what they do;

but if they violently go into houses, or trifle with women, or force people

to sell them things, or do other such like illegal acts, they shall be arrested

by the local officers, but not maltreated, and shall be reported to the cap-

tain of the ship to which they belong for punishment by him.

At Tumai is a burial-ground for the citizens of the United States, where their graves and tombs shall not be molested.

The government of Lew Chew shall appoint skillful pilots, who shall

be on the lookout for ships appearing off the island, and if one is seen

coming towards Napa, they shall go out in good boats beyond the reefs to

conduct her in to a secure anchorage, for which service the captain shall

pay the pilot five dollars, and the same for going out of the harbor beyond

the reefs. Whenever ships anchor at Napa, the officers shall furnish them with

wood at the rate of three thousand six hundred copper cash per thousand

catties; and with water at the rate of 600 copper cash (43 cents) for one

thousand catties, or six barrels full, each containing 30 American

gallons. Signed in the English and Chinese languages, by Commodore Matthew

the return home of the delegates here contracting, and upon consultation

with their people, and after an exploration if required by them, in com-

pany with their agent, a location to that extent can be found within said

specified section of country suited to their wants and wishes. And it is

also further provided, That should a suitable location, upon examination

and consultation, to the full extent of one hundred and fifty thousand

acres, not be found within said western part of this cession, then the said

delegates and agent shall be permitted to extend the location beyond the

western line of the country herein ceded and north of the recent Dela-

ware line over so much of the public domain, otherwise unappropriated,

as shall make up the deficiency -- or to make a selection entirely beyond

shall describe their selection, which must be made within six months from the date hereof, by metes and bounds, and transmit the description thereof, signed by said delegates and agent, to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs; and thereupon, the selection so made, shall be taken and deemed as the future permanent home of the Kickapoo Indians. It is expressly understood that the Kickapoos shall claim under this article no more than one hundred and fifty thousand acres of land; and if that

And as the Kickapoos will remove to a new home, and will, therefore, require the principal portion of the annual payments for several years to aid in building houses, in breaking and fencing land, in buying stock, agricultural implements, and other articles needful for their comfort and civilization, it is understood that such portion of said annual
payments as may be necessary, will be appropriated to, and expended for such purposes.
Arti cle 3. The President may cause to be surveyed, in the same -manner in which the public lands are surveyed, the reservation herein provided for the Kickapoos; and may assign to each person, or family desiring it, such quantity of land as, in his opinion, will be sufficient for such person, or family, with the understanding that he, or they, will occupy, improve, and cultivate the same, and comply with such other con-
ditions as the President may prescribe. The land thus assigned may hereafter be confirmed by patent to the parties, or their representatives, under such regulations and restrictions as Congress may impose.
Articl e 4. It is agreed that the United States shall pay to such of the Kickapoos, as have improvements upon the lands hereby ceded, a fair compensation for the same -- the value to be ascertained in such mode as shall be prescribed by the President.
Articl e 5. The debts of Indians contracted in their private dealings as individuals, whether to traders or others, shall not be paid out of the general fund.
Articl e 6. It is the desire of the Kickapoo Indians that their faithful friend and interpreter, Peter Cadue, should have a home provided for him and his family. It is therefore agreed that there shall be assigned to him a tract of land equal to one section, to be taken from the legal subdi-
visions of the surveyed land, and to include his present residence and improvement on Cadue's creek, and the President is authorized to issue a patent to him for the same .

vey to be commenced and prosecuted as the President of the United States

may deem best. And the President will, so soon as the whole or any

the amount provided in the third article as a consideration for the " out-

let," shall be paid to their five chiefs, to wit: Captain Ketchem, Sarkoxey,

treaties, shall be paid as directed by said treaties.

people, it is agreed that all the money not necessary for the reasonable

wants of the people, shall from time to time be invested by the President

of the United States, in safe and profitable stocks, the principal to remain

unimpaired, and the interest to be applied annually for the civilization,

education, and religious culture of the Delaware people, and such other

objects of a beneficial character, as in his judgment, are proper and

necessary.

Same subject. Arti cle 8. As the annual receipts from the sales of the lands can-

not now be determiged, it is agreed that the whole subject be referred to

the judgment of the President, who may, from time to time, prescribe how much of the net proceeds of said sales shall be paid out to the Dela-

ware people, and the mode and manner of such payment, also how much

shall be invested, and in distributing the funds to the people, due regard

and encouragement shall be given to that portion of the Delawares who

are competent to manage their own affairs, and who know and appreciate

the value of money; but Congress may, at any time, and from time to

time, by law, make such rules and regulations in relation to the funds

arising from the sale of said lands, and the application thereof for the

benefit and improvement of the Delaware people, as may, in the wisdom

of that body, seem just and proper.

so that every one may become civilized, and, as many now are, competent

to manage their business affairs; but should some of them, unfortunately

continue to refuse to labor, and remain or become dissipated and worth-

United States ; and railroad companies, when the lines of their roads necessarily pass through the said reservation, shall have the right of way, on payment of a just compensation therefor in money.
Articl e 13. The Christian Indians live in the country herein ceded, and have some improvements. They desire to remain where they are, and the Delawares are willing, provided the Christian Indians can pay
them for the land. It is therefore agreed that there shall be confirmed by patent to the said Christian Indians, subject to such restrictions as Congress may provide, a quantity of land equal to four sections, to be selected in a body from the surveyed lands, and to include their present improvements: Provided, The said Christian Indians, or the United States for them, pay to the Secretary of the Interior for the use of the Delaware Indians, within one year from the date of the ratification of this treaty, the sum of two dollars and fifty cents per acre therefor : And providedfurther, That the provisions of article twelve, in relation to roads, highways, and railroads, shall be applicable to the land thus granted to the Christian Indians.

cated by it, when they are injured. Arti cle 15. A primary object of this instrument being to advance
the interests and welfare of the Delaware people, it is agreed, that if it

promote the interests, peace, and happiness of the Delaware people. Articl e 16. It is agreed by the parties hereto, that the provisions
of the act of Congress, approved third of March, one thousand eight

The government of the United States being equally desirous with her Majesty the Queen of Great Britain to avoid further misunderstanding
between their respective citizens and subjects, in regard to the extent of the right of fishing on the coasts of British North America, secured to
each by article 1 of a convention between the United States and Great Britain, signed at London on the 20th day of October, 1818; and being
also desirous to regulate the commerce and navigation between their respective territories and people, and more especially between her Majesty's possessions in North America and the United States, in such manner as to render the same reciprocally beneficial and satisfactory, have, respectively, named plenipotentiaries to confer and agree thereupon--that is to say, the President of the United States of America, William L. Marcy, Secretary of State of the United States, and her Majesty the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, James, Earl of Elgin
and Kincardine, Lord Bruce and Elgin, a peer of the United Kingdom, Knight of the most ancient and most noble Ordei' of the Thistle, and governor-general in and over all her Britannic Majesty's provinces on the continent of North America, and in and over the island of Prince Edward--who, after having communicated to each other their respective
full powers, found in good and due form, have agreed upon the following
articles: -- Artic le 1. It is agreed by the high contracting parties that, in addi-
tion to the liberty secured to the United States fishermen by the abovementioned convention of October 20, 1818, of taking, curing, and drying
fish on certain coasts of the British North American colonies therein defined, the inhabitants of the United States shall have, in common with the subjects of her Britannic Majesty, the liberty to take fish of every kind,
except shell-fish, on the sea-coasts and shores, and in the bays, harbors,
and creeks of Canada, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward's Island, and of the several islands thereunto adjacent, without being re-
stricted to any distance from the shore, with permission to land upon the coasts and shores of those colonies and the islands thereof, and also upon the Magdalen Islands, for the purpose of drying their nets and curing their fish : provided that, in so doing, they do not interfere with the rights
of private property, or with British fishermen, in the peaceable use of any part of the said coast in their occupancy for the same purpose.
It is understood that the above-mentioned liberty applies solely to the
sea fishery, and that the salmon and shad fisheries, and all fisheries in
rivers and the mouths of rivers, are hereby reserved, exclusively, for
British fishermen. And it is further agreed, that in order to prevent or settle any disputes

six months thereafter, appoint a commissioner. The said commissioners,

before proceeding to any business, shall make and subscribe a solemn

declaration that they will impartially and carefully examine and decide,

fear, favor, or affection to their own country, upon all such places as are

intended to be reserved and excluded from the common liberty of fishing,

under this and the next succeeding article, and such declaration shall be

entered on the record of their proceedings.

which of the two persons so named shall be the arbitrator or umpire in

cases of difference or disagreement between the commissioners. The

person so to be chosen to be arbitrator or umpire shall, before proceeding

to act as such in any case, make and subscribe a solemn declaration in a

form similar to that which shall already have been made and subscribed

by the commissioners, which shall be entered on the record of their pro-

ceedings. In the event of the death, absence, oi' incapacity of either of

Whereas the Shawnee Indians in full council assembled did, on the 21st day of August, 1854, assent to the amendments of the Senate of the
2d of August, 1854, to the Articles of Agreement and Convention, concluded between them and the United States on the 10th of May, 1854, which assent was coupled with conditions as follows : " But this assent is given on the condition that neither the present or any future

And whereas the Secretary of the Department of the Interior, having in his letter of September 12th, 1854, to the Superintendent of Indian Affairs at St. Louis, expressed the opinion that
the above-named conditions were of such a character as to require the constitutional action of the Senate, before the treaty could be proclaimed or executed. And whereas the said Shawnee Indians are now in full council assembled to take into consideration the suggestion or advice of the Secretary of the Interior that the assent to said amendments should be unconditional. Therefore, we the chiefs, councillors, and head men of said tribe, in their behalf, and by their direction, and in review of the suggestions in the letter of the Secretary of the Interior, do rescind the said conditions, and hereby assent to the said amendments, and uncondi-

over twenty-one years of age, eighty acres of land for his or their sepa-

rate use ; and he may, at his discretion, as fast as the occupants become

capable of transacting their own affairs, issue patents therefor to such

occupants, with such restrictions of the power of alienation as he may see

fit to impose. And he may also, at his discretion, make rules and regula-

tions, respecting the disposition of the lands in case of the death of the

head of a family, or single person occupying the same, or in case of its

abandonment by them. And he may also assign other lands in exchange for

Creek, Douglass county, Oregon Territory, this twenty-ninth day of No-
vember, one thousand eight hundred and fifty-four, by Joel Palmer,
superintendent of Indian affairs, on the part of the United States, and the following named chiefs and heads of the confederated bands of the Umpqua

Artic le First . The confederate bands of Umpqua and Calapooia Indians cede to the United States all their country included within the
following limits, to wit: Commencing at the northwest corner of the country purchased of the Galeese Creek and Illinois River Indians, on the 18th day of November, 1854, and running thqnce east, to the boundary
of the Cow Creek purchase, thence northerly along said boundary to its northeastern extremity; thence east to the main ridge of the Cascade Mountains; thence northerly to the main falls of the North Umpqua
River; thence to Scott's Peak, bearing easterly from the head-waters of
Calapooia Creek; thence northerly to the connection of the Calapooia
Mountains with the Cascade range; thence westerly along the summit of the Calapooia Mountains to a point whence a due south line would cross Umpqua River at the head of tide-water ; thence on that line to the dividing ridge between the waters of Umpqua and Coose Rivers ; thence along that ridge, and the divide between Coquille and Umpqua rivers, to
the western boundary of the country purchased of the Galeese Creek
Indians, or of the Cow Creek Indians, as the. case may be, and thence to the place of beginning.
Provided, however, that so much of the lands as are embraced within
the following limits, shall be held by said confederated bands, and such other bands as may be designated to reside thereupon, as an Indian reservation. To wit: Commencing at a point three miles due south *of the mouth of a small creek emptying into the Umpqua River, near the
western boundary of John Churchell's land claim, at the lower end of Cole's Valley; thence north to the middle of the channel of Umpqua
River; thence up said river to a point due south of the highest peak of

said peak, thence along the summit of the ridge dividing the waters, to its termination at or near the mouth of Little Canyon Creek; thence, crossing the Umpqua River in a westerly direction to the highlands
opposite the mouth of said creek; thence following the divide until it
reaches a point whence a line drawn to the place of beginning will run
three miles south of the extreme southern bend in the Umpqua River between these two points; and thence to the place of beginning. And
should the President at any time believe it demanded by the public good
and promotive of the best interests of said Indians to be located elsewhere, the said Indians agree peaceably, and without additional expense
to the government of the United States, to remove to such reserve as may be selected ; provided that a delegation of three or more of the prin-
cipal men of said bands selected by them, shall concur with the authorized agent or agents of the United States in the selection of said new reserve.
