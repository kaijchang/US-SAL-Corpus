does not, in the opinion of the Board, or, upon redetermination, in

such costs, such costs shall be determined in accordance with such

method as in the opinion of the Board, or, upon redetermination, in

the opinion of The Tax Court of the United States, does properly reflect

ments or subcontracts, except that the Board may exercise such powers

separately with respect to amounts received or accrued by the con-

tractor or subcontractor under any one or more separate contracts with

the Departments or subcontracts at the request of the contractor or

subcontractor. By agreement with any contractor or subcontractor,

to be allotted to new farms under subsection (f) of this section, shall mraits.

be apportioned among the States on the basis of the larger of the ''*'^"

following for each State: (a) The acreage allotted to the State as

its share of the 1950 national acreage allotment of two million one

hundred thousand acres, or (b) the State's share of two million one

hundred thousand acres apportioned to States on the basis of the

average acreage harvested for nuts in each State in the five years

1945-1949: Provided, That any allotment so determined for any State

which is less than the 1951 State allotment announced by the Secretary

prior to the enactment of this Act shall be increased to such announced

allotment and the acreage required for such increases shall be in addi-

tion to the 1951 national acreage allotment and shall be considered in

determining State acreage allotments in future years. For any year

subsequent to 1951, the national acreage allotment for that year, less

the acreage to be allotted to new farms under subsection (f) of this

section, shall be apportioned among the States on the basis of their

share of the national acreage allotment for the most recent year in

which such apportionment was made.

" ( 2 ) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the Secretary

of Agriculture determines, on the basis of the average yield per acre

of peanuts by types during the preceding five years, adjusted for trends

in yields and abnormal conditions of production affecting yields in

such five years, t h a t the supply of any type or types of peanuts for any

marketing year, beginning with the 1951-1952 marketing year, will

be insufficient to meet the estimated demand for cleaning and shelling

purposes at prices at which the Commodity Credit Corporation may

sell for such purposes peanuts owned or controlled by it, the State

allotments for those States producing such type or types of peanuts

shall be increased to the extent determined by the Secretary to be

required to meet such demand but the allotment for any State may

not be increased under this provision above the 1947 harvested acreage

of peanuts for such State. The total increase so determined shall be

apportioned among such States for distribution among farms produc-

ing peanuts of such type or types on the basis of the average acreage

of peanuts of such type or types in the tliree years immediately pre-

ceding the year for which the allotments are being determined. The

additional acreage so required shall be in addition to the national

acreage allotment, the production from such acreage shall be in addi-

tion to the national marketing quota, and the increase in acreage

allotted under this provision shall not be considered in establishing

future State, county, or farm acreage allotments."

following: Past acreage of peanuts, taking into consideration the

acreage allotments previously established for the farm; abnormal

conditions affecting acreage; land, labor, and equipment available

for the production of peanuts; crop-rotation practices; and soil and

year among the counties in the State on the basis of the past acreage

of peanuts harvested for nuts (excluding acreage in excess of farm

allotments) in the county during the five years immediately preceding

receiving allotments, in amounts determined by the county committee

to be fair and reasonable on the basis of land, labor, and equipment

available for the production of peanuts, crop-rotation practices, and

soil and other physical factors affecting the production of peanuts.

Any transfer of allotments under this provision shall not operate

to reduce the allotment for any subsequent year for the farm from

which acreage is transferred, except as the farm becomes ineligible

"(B) measures for the personal safety, health, welfare and morals of members of the National Security Training Corps;
" ( C ) a code of conduct, together with penalties for violation thereof;

the provisions of section 4 (a) of this Act until the thirty-fifth anniversary of the date of their birth. This proviso shall not be construed to prevent the continued deferment of such persons if otherwise deferable under any other provisions of this Act. The President is also authorized, under such rules and regulations as he may prescribe, to provide for the deferment from training and service in the Armed Forces or from training in the National Security Training Corps (1) of any or all categories of persons in a status with respect to persons (other than wives alone, except in cases of extreme hardship) dependent upon them for support which renders their deferment advisable, and (2) of any or all categories of those persons found to be physically, mentally, or morally deficient or defective. For the purpose of determining whether or not the deferment of any person is advisable, because of his status with respect to persons dependent upon him for support, any payments of allowances which are payable by the United States to the dependents of persons serving in the Armed Forces of the United States or undergoing training in the National Security Training Corps shall be taken into consideration, but the fact that such payments of allowances are payable shall not be deemed conclusively to remove the grounds for deferment when the dependency is based upon financial considerations and shall not be deemed to remove the ground for deferment when the dependency is based upon other than financial considerations and cannot be eliminated by financial assistance to the dependents. The President is also authorized, under such rules and regulations as he may prescribe, to provide for the deferment from training and service in the Armed Forces or training in the National Security Training Corps of any or all categories of persons who have children, or wives and children, with whom they maintain a bona fide family relationship in their homes. No deferment from such training and service in the Armed Forces or training in the National Security Training Corps shall be made in the case of any individual except upon the basis of the status of such individual. There shall be posted in a conspicuous place at the office of each local board a list setting forth the names and classifications of those persons who have been classified by such local board. Notwithstanding any provisions of this Act, no local board, appeal board, or other agency of appeal of the Selective Service System shall be required to postpone or defer any person by reason of his activity in study, research, or medical, dental, veterinary, optometric, osteopathic, scientific, pharmaceutical, chiropractic, chiropodial, or other endeavors found to be necessary to the maintenance of the national health, safety, or interest solely on the basis of any test, examination, selection system, class standing, or any other means conducted, sponsored, administered, or prepared by any agency or department of the Federal Government or any private institution, corporation, association, partnership, or individual employed by an agency or department of the Federal Government."

of appointment, the subsequent exercise of such power shall not be deemed to be the exercise of a f^eneral power of appointment.
"(2) POWERS CREATED AFTER OCTOBER 21, 1942.--To the extent of any property with respect to which the decedent has at the time of his death a general power of appointment created after October 21, 1942, or with respect to which the decedent has at any time exercised or released such a power of appointment by a disposition which is of such nature that if it were a transfer of property owned by the decedent, such property would be includible in the decedent's gross estate under subsection (c) or (d). A disclaimer or renunciation of such a power of appointment shall not be deemed a release of such powder.
"For the purposes of this paragraph (2) the power of appointment shall be considered to exist on the date of the decedent's death even though the exercise of the power is subject to a precedent giving of notice or even though the exercise of the power takes effect only on the expiration of a stated period after its exercise, whether or not on or before the date of the decedent's death notice has been given or the power has been exercised.
"(3) DEFINITION OF GENERAL POWER OF APPOINTMENT.--For the
purposes of this subsection the term 'general power of appointment' means a power which is exercisable in favor of the decedent, his estate, his creditors, or the creditors of his estate; except that--
" (A) A power to consume, invade, or appropriate property for the benefit of the decedent which is limited by an ascertainable standard relating to the health, education, support, or maintenance of the decedent shall not be deemed a general power of appointment.
" ( B ) A power of appointment created on or before October 21, 1942, which is exercisable by the decedent only in conjunction with another person shall not be deemed a general power of appointment.
" ( C ) In the case of a power of appointment created after October 21, 1942, which is exercisable by the decedent only in conjunction with another person--
"(i) if the power is not exercisable by the decedent except in conjunction wdth the creator of the power-- such power shall not be deemed a general power of appointment.
"(ii) if the power is not exercisable by the decedent except in conjunction with a person having a substantial interest in the property, subject to the power, which is adverse to exercise of the power in favor of the decedent--such power shall not be deemed a general power of appointment. For the purposes of this clause a person who, after the death of the decedent, may be possessed of a power of appointment (with respect to the property subject to the decedent's power) which he may exercise in his own favor shall be deemed as having an interest in the property and such interest shall be deemed adverse to such exercise of the decedent's power.
"(iii) if (afterthe application of clauses (i) and (ii)) the power is a general power of appointment and is exercisable in favor of such other person--such power shall be deemed a general power of appointment only in respect

" ( 4 ) CREATION OF ANOTHER POWER I N CERTAIN CASES.--To the
extent of any property with respect to which the decedent (1) by will or (2) by a disposition which is of such nature that if it were a transfer of property owned by the decedent, such property would be includible in the decedent's gross estate under subsection (c), exercises a power of appointment created after October 21, 1942, by creating another power of appointment which under the applicable local law can be validly exercised so as to postpone the vesting of any estate or interest in such property, or suspend the absolute ownership or power of alienation of such property, for a period ascertainable without regard to the date of the creation of the first power.
" ( 5 ) LAPSE OF POWER.--^The lapse of a power of appointment
created after October 21, 1942, during the life of the individual possessing the power shall be considered a release of such power. The rule of the preceding sentence shall apply with respect to the lapse of powers during any calendar year only to the extent that the property which could have been appointed by exercise of such lapsed powers exceeded in value, at the time of such lapse, the greater of the following amounts:
" ( A ) $5,000, or
" ( B ) 5 per centum of the aggregate value, at the time of such lapse, of the assets out of which, or the proceeds of which, the exercise of the lapsed powers could have been satisfied."

" ( 5 ) LAPSE OF POWER.--The lapse of a power of appointment
created after October 21, 1942, during the life of the individual possessing the power shall be considered a release of such power.

(a) I t is hereby found that the national emergency and the national defense program (1) have aggravated the congested situation v^ith regard to housing accommodations existing at the seat of government; (2) have led or will lead to profiteering and other speculative and manipulative practices by some owners of housing accommodations; (3) have rendered or will render ineffective the normal operations of a free market in housing accommodations; and (4) are making it increasingly difficult for persons whose duties or obligations require them to live or work in the District of Columbia to obtain such accommodations. Whereupon it is the purpose of this Act and the policy of the Congress during the existing emergency to prevent undue rent increases and any other practices relating to housing accommodations in the District of Columbia which may tend to increase the cost of living or otherwise impede the national defense program.
" ( b ) The provisions of this Act, and all regulations, orders, and requirements thereunder, shall terminate on June 30,1952; except that as to offenses committed, or rights or liabilities incurred, prior to such expiration date, the provisions of this Act and such regulations, orders, and requirements shall be treated as still remaining in force for the purpose of sustaining any proper suit, action, or prosecution with respect to any such right, liability, or offense.

"(2) For housing accommodations not rented on January 1, 1951, but which had been rented within the year ending on that date, and not under control under this Act during that year, the rent and service to which the landlord and tenant were last entitled within such year.
"(3) For housing accommodations not rented on January 1, 1951, or within the year ending on that date, and not covered by subsection (4) hereof, the rent and service generally prevailing for comparable housing accommodations as determined by the Administrator.
" (4) For housing accommodations under control under this Act on December 31, 1950, the rent and service to which the landlord and tenant were entitled on June 30, 1951; except that upon the filing, by any landlord of any housing accommodations covered by this subsection, of a new rent schedule on a form prescribed by the Administrator and setting forth the pertinent circumstances as indicated by such form, the rent and service shall be adjusted and automatically effective upon the date of filing thereof, (A) for housing accommodations rented on January 1, 1941, or within the year ending on that date, so that the maximum-rent ceiling shall be increased to 20 per centum above the rent heretofore frozen at the level of January 1, 1941, or the last rent in the year 1940, whichever was applicable, plus the

"GENERAL AND SPECIAL ADJUSTMENTS

"SEO. 3. (a) Whenever in the judgment of the Administrator a general increase or decrease since January 1, 1951, in taxes or other maintenance or operating costs or expenses has occurred or is about to occur in such manner and amount as substantially to affect the maintenance and operation of housing accommodations generally or of any particular class of housing accommodations, he may by regulation or order increase or decrease the maximum-rent ceiling or minimum-service standard, or both, for such accommodations or class thereof in such manner or amount as will in his judgment compensate, in whole or in part, for such general increase or decrease. Thereupon such adjusted ceiling or standard shall be the maximumrent ceiling or minimum-service standard for the housing accommodations subject thereto.
"(b) Upon a showing by any landlord of good cause in the judgment of the Administrator that the maximum-rent ceiling on any housing accommodation is substantially lower than the maximum-rent ceiling for comparable housing accommodations located within the same building or group of buildings operated by the same landlord as a single operation, the Administrator may, by special order under this section, adjust such lower ceiling so as to equalize the same with such higher ceiling, and thereupon such adjusted ceilings shall be the maximum-rent ceilings for the housing accommodations subject to such special order.
"(c) Upon the showing bj^ any landlord to the satisfaction of the Administrator that the maximum-rent ceilings, on any comparable housing accommodations located within the same building or group of buildings operated by the same landlord as a single operation, will vary in amount due to the effect of General Orders 12 and 13 or similar general orders, the Administrator may, by special order under this section, adjust any or all of such ceilings so as to equalize the same, and thereupon such adjusted ceilings shall be the maximum-rent ceilings for the housing accommodations subject to such special order.

"(c) Any tenant may petition the Administrator on the ground that the service supplied to him is less than the service established by the minimum-service standard for his housing accommodations; whereupon the Administrator may order that the service be maintained at such minimum-service standard, or that the maximum-rent ceiling be decreased to compensate for a reduction in service, as he deems necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of this Act.
"(d) Any landlord may petition the Administrator for permission to reduce the service supplied by him in connection with any housing accommodations; whereupon the Administrator, if he determines that the reduction of such service is to be made in good faith for valid business reasons and is not inconsistent with carrying out the purposes of this Act, may, by order, reduce the minimum-service standard applicable to such housing accommodations and adjust the maximumrent ceiling downward in such amount as he deems proper to compensate therefor.
"(e) Any tenant may petition the Administrator to adjust the maximum-rent ceiling applicable to his housing accommodations on the ground that such maximum-rent ceiling permits the receipt of an unduly high rent; whereupon the Administrator may by order adjust such maximum-rent ceiling in such manner or amount as shall, in his judgment, effectuate the purposes of this Act and provide a fair and reasonable rent for such housing accommodations, but not less than the generally prevailing rate for comparable housing accommodations.
"(f) A petition made pursuant to this section shall be subject to the provisions of sections 8 and 9 of this Act. Any adjusted maximum-rent ceiling or minimum-service standard ordered pursuant to this section shall be the maximum-rent ceiling or minimum-service standard for the housing accommodations subject thereto; except that, in the event that the adjustment order is stayed or set aside by the court in accordance with section 9 of this Act, the maximum-rent ceiling and minimum-service standard theretofore applicable to such housing accommodations under this Act remain in full force and effect.

any raw or nonprocessed material, there will result a decrease in supplies from high-cost sources of such material, and that the continuation of such supplies is necessary to carry out the objectives of the Act; or

In establishing any maximum rent for any housing accommodations under this subsection the President shall give due consideration to the rents prevailing for such housing accommodations or comparable housing accommodations during the period from May 24, 1950, to June 24, 1950, and he shall make adjustment for such relevant factors as he shall deem to be of general applicability in respect to such accommodations, including increases or decreases in property taxes and other costs within such State, incorporated city, town, or village, or unincorporated area.
" (1) Whenever the Secretary of Defense and the Director of Defense Mobilization, acting jointly, shall determine and certify to the President that any area (whether then or ever controlled or decontrolled under this Act) is a critical defense housing area, the President shall by regulation or order establish such maximum rent or maximum rents for any housing accommodations, not then subject to rent control, in such area or portion thereof as in his judgment will be fair and equitable. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 202 (c) the term 'controlled housing accommodations' as applied to any such critical defense housing area shall include all housing accommodations in the area, without exception.

Director of Defense Mobilization, acting jointly. No area shall be certified as a critical defense housing area under the authority granted in this subsection unless all the following conditions exist in such area:
"(1) a new defense plant or installation has been or is to be provided, or an existing defense plant or installation has been or is to be reactivated or its operation substantially expanded;
"(2) substantial in-migration of defense workers or military personnel is required to carry out activities at such plant or installation; and
"(3) a substantial shortage of housing required for such defense workers or militaiy personnel exists or impends which has resulted or threatens to result in excessive rent increases and which impedes or threatens to impede activities of such defense plant or installation.
"(m) Whenever an area has been certified under subsection (1) to be a critical defense housing area, real-estate construction credit controls imposed under title V I of the Defense Production Act of 1950 shall be relaxed to the extent necessary to encourage construction of housing for defense workers and military personnel: Provided^ That the certification, pursuant to subsection (1), that an area is a critical defense housing area shall not be effective in such area for any of the purposes of this section until such real-estate construction credit controls have been relaxed as provided in this subsection to the extent necessary in the determination of the President. The fact that any area has been certified as a critical defense housing area under subsection (1) shall not make such area ineligible for the location of additional defense plants, facilities, or installations, or as a source of additional military procurement of any sort.
" ( n ) No maximum rents shall be established under subsection (1) for housing accommodations in any State where rent control is in effect or in any locality where local rent control is in effect, unless the rent component of the Consumers' Index of the Bureau of Labor Statistics for such State or locality has increased more than the United States average of the rent component of such index during the last six months for which such index is available immediately preceding the establishment of such maximum rents. The rent component of the Consumers' Index of the Bureau of Labor Statistics for any State shall be the average, weighted by population as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, for all reported cities in the State, except that, where only one city is reported, the rent component for the State shall be the rent component for that city. Upon the establishment of maximum rents pursuant to subsection (1) for housing accommodations in a State in which State rent control is in effect. State rent control shall thereupon terminate. Upon the establishment of maximum rents pursuant to subsection (1) for housing accommodations in a locality in which local rent control is in effect, local rent control shall thereupon terminate. The rent component for any locality subject to local rent control shall be the rent component as established by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for that locality. Where data concerning rents have not been heretofore collected for a city in a State having State rent control or for a particular locality which has local rent control, the President may cause a survey to be made by the Bureau of I^abor Statistics for the purpose of establishing a rent component for that State or locality. For the purposes of this subsection, State rent control shall be deemed in effect in any State in which maximum rents are controlled pursuant to State law throughout the State, regardless of whether maximum rents are actually in effect in every locality of the State.
"(o) In order to compensate for increases which have occurred in costs and prices, the maximum rent in effect on the date of enact-

65 STAT.1

ment of this subsection for any housing accommodation shall, upon sworn application, be increased to 120 per centum of the following: The maximum rent for the housing accommodation in effect on June 30,1947 (or if no maximum rent was then in effect for the housing accommodation, the maximum rent then in effect for comparable housing accommodations), plus the amount of any increase allowed or allowable under this Act for major capital improvements or for increases in living space, services, furniture, furnishings, or equipment, and minus any decrease required or requirable under this Act for decreases in living space, services, furniture, furnishings, or equipment, or for substantial deterioration or failure to perform ordinary repair, replacement, or maintenance. Any increase in a maximum rent applied for under this subsection which is based upon the maximum rent in effect on June 30,1947, for the particular housing accommodation and upon increases and decreases actually allowed under this Act shall be effective upon the filing of the application. Nothing in this subsection shall require the reduction of any maximum rent, nor prevent such additional adjustment for increases in costs and prices as the President may deem appropriate."
SEC. 204. Section 205 of the Housing and Rent Act of 1947, as amended^ is amended to read as follows:
"SEC. 205. (a) Any person who demands, accepts, receives, or retains any payment of rent in excess of the maximum rent prescribed under the provisions of this Act, or any regulation, order, or requirement thereunder, shall be liable to the person from whom such payment is demanded, accepted, received, or retained (or shall be liable to the United States as hereinafter provided) for reasonable attorney's fees and costs as determined by the court, plus liquidated damages in the amounts of (1) $50, or (2) not more than three times the amount by which the payment or payments demanded, accepted, received, or retained exceed the maximum rent which could lawfully be demanded, accepted, received, or retained, as the court in its discretion may determine, whichever in either case may be the greater amount: Provided^ That the amount of such liquidated damages shall be the amount of the overcharge or overcharges if the defendant proves that the violation was neither willful nor the result of failure to take practicable precautions against the occurrence of the violation.
"(b) Any person who unlawfully evicts a tenant shall be liable to the person so evicted (or shall be liable to the United States as hereinafter provided) for reasonable attorney's fees and costs as determined by the court, plus liquidated damages in the amounts of (1) one month's rent or $50, whichever is greater, or (2) not more than three times such monthly rent, or $150, whichever is greater: Provided^ That the amount of such liquidated damages shall be the amount of one month's rent or $50, whichever is greater, if the defendant proves that the violation was neither willful nor the result of failure to take practicable precautions against the occurrence of the violation.
"(c) Suit to recover liquidated damages as provided in this section may be brought in any Federal court of competent jurisdiction regardless of the amount involved, or in any State or Territorial court of competent jurisdiction, within one year after the date of violation: Provided^ That if the person from whom such payment is demanded, accepted, received, or retained, or the person wrongfully evicted, either fails to institute an action under this section within thirty days from the date of the occurrence of the violation or is not entitled for any reason to bring the action, the United States may settle the claim arising out of the violation or within one year after the date of violation may institute such action. If such claim is settled or such action is instituted, the person from whom such payment is demanded, accepted, received, or retained, or the person wrongfully evicted,

"SEC. 903. (a) This title is designed to supplement systems of mortgage insurance under other provisions of the National Housing Act in order to assist in providing adequate housing in areas which the President, pursuant to section 101 of the Defense Housing and Community Facilities and Services Act of 1951, shall have determined to be critical defense housing areas.

The principal obligation of such mortgage shall not, however, exceed $8,100 if such dwelling is designed for a single-family residence, or $15,000 if such dwelling is designed for a two-family residence except that the Commissioner may by regulation increase these amounts to not to exceed $9,000 and $16,00^, respectively, in any geographical area where he finds that cost levels so require: Provided, That if the Commissioner finds that it is not feasible within the aforesaid dollar amount limitations to construct dwellings containing three or four bedrooms per family unit without sacrifice of sound standards of construction, design, and livability, he may increase such dollar amount limitations by not exceeding $1,080 for each additional bedroom (as defined by the Commissioner) in excess of two contained in such family unit if he finds that such unit meets sound standards of livability as a three-bedroom or a fourbedroom unit, as the case may be;
"(3) have a maturity satisfactory to the Commissioner but not to exceed thirty years from the date of the insurance of the mortgage;
"(4) contain complete amortization provisions satisfactory to the Commissioner;
"(5) bear interest (exclusive of premium charges for insurance) at not to exceed 4i/^ per centum per annum on the amount of the principal obligation outstanding at any time;

Such premium charges shall be payable by the mortgagee, either in cash or in debentures issued by the Commissioner under this title at par plus accrued interest, in such manner as may be prescribed by the Commissioner: Provided, That the Commissioner may require the payment of one or more such premium charges at the time the mortgage is insured, at such discount rate as he may prescribe not in excess of the interest rate specified in the mortgage.

"(e) Any contract of insurance heretofore or hereafter executed by the Commissioner under this title shall be conclusive evidence of the eligibility of the mortgage for insurance, and the validity of any contract of insurance so executed shall be incontestable in the hands of an approved mortgagee from t h e ' d a t e of the execution of such contract, except for fraud or misrepresentation on the part of such approved mortgagee.
"SEC. 904. (a) I n any case in which the mortgagee under a mortgage insured under section 903 shall have foreclosed and taken possession of the mortgaged property, in accordance with regulations of, and within a period to be determined by, the Commissioner, or shall, with the consent of the Commissioner, have otherwise acquired such property from the mortgagor after default, the mortgagee shall be entitled to receive the benefit of the insurance as hereinafter provided, upon (1) the prompt conveyance to the Commissioner of title to the property which meets the requirements of rules and regulations of the Commissioner in force at the time the mortgage was insured, and which is evidenced in the manner prescribed by such rules and regulations; and (2) the assignment to hini of all claims of the mortgagee against the mortgagor or others, arising out of the mortgage transaction or foreclosure proceedings, except such claims as may have been released with the consent of the Commissioner. Upon such conveyance and assignment the obligation of the mortgagee to pay the premium charges for insurance shall cease and the Commissioner shall, subject to the cash adjustment hereinafter provided, issue to the mortgagee debentures having a total face value equal to the value of the mortgage and a certificate of claim, as hereinafter provided. For the purposes of this subsection, the value of the mortgage shall be determined, in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the Commissioner, by adding to the amount of the original principal obligation of the mortgage which was unpaid on the date of the institution of foreclosure proceedings, or on the date of the acquisition of the property after default other than by foreclosure, the amount of all payments which have been made by the

"(2) not in excess of two-thirds of such cost, whichever is the greater: And provided further^ That with respect to mortgages to which the provisions of sections 302 and 306 of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940, as now or hereafter amended, apply and which are insured under section 903, and subject to such regulations and conditions as the Commissioner may prescribe, there shall be included in the debentures an amount which the Commissioner finds to be sufficient to compensate the mortgagee for any loss which it may have sustained on account of interest on debentures and the payment of insurance premiums by reason of its having postponed the institution of foreclosure proceedings or the acquisition of the property by other means during any part or all of the period of such military service and three months thereafter. "(b) The Commissioner may at any time, under such terms and conditions as he may prescribe, consent to the release of the mortgagor from his liability under the mortgage or the credit instrument secured thereby, or consent to the release of parts of the mortgaged property from the lien of the mortgage.

RULE 3

(a) A power-driven vessel when towing or pushing another vessel or seaplane shall, in addition to her sidelights, carry two bright white lights in a vertical line one over the other, not less than 6 feet apart, and when towing more than one vessel shall carry an additional bright white light 6 feet above or below such lights, if the length of the tow, measuring from the stern of the towing vessel to the stern of the last vessel or seaplane towed, exceeds 600 feet. Each of these lights shall be of the same construction and character and one of them shall be carried in the same position as the white light mentioned in Rule 2 (a) (i), except the additional light, which shall be carried at a height of not less than 14 feet above the hull. In a vessel with a single mast, such lights may be carried on the mast.
(b) The towing vessel shall also show either the stern light specified in Rule 10 or in lieu of that light a small white light abaft the funnel or aftermast for the tow to steer by, but such light shall not be visible forward of the beam. The carriage of the white light specified in Rule 2 (a) (ii) is optional.
(c) A seaplane on the water, when towing one or more seaplanes or vessels, shall carry the lights prescribed in Rule 2 (b) (i), (ii) and ( i i i ) ; and, in addition, she shall carry a second white light of the same construction and character as the white light mentioned in Rule 2 (b) (i), and in a vertical line at least 6 feet above or below such light.

RULE 4
(a) A vessel which is not under command shall carry, where they can best be seen, and, if a power-driven vessel, in lieu of the lights required by Rule 2 (a) (i) and (ii), two red lights in a vertical line one over the other not less than 6 feet apart, and of such a character as to be visible all round the horizon at a distance of at least 2 miles. By day, she shall carry in a vertical line one over the other not less than 6 feet apart, where they can best be seen, two black balls or shapes each not less than 2 feet in diameter.
(b) A seaplane on the water which is not under command may carry, where they can best be seen, two red lights in a vertical line, one over the other, not less than 3 feet apart, and of such a character as to be visible all round the horizon at a distance of at least 2 miles, and may by day carry in a vertical line one over the other not less than 3 feet apart, where they can best be seen, two black balls or shapes, each not less than 2 feet in diameter.
(c) A vessel engaged in laying or in picking up a submarine cable or navigation mark, or a vessel engaged in surveying or underwater operations when from the nature of her work she is unable to get out of the way of approaching vessels, shall carry, in lieu of the lights specified in Rule 2 (a) (i) and (ii), three lights in a vertical line one over the other not less than 6 feet apart. The highest and lowest of these lights shall be red, and the middle light shall be white, and they shall be of such a character as to be visible all round the horizon at a distance of at least 2 miles. By day, she shall carry in a vertical line one over the other not less than 6 feet apart, where they can best be seen, three shapes each not less than 2 feet in diameter, of which the highest and lowest shall be globular in shape and red in colour, and the middle one diamond in shape and white.
(d) The vessels and seaplanes referred to in this Rule, when not making way through the water, shall not carry the coloured sidelights, but when making way they shall carry them.

PUBLIC LAW 172--OCT. 11, 1951

411

(e) The lights and shapes required to be shown by this Rule are to be taken by other vessels and seaplanes as signals that the vessel or seaplane showing them is not under command and cannot therefore get out of the way.
(f) These signals are not signals of vessels in distress and requiring assistance. Such signals are contained in Rule 31.

RULE 5
(a) A sailing vessel under way and any vessel or seaplane being towed shall carry the same lights as are prescribed by Rule 2 for a power-driven vessel or a seaplane under way, respectively, with the exception of the white lights specified therein, which they shall never carry. They shall also carry stern lights as specified in Rule 10, provided that vessels towed, except the last vessel of a tow, may carry, in lieu of such stern light, a small white light as specified in Rule 3(b).
(b) A vessel being pushed ahead shall carry, at the forward end, on the starboard side a green light and on the port side a red light, which shall have the same characteristics as the lights described in Rule 2 (a) (iv) and (v) and shall be screened as provided in Rule 2 (a) (vi), provided that any number of vessels pushed ahead in a group shall be lighted as one vessel.

RULE 6
(a) I n small vessels, when it is not possible on account of bad weather or other sufficient cause to fix the green and red sidelights, these lights shall be kept at hand lighted and ready for immediate use, and shall, on the approach of or to other vessels, be exhibited on their respective sides in sufficient time to prevent collision, in such manner as to make them most visible, and so that the green light shall not be seen on the port side nor the red light on the starboard side, nor, if practicable, more than 2 points ( 2 2 ^ degrees) abaft the beam on their respective sides.
(b) To make the use of these portable lights more certain and easy, the lanterns containing them shall each be painted outside with the colour of the lights they respectively contain, and shall be provided with proper screens.
RULE 7
Power-driven vessels of less than 40 tons, vessels under oars or sails of less than 20 tons, and rowing boats, when under way shall not be required to carry the lights mentioned in Rule 2, but if they do not carry them they shall be provided with the following lights:--
(a) Power-driven vessels of less than 40 tons, except as provided in section (b), shall carry:--
(i) I n the forepart of the vessel, where it can best be seen, and at a height above the gunwale of not less than 9 feet, a bright white light constructed and fixed as prescribed in Rule 2 (a) (i) and of such a character as to be visible at a distance of at least 3 miles.
(ii) Green and red sidelights constructed and fixed as prescribed in Rule 2 (a) (iv) and ( v ) , and of such a character as to be visible at a distance of at least 1 mile, or a combined lantern showing a green light and a red light from right ahead to 2 points (221^ degrees) abaft the beam on their respective sides. Such lantern shall be carried not less than 3 feet below the white light.

412

PUBLIC LAW 172--OCT. 11, 1951

[65 STAT.

(b) Small power-driven boats, such as are carried by seagoing vessels, may carry the white light at a less height than 9 feet above the gunwale, but it shall be carried above the sidelights or the combined lantern mentioned in subsection (a) (ii).
(c) Vessels of less than 20 tons, under oars or sails, except as provided in section (d), shall, if they do not carry the sidelights, carry where it can best be seen a lantern showing a green light on one side and a red light on the other, of such a character as to be visible at a distance of at least 1 mile, and so fixed that the green light shall not be seen on the port side, nor the red light on the starboard side. Where it is not possible to fix this light, it shall be kept ready for immediate use and shall be exhibited in sufficient time to prevent collision and so that the green light shall not be seen on the port side nor the red light on the starboard side.
(d) Small rowing boats, whether under oars or sail, shall only be required to have ready at hand an electric torch or a lighted lantern showing a white light which shall be exhibited in sufficient time to prevent collision.
(e) The vessels and boats referred to in this Rule shall not be required to carry the lights or shapes prescribed in Rules 4 (a) and 11 (e).
RULE 8
(a) (i) Sailing pilot-vessels, when engaged on their station on pilotage duty and not at anchor, shall not show the lights prescribed for other vessels, but shall carry a white light at the masthead visible all round the horizon at a distance of at least 3 miles, and shall also exhibit a flare-up light or flare-up lights at short intervals, which shall never exceed 10 minutes.
(ii) On the near approach of or to other vessels they shall have their sidelights lighted ready for use and shall flash or show them at short intervals, to indicate the direction in which they are heading, but the green light shall not be shown on the port side, nor the red light on the starboard side.
(iii) A sailing pilot-vessel of such a class as to be obliged to go alongside of a vessel to put a pilot on board may show the white light instead of carrying it at the masthead and may, instead of the sidelights above mentioned, have at hand ready for use a lantern with a green glass on the one side and a red glass on the other to be used as prescribed above.
(b) A power-driven pilot-vessel when engaged on her station on pilotage duty and not at anchor shall, in addition to the lights and flares required for sailing pilot-vessels, carry at a distance of 8 feet below her white masthead light a red light visible all around the horizon at a distance of at least 3 miles, and also the sidelights required to be carried by vessels when under way. A bright intermittent all round white light may be used in place of a flare.
(c) All pilot-vessels, when engaged on their stations on pilotage duty and at anchor, shall carry the lights and show the flares prescribed in sections (a) and (b), except that the sidelights shall not be showm. They shall also carry the anchor light or lights prescribed in Rule 11.
(d) All pilot-vessels, whether at anchor or not at anchor, shall, when not engaged on their stations on pilotage duty, carry the same lights as other vessels of their class and tonnage.

Speed to be moderate in fog, &c.
(a) Every vessel, or seaplane when taxi-ing on the water, shall, in fog, mist, falling snow, heavy rainstorms or any other condition similarly restricting visibility, go at a moderate speed, having careful regard to the existing circumstances and conditions.
(b) A power-driven vessel hearing, apparently forward of her beam, the fog-signal of a vessel the position of which is not ascertained, shall, so far as the circumstances of the case admit, stop her engines, and then navigate with caution until danger of collision is over.

PART C--STEERING AND SAILING RULES

PRELIMINARY
1. In obeying and construing these Rules, any action taken should be positive, in ample time, and with due regard to the observance of good seamanship.
2. Risk of collision can, when circumstances permit, be ascertained by carefully watching the compass bearing of an approaching vessel. If the bearing does not appreciably change, such risk should be deemed to exist.
3. Mariners should bear in mind that seaplanes in the act of landing or taking off, or operating under adverse weather conditions, may be unable to change their intended action at the last moment.

RULE 17
When two sailing vessels are approaching one another, so as to involve risk of collision, one of them shall keep out of the way of the other, as follows:--
(a) A vessel which is running free shall keep out of the way of a vessel which is close-hauled.
(b) A vessel which is close-hauled on the port tack shall keep out of the way of a vessel which is close-hauled on the starboard tack.
(c) When both are running free, with the wind on different sides, the vessel which has the wind on the port side shall keep out of the way of the other.
(d) When both are running free, with the wind on the same side, the vessel which is to windward shall keep out of the way of the vessel which is to leeward.
(e) A vessel which has the wind aft shall keep out of the way of the other vessel.
RULE 18
(a) When two power-driven vessels are meeting end on, or nearly end on, so as to involve risk of collision, each shall alter her course to starboard, so that each may pass on the port side of the other. This Rule only applies to cases where vessels are meeting end on, or nearly end on, in such a manner as to involve risk of collision, and does not apply to two vessels which must, if both keep on their respective courses, pass clear of each other. The only cases to which it does apply are when each of two vessels is end on, or nearly end on, to the other; in other words, to cases in which, by day, each vessel sees the masts of the other in a line, or nearly in a line, with her own; and by night, to cases in which each vessel is in such a position as to see both the sidelights of the other. I t does not apply, by day, to cases in

418

PUBLIC LAW 172--OCT. 11, 1951

[65 STAT.

which a vessel sees another ahead crossing her own course; or, by night, to cases where the red light of one vessel is opposed to the red light of the other or where the green light of one vessel is opposed to the green light of the other or where a red light without a green light or a green light without a red light is seen ahead, or where both green and red lights are seen anywhere but ahead.
(b) For the purposes of this Rule and Rules 19 to 29 inclusive, except Rule 20 (b), a seaplane on the water shall be deemed to be a vessel, and the expression "power-driven vessel" shall be construed accordingly.
RUIiE 19
When two power-driven vessels are crossing, so as to involve risk of collision, the vessel which has the other on her own starboard side shall keep out of the way of the other.

RULE 20
(a) When a power-driven vessel and a sailing vessel are proceeding in such directions as to involve risk of collision, except as provided in Rules 24 and 26, the power-driven vessel shall keep out of the way of the sailing vessel.
(b) A seaplane on the water shall, in general, keep well clear of all vessels and avoid impeding their navigation. In circumstances, however, where risk of collision exists, she shall comply with these Rules.
RULE 21
Where by any of these Rules one of two vessels is to keep out of the way, the other shall keep her course and speed. When, from any cause, the latter vessel finds herself so close that collision cannot be avoided by the action of the giving-way vessel alone, she also shall take such action as will best aid to avert collision (see Rules 27 and 29).

RULE 22
Every vessel which is directed by these Rules to keep out of the way of another vessel shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, avoid crossing ahead of the other.
RULE 23
Every power-driven vessel which is directed by these Rules to keep out of the way of another vessel shall, on approaching her, if necessary, slacken her speed or stop or reverse.

RULE 24
(a) Notwithstanding anything contained in these Rules, every vessel overtaking any other shall keep out of the way of the overtaken vessel.
(b) Every vessel coming up with another vessel from any direction more than 2 points (221/2 degrees) abaft her beam, i. e. in such a position, with reference to the vessel which she is overtaking, that at night she would be unable to see either of that vessel's sidelights, shall be deemed to be an overtaking vessel; and no subsequent alteration of the bearing between the two vessels shall make the overtaking vessel a crossing vessel within the meaning of these Rules, or relieve her of the duty of keeping clear of the overtaken vessel until she is finally past and clear.

66 STAT.]

PUBLIC LAW 172--OCT. 11, 1951

419

(c) If the overtaking vessel cannot determine with certainty whether she is forward of or abaft this direction from the other vessel, she shall assume that she is an overtaking vessel and keep out of the way.
RULE 25
(a) In a narrow channel every power-driven vessel when proceeding along the course of the channel shall, when it is safe and practicable, keep to that side of the fairway or mid-channel which lies on the starboard side of such vessel.
(b) Whenever a power-driven vessel is nearing a bend in a channel where a power-driven vessel approaching from the other direction cannot be seen, such vessel, when she shall have arrived within onehalf mile of the bend, shall give a signal by one prolonged blast of her whistle, which signal shall be answered by a similar blast given by any approaching power-driven vessel that may be within hearing around the bend. Regardless of whether an approaching vessel on the farther side of the bend is heard, such bend shall be rounded with alertness and caution.
RULE 2 6
All vessels not engaged in fishing shall, when under way, keep out of the way of any vessels fishing with nets or lines or trawls. This Rule shall not give to any vessel engaged in fishing the right of obstructing a fairway used by vessels other than fishing; vessels.

RUIiE 27
In obeying and construing these Rules due regard shall be had to all dangers of navigation and collision, and to any special circumstances, including the limitations of the craft involved, which may render a departure from the above Rules necessary in order to avoid immediate danger.
PART D.--MISCELLANEOUS

RULE 28
(a) When vessels are in sight of one another, a power-driven vessel under way, in taking any course authorised or required by these Rules, shall indicate that course by the following signals on her whistle, namely:--
One short blast to mean "I am altering my course to starboard." Two short blasts to mean "I am altering my course to port." Three short blasts to mean "My engines are going astern." (b) Whenever a power-driven vessel which, under these Rules, is to keep her course and speed, is in sight of another vessel and is in doubt whether sufficient action is being taken by the other vessel to avert collision, she may indicate such doubt by giving at least five short and rapid blasts on the whistle. The giving of such a signal shall not relieve a vessel of her obligations under Rules 27 and 29 or any other Rule, or of her duty to indicate any action taken under these Rules by giving the appropriate sound signals laid down in this Rule. (c) Nothing in these Rules shall interfere with the operation of any special rules made by the Government of any nation with respect to the use of additional whistle signals between ships of war or vessels sailing under convoy.
RULE 29
Nothing in these Rules shall exonerate any vessel, or the owner, master or crew thereof, from the consequences of any neglect to carry

420

PUBLIC LAW 173--OCT. 12, 1961

[65 STAT.

lights or signals, or of any neglect to keep a proper look-out, or of the neglect of any precaution which may be required by the ordinary practice of seamen, or by the special circumstances of the case.

RULE 30

Reservation of Rules for Harbours and Inland Navigation

Nothing in these Rules shall interfere with the operation of a special rule duly made by local authority relative to the navigation of any harbour, river, lake, or inland water, including a reserved seaplane area.
RULE 31

Distress Signals

When a vessel or seaplane on the water is in distress and requires

assistance from other vessels or from the shore, the following shall be

the signals to be used or displayed by her, either together or separately,

namely:--

(a) A gun or other explosive signal fired at intervals of about a

minute.

· (b) A continuous sounding with any fog-signal apparatus.

(c) Rockets or shells, throwing red stars fired one at a time at short

intervals.

(d) A signal made by radiotelegraphy or by any other signalling

method consisting of the group . . .

. . . in the Morse Code.

(e) A signal sent by radiotelephony consisting of the spoken word

"Mayday."

(f) The International Code Signal of distress indicated by N.C.

(g) A signal consisting of a square flag having above or below it a

ball or anything resembling a ball.

(h) Flames on the vessel (as from a burning tar barrel, oil barrel,

&c.).

(i) A rocket parachute flare showing a red light.

The use of any of the above signals, except for the purpose of

indicating that a vessel or a seaplane is in distress, and the use of any

signals which may be confused with any of the above signals, is

prohibited.

Note.--A radio signal has been provided for use by vessels in distress

for the purpose of actuating the auto-alarms of other vessels and thus

securing attention to distress calls or messages. The signal consists

of a series of twelve dashes, sent in 1 minute, the duration of each dash

being 4 seconds, and the duration of the interval between two consecu-

tive dashes 1 second.

RULE 32

All orders to helmsmen shall be given in the following sense: right rudder or starboard to mean "put the vessel's rudder to starboard"; left rudder or port to mean "put the vessel's rudder to port."

F o r the purpose of this paragraph, in the case of the recovery of the same property or interest considered under subsection (a) as destroyed or seized, the fair market value of such property or interest shall, at the option of the taxpayer, be considered an amount equal to the adjusted basis (for determining loss) of such property or interest in the hands of the taxpayer on the date such property or interest was considered under subsection (a) as destroyed or seized. The amount of the recovery determined under this subparagraph shall be reduced for the purposes of subparagraphs (B) and (C) by the amount of the obligations or liabilities with respect to the property considered under subsection (a) as destroyed or seized in respect of which the recovery was received, if the taxpayer for any previous taxable year chose under subsection (b) (2) to treat such obligations or liabilities as discharged or satisfied out of such property, and such obligations or liabilities were not so discharged or satisfied prior to the date of the recovery.

Such increase in the tax for each such year so resulting shall be computed in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary. Such regulations shall give effect to previous recoveries of any kind (including recoveries described in section 22 (b) (12)) with respect to any prior year, and shall provide for the case where there was no tax for the prior year, but shall otherwise treat the tax previously determined for any year in accordance with the principles set forth in section 3801 ( d ) . All credits allowable against the tax for any year and all carry-overs and carry-backs affected by so decreasing the allowable deductions shall be taken into account in computing the increase in the tax, except that the computation of the excess profits credit under chapter 2 E for any taxable year shall not be affected.

TITLE I--^WAR MATERIALS

SEC. 101. The Congress of the United States, recognizing that in a world threatened by aggression the United States can best preserve and maintain peace by developing maximum national strength and by utilizing all of its resources in cooperation with other free nations, hereby declares it to be the policy of the United States to apply an embargo on the shipment of arms, ammunition, and implements of war, atomic energy materials, petroleum, transportation materials of strategic value, and items of primary strategic significance used in the production of arms, ammunition, and implements of war to any nation or combination of nations threatening the security of the United States, including the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and all countries under its domination, in order to (1) increase the national strength of the United States and of the cooperating nations; (2) impede the ability of nations threatening the security of the United States to conduct military operations; and (3) to assist the people of the nations under the domination of foreign aggressors to reestablish their freedom.
I t is further declared to be the policy of the United States that no military, economic, or financial assistance shall be supplied to any nation unless it applies an embargo on such shipments to any nation or combination of nations threatening the security of the United States, including the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and all countries under its domination.
This Act shall be administered in such a way as to bring about the fullest support for any resolution of the General Assembly of the United Nations, supported by the United States, to prevent the shipment of certain commodities to areas under the control of governments engaged in hostilities in defiance of the United Nations.
SEC. 102. Responsibility for giving effect to the purposes of this Act shall be vested in the person occupying the senior position authorized by subsection (e) of section 406 of the Mutual Defense Assistance Act of 1949, as amended, or in any person who may hereafter be charged with principal responsibility for the administration of the provisions of the Mutual Defense Assistance Act of 1949. Such person is hereinafter referred to as the "Administrator".
SEO. 103. (a) The Administrator is hereby authorized and directed to determine within thirty days after enactment of this Act after full and complete consideration of the views of the Departments of State, Defense, and Commerce; the Economic Cooperation Administration; and any other appropriate agencies, and notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, which items are, for the purpose of this Act, arms, ammunition, and implements of war, atomic energy materials, petroleum, transportation materials of strategic value, and those items of primary strategic significance used in the production of arms, ammunition, and implements of war which should be embargoed to effectuate the purposes of this Act: Provided^ That such determinations shall be continuously adjusted to current conditions on the basis of investigation and consultation, and that all nations receiving United States military, economic, or financial assistance shall be kept informed of such determinations.
(b) All military, economic, or financial assistance to any nation shall, upon the recommendation of the Administrator, be terminated forthwith if such nation after sixty days from the date of a determination under section 103 (a) knowingly permits the shipment to any nation or combination of nations threatening the security of the United States, including the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and all countries under its domination, of any item which he has determined under section 103 (a) after a full and complete investigation to be

T h a t the President shall immediately report any determination made pursuant to the first proviso of this section with reasons therefor to the Appropriations and Armed Services Committees of the Senate and of the House of Representatives, the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate, and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives, and the President shall at least once each quarter review all determinations made previously and shall report his conclusions to the foregoing committees of the House and Senate, which reports shall contain an analysis of the trade with the Soviet bloc of countries for which determinations have been made.
SEC. 104.

SEC. 202. The United States shall negotiate with any country receiving military, economic, or financial assistance arrangements for the recipient country to undertake a program for controlling exports of items not subject to embargo under title I of this Act, but which in the judgment of the Administrator should be controlled to any nation or combination of nations threatening the security of the United States, including the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and all countries under its domination.
SEC. 203. All military, economic, and financial assistance shall be terminated when the President determines that the recipient country (1) is not effectively cooperating with the United States pursuant to this title, or (2) is failing to furnish to the United States information

"(2) CONVERSION INTO MONEY WHERE DISPOSITION OCCURRED
PRIOR TO 1951.--Into money, and the disposition of the converted property occurred before Januai-y 1, 1951, no gain shall be recognized if such money is forthwith in good faith, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, expended in the acquisition of other property similar or related in service or use to the property so converted, or in the acquisition of control of a corporation owning such other property, or in the establishment of a replacement fund.

"(i) no property or stock acquired before the disposition of the converted property shall be considered to have been acquired for the purpose of replacing such converted property unless held by the taxpayer on the date of such disposition; and
"(ii) the taxpayer shall be considered to have purchased property or stock only if, but for the provisions
of sectiou 113 (a) ( 9 ) , the unadjusted basis of such prop-

ENLARGING THE MUIR WOODS NATIONAL MONUMENT, CALIFORNIA
BY THE PRESIDENT OF T H E UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
A PROCLAMATION
WHEREAS the Muir Woods National Monument, California, was established by Proclamation No. 793 of January 9, 1908 (35 Stat. 2174), and was enlarged by Proclamations No. 1608 of September 22, 1921 (42 Stat. 2249), and No. 2122 of April 5, 1935 (49 Stat. 3443), to protect a most extraordinary growth of redwood trees (Sequoia Sempervirens) of primeval character; and
W H E R E A S the said monument is comprised of various parcels of land conveyed to the United States, as donations, from time to time for national-monument purposes, as separately described and set out in the above-mentioned proclamations; and
W H E R E A S the William Kent Estate Company, a corporation of the State of California, has conveyed to the United States, as a donation, a tract of land adjoining the southwesterly boundary of the monument to afford better protection to the monument and to promote its administration and development; and
W H E R E A S the United States has acquired from the State of California a leasehold interest in a tract of land adjoining the southeasterly boundary of the monument to afford better protection to the monument and to promote its administration and development; and
W H E R E A S there lies at the entrance to the monument a tract of land belonging to the William Kent Estate Company which is needed for additional visitor parking space and for other purposes incident to the proper development and administration of the monument and which is in process of acquisition by the United States for such purposes; and
W H E R E A S it appears that it would be in the public interest (1) to enlarge the Muir Woods National Monument by adding thereto the said tract of land donated to the United States by the William Kent Estate Company and the said tract of land leased to the United States by the State of California, (2) to extend the boundaries of the monument so as to include therein such additional lands and the said tract of land owned by the William Kent Estate Company, and (3) to provide that the last-mentioned tract of land shall become a part of the monument upon acquisition of title thereto or control thereof by the United States:

W H E R E A S pursuant to section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933 as amended by section 31 of the act of August 24, 1935, 49 Stat. 750,773, as amended by section 5 of the act of February 29, 1936, 49 Stat. 1148, 1152, and as reenacted by section 1 of the act of J u n e 3, 1937, 50 Stat. 246 (7 U. S. C. 624), the President issued a proclamation on September 5, 1939 (No. 2351, 54 Stat. 2640), limiting the quantities of certain cotton and cotton waste which might be entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption, which proclamation was suspended in part or modified by the President's proclamations of December 19, 1940 (No. 2450, 54 Stat. 2769), March 31, 1942 (No. 2544, 56 Stat. 1944), J u n e 29, 1942 (No. 2560, 56 Stat. 1963), February 1, 1947 (No. 2715, 61 Stat. 1049), June 9, 1947 (No. 2734, 61 Stat. 1071), J u l y 20, 1948 (No. 2800, 62 Stat. 1534), September 3, 1949 (No. 2856, 63 Stat. 1294), October 4, 1950 (No. 2905, 15 F .

W H E R E A S the said proclamation of September 5, 1939, as suspended in part and modified, provides that the total quantity of cotton having a staple of 1% inches or more but less than l^Vie inches in length which may be entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption in any year commencing February 1 shall not exceed 45,656,420 pounds; and
W H E R E A S the limitation on the entry of cotton having a staple of 1% inches or more in length was imposed by the said proclamation of September 5, 1939 after a finding by the President, on the basis of an investigation and report of the United States Tariff Commission made under the provisions of the said section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, as amended, that such cotton was being imported into the United States under such conditions and in sufficient quantities as to tend to render ineffective or materially interfere with the program undertaken with respect to cotton under the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act, as amended; and
W H E R E A S the imposition of annual quotas on cotton having a staple of \y^ inches or more in length was recommended by the United States Tariff Commission in its report (Report No. 137, 2d Series) in connection with which it was stated, in finding No. 5, that the quotas recommended "will prevent imports from interfering with the cotton program and at the same time will permit American industry to secure needed supplies of specialized types of cotton"; and

W H E R E A S in the course of the said supplemental investigation, after due notice, a public hearing was held on J u n e 13, 1951, at which parties interested were given opportunity to be present, to produce evidence, and to be heard, and, in addition to the hearing, the Commission made such investigation as it deemed necessary for a full disclosure and presentation of the facts; and
W H E R E A S the Commission has made findings of fact and has transmitted to me a report of such findings and its recommendations based thereon, together with a transcript of the evidence submitted at the hearing, and has also transmitted a copy of such report to the Secretary of Agriculture; and
W H E R E A S the Commission has recommended that an additional quantity of 1,500,000 pounds of harsh or rough cotton (except cotton of perished staple, grabbots, and cotton pickings), white in color, and having a staple of 1%Q inches or more but less than 1% inches in length be permitted entry during the quota year ending at the close of January 31, 1962, in order to enable domestic users to obtain their essential requirements for such cotton:
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, H A R R Y S. TRUMAN, President of the United States of America, do hereby find and declare, on the basis of the said supplemental investigation and report of the United States Tariff Commission, that changed circumstances require the modification of the said proclamation of September 5, 1939, as suspended in part and modified, so as to permit the entry for consumption, or withdrawal from warehouse for consumption, during the quota year ending at the close of January 31, 1952, of 1,500,000 pounds of harsh or rough cotton (except cotton of perished staple, grabbots, and cotton pickings), white in color, and having a staple of 1%6 inches or more but less than 1% inches in length, in addition to the quantity of cotton having a staple of 1% inches or more but less than lii/ie inches in length the entry of which has already been made during the said quota year under the said proclamation of September 5, 1939, as suspended in part and modified, which additional quantity I find should be permitted entry to carry out the purposes of section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, as amended. Accordingly, pursuant to the said section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, as amended, I hereby modify the said proclamation of September 5, 1939, so as to permit during the quota year ending at the close of January 31, 1952, the entry for consumption, or withdrawal from warehouse for consumption, of an additional quantity of 1,500,000

W H E R E A S an important element in determining when it may be practicable to apply these provisions to particular articles is the ability to do so consistently with the international obligations of the United States;
W H E R E A S , in giving effect to the procedures available to free the United States from international obligations existing with respect to some of the nations and areas covered by the above provisions, it will not be practicable to apply such provisions to all such nations and areas at the same time;

4. W H E R E A S it has been determined in accordance with paragraph 2 (c) (ii) of the said exclusive trade agreement that ginger root, candied, or otherwise prepared or preserved, was imported into the territory of the United States as a product of Cuba in some quantity during the calendar years 1937, 1939, 1944, or 1945;
5. W H E R E A S the most-favored-nation rate for ginger root, candied, or otherwise prepared or preserved, existing on April 10,1947, was 10 per centum ad valorem, which rate was established by the proclamation of June 29, 1942, mentioned in the first recital hereof, and the preferential rate likewise existing on that date with respect to such ginger root, the product of Cuba, was 8 per centum ad valorem, wherefore the absolute difference between this most-favored-nation rate and this preferential rate was 2 per centum ad valorem;
6. W H E R E A S the termination of the said proclamation of June 29, 1942, pursuant to the notes exchanged between the Government of the United States and the Government of the Republic of Peru mentioned in the second recital hereof, will result in the reestablishment as the most-favored-nation rate on ginger root, candied, or otherwise prepared or preserved, the rate of 20 per centum ad valorem provided for in paragraph 778 of the Tariff Act of 1930, and following such termination the rate of duty for such ginger root, the product of Cuba, conforming to the provisions of paragraph 2 (c) (ii) of the said exclusive trade agreement with Cuba will be 18 per centum ad valorem; and
7. W H E R E A S I determine that the application of such rate of 18 per centum ad valorem to ginger root, candied, or otherwise prepared or preserved, the product of Cuba, on and after October 7,1951, is required or appropriate to carry out the said exclusive trade agreement with Cuba:
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, H A R R Y S. TRUMAN, President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the statutes, including the said section 350 (a) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, do proclaim as follows:

"Whenever the President shall by proclamation declare an emergency to exist by reason of a state of war, or otherwise, he may authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to extend during the continuance of such emergency the time herein prescribed for the performance of any act . . ."; AND W H E R E A S by Proclamation No. 2914 of December 16,1950,

(1) T o extend the one-year period prescribed in section 491, supra^ as amended, for not more than one year from and after the expiration of such one-year period in any case in which such period has already expired or shall hereafter expire during the continuance of the said national emergency;
(2) To extend the three-year period prescribed in sections 557 and 559, supra^ as amended, for not more than one year from and after the expiration of such three-year period in any case in which such period has already expired or shall hereafter expire during the continuance of the said national emergency; and

(3) To extend further the one-year period prescribed in section 491, supra, as amended, and the three-year period prescribed in sections 657 and 559, supra, as amended, for additional periods of not more than one year each from and after the expiration of the immediately preceding extension in any case in which such extension shall expire during the continuance of the said national emergency:
Provided, however, that in each and every case under numbered paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) above in which the merchandise is charged against an entry bond the Secretary of the Treasury shall require that the principal on such bond, in order to obtain the benefit of any extension which may be granted under the authority of this proclamation, shall furnish to the collector of customs at the port where the bond is on file either the agreement of the sureties on the bond to remain bound under the terms and conditions of the bond to the same extent as if no extension had been granted, or an additional bond with acceptable sureties to cover the period of extension; and that, in each and every case in which the merchandise remains charged against a carrier's bond the Secretary of the Treasury shall require that the principal on such bond shall agree to the extension and shall furnish to the collector of customs at the port where the charge was made the agreement of the sureties on the bond to remain bound under the terms and conditions of the bond to the same extent as if no extension had been granted; and

Provided further, that as a condition to the granting of any extension or further extension of the periods prescribed in sections 491, 557, and 559 of the Tariff Act of 1930, supra, as amended, under numbered paragraphs (1), (2), or (3) above the Secretary of the Treasury may require that there shall be furnished to the collector of customs in the district in which the warehouse is located, in connection with the application for such extension, the consent of the warehouse proprietor to such extension or, in the alternative, proof of payment of all charges or amounts due or owing to such warehouse proprietor for the storage or handling of the imported merchandise; and
Provided further, that the extensions of one year authorized by this proclamation shall not apply to any case in which the period sought to be extended expired prior to December 16, 1950, or in which the merchandise in question has been sold by the Government as abandoned.
This proclamation supersedes Proclamation No. 2599 of November 4, 1943, as amended by Proclamation No. 2712 of December 3, 1946, but it shall not be construed (1) as invalidating any action heretofore taken under the provisions of the said Proclamation No. 2599 or under the provisions of that proclamation as amended by the said Proclamation No. 2712 or (2) as imposing the conditions set forth in the second proviso above upon the granting of extensions for which applications are pending on the date of this proclamation.
