Land titles in Missouri:-- The state of Missouri was formerly part of the territory, first of France, next of Spain, then of France, who ceded it to the United States by the treaty of 1803, in full propriety, sovereignty and dominion, as she had acquired and held it; by which this government put itself in place of the former sovereigns, and became invested with all their rights, subject to their concomitant obligations to the inhabitants. Both were regulated by the law of nations, according to which the rights of property are protected, even in the case of a conquered country, and held sacred and inviolable when it is ceded by treaty, with or without any stipulation to such effect; and the laws, whether in writing, or evidenced by the usage and customs of the conquered or ceded country, continue in force, until altered by the new sovereign. Strother v. Lucas, 12 Peters, 410. No principle can be better established by the authority of the supreme court, than "that the acts of an officer, to whom a public duty is assigned by his king, within the sphere of that duty, are prima facie taken to be within his power." The principles on which it rests, are believed to be too deeply founded in law and reason, ever to be successfully assailed. He who would controvert a grant executed by the lawful authority, with all the solemnities required by law, takes on himself the burthen of showing that the officer has transcended the powers conferred upon him ; or that the transaction is tainted with fraud.

Land titles in Missouri:-- The state of Missouri was formerly part of the territory, first of France, next of Spain, then of France, who ceded it to the United States by the treaty of 1803, in full propriety, sovereignty and dominion, as she had acquired and held it; by which this government put itself in place of the former sovereigns, and became invested with all their rights, subject to their concomitant obligations to the inhabitants. Both were regulated by the law of nations, according to which the rights of property are protected, even in the case of a conquered country, and held sacred and inviolable when it is ceded by treaty, with or without any stipulation to such effect; and the laws, whether in writing, or evidenced by the usage and customs of the conquered or ceded country, continue in force, until altered by the new sovereign. Strother v. Lucas, 12 Peters, 410. No principle can be better established by the authority of the supreme court, than "that the acts of an officer, to whom a public duty is assigned by his king, within the sphere of that duty, are prima facie taken to be within his power." The principles on which it rests, are believed to be too deeply founded in law and reason, ever to be successfully assailed. He who would controvert a grant executed by the lawful authority, with all the solemnities required by law, takes on himself the burthen of showing that the officer has transcended the powers conferred upon him ; or that the transaction is tainted with fraud.

sons who had filed a notice of claim to any tract of land lying within the district of Louisiana (now territory of Missouri) with the recorder of land titles, according to law, and have not exhibited any testimony or written evidence in support of the same, and whose claim has not already

Further time allowed to claimants within the district of Missouri.

Where the act of an officer to pass the title to land according to the Spanish law, is done contrary to

the written order of the king, is produced at the trial, without any explanation, it shall be presumed that

the power has not been exceeded : that the act was done on the motive set out therein ; and according

to some order known to the king and his officers, though not to his subjects : and courts ought to require

very full proof, that he had transcended his powers, before they so determine it. Ibid.

In favour of long possession and ancient appropriation, every thing which was done shall be presumed

to have been rightfully done; and though it does not appear to have been done, the law will presume

that whatever was necessary has been done. Ibid.

t

The stipulations of the treaty ceding Louisiana to the United States, affording that protection or secu-

rity to claims under the French or Spanish government to which the act of Congress refers, are in the

first, second and third articles. They extended to all property until Louisiana became a member of the

Union; into which the inhabitants were to be incorporated as soon as possible, "and admitted to all the

rights, advantages and immunities of citizens of the United States." The perfect inviolability and secu-

rity of property is among these rights. Delassus t>. The United States, 9 Peters, 117.

The right of property is protected and secured by the treaty, and no principle is better settled in this

country, than that an inchoate title to lands is property. This right would have been sacred, independ-

ent of the treaty. The sovereign who acquires an inhabited country, acquires full dominion over it;

but this dominion is never supposed to divest the vested rights of individuals to property. The language

of the treaty ceding Louisiana, excludes any idea of interfering with private property. Ibid.

On the 18th of April, 1802, the lieutenant-governor of Upper Louisiana granted sixteen hundred arpents

of land near certain rivers named in the grant, with directions to survey the same in a vacant place of the

royal domain; but no survey was made before the cession of Louisiana to the United States. By the

Court--As the grant contained no description of the land granted, and was not located within the time

prescribed by the act of Congress of the 10th of March, 1804, it comes directly within the point decided

by the supreme court in the case of John Smith, T., and cannot be confirmed. Wherry v. The United

States, 10 Peters, 338.

In repeated decisions, the supreme court have affirmed the authority of local governors, under the crown of Spain, to grant land in Louisiana, before the same was ceded by Spain to France: and the court have also affirmed the validity of descriptive grants, though not surveyed before the 11th of March, 1804, in Missouri, and the 24th of January, 1818, in Florida. Mackey v. The United States, 10 Peters,

A grant or concession made by an officer who is by law authorized to make it, carries with it prima facie evidence that it is within his powers. No excess of them, or departure from them, is to be presumed. He violates his duty by such excess, and is responsible for it. He who alleges that an officer entrusted with an important duty has violated his instructions, must show it. Delassus r. The United States, 9 Peters, 117.
The instructions of governor O'Reilly, relative to granting lands in Louisiana, were considered by the court, in 8 Peters, 455. These regulations, were intended for the general government of subordinate officers, and not to control and limit the power of the person from whose will they emanated. The Baron De Carondelet must be supposed to have had all the powers which had been vested in Don O'Reilly; and a concession ordered by him is as valid as a similar concession directed by governor O'Reilly would have been. Ibid.
A concession of land was made by the lieutenant-governor of Upper Louisiana, at the time when the power of granting lands was vested in the governors of provinces. This power was, in 1799, after the concession, transferred to the intendant-general; and after this transfer, in January, 1800, the order of survey of the land was made by the lieutenant-governor. The validity of the order of survey depends on the authority of the lieutenant-governor to make it. The lieutenant-governor was also a sub-delegate, and as such was empowered to make inchoate grants. The grant was confirmed. Chouteau's heirs v. The United States, 9 Peters, 137.
The transfer of the power to make concessions of lands belonging to the royal domain of Spain, from the governor-general to the intendant-general, did not affect the power of the sub-delegate, who made this concession. The order in this case is the foundation of title, and is, according to the act of Congress on the subject of confirming titles to lands in Missouri, &c., and the general understanding and usage of Louisiana and Missouri, capable of being perfected into a complete title. It is property, capable of being alienated, of being subjected to debts : and is, as such, to be held as sacred and inviolate as other property. Ibid.
A concession of one league square of land, in Upper Louisiana, was made by Don Zenon Trudeau, the lieutenant-governor of that province, to Auguste Chouteau, and a decree made by him directing the surveyor-general of the province to put him in possession of the land, and to survey the same, in order to enable Chouteau to solicit a complete title thereto from the governor-general, who by the said decree was informed that the circumstances of Chouteau were such as entitled him to a grant of the land. The land was surveyed, and the grantee put in full possession of it on the 20th of December, 1803. He retained possession of it until his death. The objection to the validity of the concession was, that the petitioner had not as many tame cattle as the eighth regulation of governor 0'Reilly, governor-general of Louisiana, required. That regulation required that the applicant for a grant of a league square of land should make it appear that he is possessed of one hundred head of tame cattle, some horses and sheep, and two slaves to look after them, a proportion which shall always be observed for the grants, &c. By the Court--In the spirit of the decisions which have been heretofore made by the supreme court, and of the acts of confirmation passed by Congress, the fact that the applicant possessed the requisite amount of property to entitle him to the land he solicited, was submitted to the officer who decided on the application ; and he is not bound to prove it to the court, which passes on the validity of the grant. These incomplete titles were transferable, and the assignee might not possess the means of proving the exact number of cattle in possession of the petitioner when the concession was made. The grant was confirmed. Ibid. 147.

titles: Provided, that in no case shall the grant be for more land than was claimed by the party in his notice of claim, nor for more land than is contained within the acknowledged and ascertained boundaries of the
tract claimed. Sec . 5. And be it further enacted, That the principal deputy surveyor
for the said territory shall survey or cause to be surveyed, under the direction of the surveyor general, a tract of six hundred and forty acres of land, to each claimant of a donation tract, whose claim has been confirmed as aforesaid, except as provided by the last preceding section, where the quantity claimed by the party was less than six hundred and forty acres, and where the ascertained boundaries of the tract claimed does not include six hundred and forty acres, in which cases the survey

If the court can trust the information received on this subject, neither the governor nor the intendantgeneral has ever refused to perfect an incomplete title granted by a deputy governor or a sub-delegate.
Ibid. The regulation made by Don O'Reilly, as to the quantity of land to be granted to an individual, is not
that no individual shall receive grants for more than one league square, but that no grant shall exceed a league square. The words of the regulation do not forbid different grants to the same person ; and, so far as the court are informed, it has never been so construed. Ibid.

shall consist of unappropriated lands, and shall in every case contain the improved lands, by virtue of the settlement on and cultivation of which the claimant's right to a donation has been confirmed, and in all cases
where, by reason of adjacent prior claims, or the contiguity of the improvements of the persons entitled to donation grants, each claimant cannot obtain a tract of six hundred and forty acres, the vacant lands applicable to the object shall be divided between the claimants in such manner as shall appear to the principal deputy surveyor most equitable;
and whenever plats of the surveys shall have been returned by the principal deputy surveyor to the office of the recorder of land titles, it shall be the duty of the recorder to issue for each tract, according to the survey returned to him, a certificate in favour of the party to each person
entitled thereto, which shall be transmitted to the commissioner of the general land-office; and if it shall appear to the satisfaction of the said commissioner that such certificate was fairly obtained, according to the true intent and meaning of this act, then in that case patents shall be granted in like manner as is provided by law for other lands of the United States.
Sec . 6. And be it further enacted, That the said recorder of land titles, in addition to his salary as fixed by law, shall be allowed fifty cents on each claim which had been filed, and in support of which evidence

And if any fisherman, having engaged himself for a voyage or for the fishing season, in any fishing vessel, and signed an agreement therefor as aforesaid, shall thereafter and while such agreement remains in force and to be performed, desert or absent himself from such vessel without leave of the master or skipper thereof, or of the owner or his agent, such deserter shall be liable to the same penalties as deserting seamen or mariners are subject to in the merchant service, and may in the like manner, and upon the like complaint and proof, be apprehended and detained; and all costs of process and commitment, if paid by the master or owner, shall be deducted out of the share of fish, or proceeds of any fishing voyage to which such deserter had or shall become entitled.

tract shall be so made and signed for a fishing voyage or for the fishing season, and any fish which may have been caught on board such vessel during the same, shall be delivered to the owner or to his agent for cure, and shall be sold by said owner or agent, such vessel shall, for the term of six months after such sale, be liable and answerable for the skipper's and every other fisherman's share of such fish, and may be proceeded against in the same form and to the same effect as any other vessel is by law liable and may be proceeded against for the wages of seamen or mariners in the merchant service. And upon such process for the value of a share or shares of the proceeds of fish delivered and sold as aforesaid it shall be incumbent on the owner or his agent to produce a just account of the sales and division of such fish according to such agreement or contract; otherwise the said vessel shall be answerable upon such process for what may be the highest value of the share or shares demanded. But in all cases the owner of such vessel or his agent, appearing to answer to such process, may offer thereupon his account of general supplies made for such fishing voyage and of other supplies therefor made to either of the demandants, and shall be allowed to produce evidence thereof in answer to their demands respectively; and judgment shall be rendered upon such process for the respective balances which upon such an inquiry shall appear: Provided always, That when process shall be issued against any vessel liable as aforesaid, if the owner thereof, or his

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That from and after the last day of December next, there shall be levied, collected, and paid the following yearly rates and duties upon all carriages for the conveyance of persons, which shall be kept by or for any person, for his or her own use, or to be let out for hire, or for the conveyance of passengers, to wit: for and upon every coach, the yearly sum of twenty dollars; for and upon every chariot and postchaise, the yearly sum of seventeen dollars; for and upon every phaeton and on every coachee having pannel work in the upper division thereof, the yearly sum of ten dollars; for and upon every other four wheel carriage hanging on steel or iron springs, the yearly sum of seven dollars; for and upon every four wheel carriage hanging upon wooden springs and on every two wheel carriage hanging on steel or iron springs, the yearly sum of four dollars ; and for and upon every other four or two wheel carriage the yearly sum of two dollars: Provided always, That nothing herein contained shall be construed to charge with a duty, any carriage usually and chiefly employed in husbandry, or for the transportation or carrying of goods, wares, merchandise, produce, or commodities.
Sec . 2. And be it further enacted, That the duties aforesaid shall be levied and collected upon all carriages usually and chiefly employed for the conveyance of persons, by whatever name or description the same have been or shall hereafter be known and called.

Cha p. XIV.--An Act concerning suits and costs in courts of the United States (a)
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That whenever there shall be several actions or processes against persons who might legally be joined in one action or process, touching any demand or matter in dispute before a court of the United States or of the territories thereof,

July 22, 1813.
When several actions are brought against persons who might be legally

(a) Decisions in the Courts of the United States, on the law of Costs.

1. The cost of printing a statement of the case for the Supreme Court, was refused to be allowed as
part of the plaintiff's costs. Jennings et al. Plaintiffs in Error v. The Brig Perseverance, 3 Dall. 336 ;

1 Cond. Rep. 154. 2. On a writ of error to the High Court of Appeals of Maryland, the judgment of that court was
reversed, and the judgment of the general court of Maryland was affirmed. The mandate of the Supreme Court was directed to the general court, and the costs of the Supreme Court and of the courts
of Maryland were allowed to the plaintiff in error. Clarke, Plaintiff in Error v. Harwood, 3 Dall.

342 ; 1 Cond. Rep. 157.
3. Costs are not to be awarded against the United States. The United States v. Hooe et al. 3 Cranch,

73 ; 1 Cond. Rep. 458. 4. A judgment for costs, generally, includes all the costs belonging to the suit, whether prior or
subsequent to the rendition of the judgment. If new costs accrue, the judgment opens to receive them.

Peyton v. Brooke, 3 Cranch, 92; 1 Cond. Rep. 464.

....

..

5. Costs were allowed upon the dismission of a writ of error for want of jurisdiction ; the original

defendant being also defendant in error. Winchester v. Jackson et. al. 3 Cranch, 514 ; 1 Cond. Rep. 612.

6. Where there appeared some ground for the prosecution, costs were refused. The United States

v. La Vengeance, 3 Dall. 297 ; 1 Cond. Rep. 132.

7. Where a writ of error is dismissed in the Supreme Court for want of jurisdiction, costs are not

allowed. Inglee v. Coolidge, 2 Wheat. 363; 4 Cond. Rep. 155.

8. Each party is liable to the clerk of the Supreme Court for the fees due to him from each party,

respectively. Caldwell v. Jackson, 7 Cranch, 276 ; 2 Cond. Rep. 490.

9. A copy of the record is not a part of the taxable costs of suit, to be recovered by one party against

the other; but the party who requests the copy, must pay the clerk for it. Ibid.

10. It is undoubtedly a general rule, that no court can give a direct judgment against the United

States for costs, in a suit to which they are a party, either on behalf of any suitor, or any officer of the

government. But it by no means follows, from this, that they are not liable for their own costs. No

direct suit can be maintained against the United States. But when an action is brought by the United States, to recover money in the hands of a party, who has a legal claim against them for costs, it would

be a very rigid principle, to deny to him the right of setting up such claim in a court of justice, and

turn him round to an application to Congress. If the right of the party is fixed by the existing law, there can be no necessity for an application to Congress, except for the purpose of remedy. And no such necessity can exist, when this right can properly be set up by way of defence to a suit by the
United States. U. S. v. Ringgold et al. 8 Peters, 150. 11. The United States do not pay costs in any case. The U. S. v. Barker, 2 Wheat. 395; 4 Cond.

Rep. 181. 12. No judgment or decree can be rendered directly against the United States for costs and expenses.

The Antelope, 12 Wheat. 546 ; 6 Cond. Rep. 629.

.

14. The fees and compensation to the marshal, where the government is a party to the suit, and his

fees or compensation are chargeable to the United States, are to be paid out of the treasury, upon a
certificate of the amount, to be made by the court, or one of the judges. Ibid.
15. In cases of reversal, costs do not go of course; but in cases of affirmance they do. When a
judgment is reversed for want ofjurisdiction, it must be without costs. Montalet v. Murray, 4 Cranch,

46; 2 Cond. Rep. 19.

.

16. The court below, upon a mandamus, on reversal of its judgment, may award execution tor the

costs of the appellant in that court. Riddle et al. v. Mandeville et al. 6 Cranch, 86; 2 Cond. Rep. 307.

17. Where the court ordered the costs to be paid of a former ejectment brought by the plaintiffs in

the names of other persons, but for their use, before the plaintiff could prosecute a second suit in his own name for the same land ; this was not a judicial decision that the right of the plaintiffs in the first suit was the same with that of the plaintiffs in the second suit. It was perfectly consistent with the

justice of the case, that when the plaintiffs sued the same defendant in their own name for the same land, that they should reimburse him for the past costs to which they had subjected him, before they should be permitted to proceed further. Rules of this kind are granted by the court to meet the justice and exigencies of cases as they occur; not depending solely on the interest which those who are subjected to such rules may have in the subject matter of suits which they bring and prosecute in the names of others; but on a variety of circumstances, which, in the exercise of a sound discretion, may
furnish a proper ground for their interference. Henderson and Wife v. Griffin, 5 Peters, 151.
18. Where several claims had been filed by the district attorney, and, before any further proceed-
ings in the cause, Congress remitted the forfeiture, on the payment of duties, costs, and charges: Held,
that the district attorney of Massachusetts was entitled to seventeen dollars on each claim. The

Francis, 1 Gallis. C. C. R. 453. 19. In taxing the costs in prize causes, where there are several claims, some of which are disposed
of by a final decree of condemnation, while others are suspended by appeal, the practice is to tax the
costs and expenses which have accrued, specially, upon each claim so disposed of, as a separate charge
against the same, and to add thereto an average proportion of the general costs and expenses which

have accrued in reference to all the claims in the cause. The Hiram and the Hero, 2 Gallis. C. C. R. 60.

20. In prize causes, the allowance or denial of costs rests in the discretion of the court; and where

20
sued in one action, costs can only be recovered as in one.
Costs to be recovered only in one libel when that is sufficient.

THIRTEENTH CONGRESS. Ses s . I. Ch . 14. 1813.
if judgment be given for the party pursuing the same, such party shall not thereon recover the costs of more than one action or process,unless special cause for several actions or processes shall be satisfactorily shown on motion in open court.
Sec . 2. Be it further enacted, That whenever proceedings shall be had on several libels against any vessel and cargo which might legally be joined in one libel before a court of the United States or of the territo-

the capture, though made in good faith, is in law adjudged tortious, the claimant is entitled by the
general practice of the court to such costs as have necessarily arisen m the prosecution of his claim, unless he has been guilty of such misconduct as amounts to a forfeiture of such costs. The Ulpiano, 1

21.When a cause is removed from a state court to the circuit court, under the act of Congress the

plaintiff is entitled to recover his costs; although he obtains a verdict for less than five hundred dollars.

Ellis v. Jarvis, 3 Mason,.457.
22. If a witness, recognised for the defendant, is marked on the indictment, and sent to the grand jury by the district attorney, the United States, on the acquittal of the prisoner, must pay the witness

his costs. United States v. Coulter, C. C. U. S. of Pennsylvania, April, 1803.

23. It is within the discretion of the court to permit the defendant to file a new plea; but where the

effect of it would be to put the plaintiff out of court, and the cause was instituted in consequence ot the act of the defendant himself, and had been long at issue before the application was made, the court

would not permit it to be done, unless the defendant would pay not only- the costs incurred since the

filing of his first plea, but the whole costs of the action. Anonymous, 2 Wash. C. C. R. 270. 24. Where the plaintiff prevails in the action, the court will not, in the exercise of their discretion,

tax the costs against him, where he might naturally and fairly suppose he was entitled to recover more

than five hundred dollars. Cottle v. Payne, 3 Day, 289.
25. Costs and expenses are not matters positively limited by law, but are allowed m the exercise of a sound discretion of the court; and no appeal lies from a mere decree respecting costs and expenses.

Canter v. The American and Ocean Insurance Company, 3 Peters, 319.

both. Peyton v. Brooke, 3 Cranch, 92; 1 Cond. Rep. 464.

defendant be defendant in error. Winchester v. Jackson et al. 3 Cranch, 515 ; 1 Cond. Rep. bl2.

29. The Supreme Court has no jurisdiction in a case in which the judges of the circuit court have divided in opinion, upon a motion for a rule to show cause why the taxation of the costs of the mars a
on an execution should not be reversed. Bank of the United Statesy. Green and others, 6 Peters, 26.
30. The transcript of the record had been lodged by the plaintiffs in error with the clerk of the court on the 24th of October, 1835 ; who refused to file it or docket the cause, until the plaintiffs had given the fee bond in pursuance of the thirty-seventh rule of the court. The counsel for the plaintiffs in error

moved to have the transcript filed and docketed; alleging they had done all the law required to be done in order to bring the case before the Supreme Court. On the part of the defendant in error, h

counsel filed and read in open court certified copies of the writ of error, citation and appeal bond, and

of the judgment of the circuit court; and having stated that the plaintiffs m error had failed to have the

case docketed according to the thirtieth rule of the court, they moved to have the case docketed and

dismissed. The court overruled the motion to docket and dismiss the cause ; and also the motion to have the transcript filed, and the cause docketed without the fee bond being first given. These

motions were overruled on the 18th of January, 1836 ; and the court allowed the plaintiffs in error until the 1st day of March following to give to the clerk the fee bond: on the failure so to give the

same, the writ of error to be dismissed. Owings v. Tiernan, 10 Peters, 447.
31. If the court had jurisdiction of the cause, when the action was commenced the repeal of the law
which gave the jurisdiction, will not take away the plaintiff's right to costs. Walker v. Smith, 1 Wash.

32. Where three members of the bar enter their appearance for the defendant, to suits instituted

against him, and are all equally called upon, and act as the attorneys of the defendant no warrant of attorney having been given by the defendant to either - the attorneys' fee in the bill of costs is to be

equally divided among all who have acted in the case, and who have appeared to the suits. Hurst vDurnell,1WashC.C,R438.

33.Query. If in an action for the violation of a patent, the plaintiff recover five hundred dollars

damages, or the damages when trebled amount to that sum, the plaintiff is entitled to costs. Kn

34 The common law gave costs in no case ; and the statute of Gloucester gave them only where
damages were recoverable at common law. Ibid.
35 If the defendant do not demand security for costs within a reasonable time, it shall not be a ground for a continuance, that such security has not been given when the cause is called for trial.
Hawkins v. Wiltbank, 4 Wash. C. C. R. 285.
36 The clerk of the circuit court for the district of Pennsylvania cannot charge in the bill of costs anv compensation for the travel and attendance of the successful party, none such being allowed in the supremeP court of the state.

ries thereof, there shall not be allowed thereon more costs than on one libel, unless special cause for libelling the vessel and cargo severally shall be satisfactorily shown as aforesaid. And in proceedings on several libels or informations against any cargo or parts of cargo or merchandise seized as forfeited for the same cause, there shall not be allowed by the court more costs than would be lawful on one libel or information, whatever may be the number of owners or consignees therein concerned: but allowance may be made on one libel or information for the costs incidental to several claims: Provided, That in case of a claim of any vessel or other property seized on behalf of the United States and libelled or informed against as forfeited under any of the laws thereof, if judgment shall pass in favour of the claimant, he shall be entitled to the
same upon paying only his own costs. Sec . 3. And be it further enacted, That whenever causes of like
nature, or relative to the same question shall be pending before a court of the United States or of the territories thereof, it shall be lawful for the court to make such orders and rules concerning proceedings therein as may be conformable to the principles and usages belonging to courts for avoiding unnecessary costs or delay in the administration of justice, and accordingly causes may be consolidated as to the court shall appear reasonable. And if any attorney, proctor, or other person admitted to manage and conduct causes in a court of the United States or of the territories thereof, shall appear to have multiplied the proceedings in any cause before the court so as to increase costs unreasonably and vexatiously, such person may be required by order of court to satisfy any
excess of costs so incurred. Appr ov ed , July 22, 1813.

No more costa than on one libel or information for the same cause of forfeiture.
Proviso. On a claim of property libelled, if the property is restored, the claimant shall only pay his own costs.
Causes may be consolidated, to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.
Attorney or proctor to pay excess of costs if proceedings have been multiplied unreasonably.

After notice of trial, the defendant cannot move to put off the trial, until the costs of a former ejectment be paid, without notice that such a motion would be made ; nor can it prevail under any circumstances, if the costs be demanded on an ejectment, which had been decided in the state court.

Where the plaintiff, being a non-resident, has filed security for costs, conditioned to pay them, " if the plaintiff does not prosecute his suit to effect, and does not pay the costs of the suit," in case the plaintiff succeeds, the sureties are exonerated from the payment of any costs; but the plaintiff is responsible to the officers of the court for his own costs, and the court will enforce the payment of
them by attachment. Lessee of Bowne v. Arbuncle, 1 Peters' C. C. R. 234.
Supreme Court, January Term, 1838. Rule of Court No. 44.
In all cases, where any suit shall be dismissed in the Supreme Court, except where the dismissal shall be for want of jurisdiction, costs shall be allowed for the defendant in error, or appellee, as the
case may be, unless otherwise agreed by the parties. In all cases of affirmances of any judgment or decree in the Supreme Court, costs shall be allowed to
the defendant in error, or appellee, as the case may be, unless otherwise ordered by the court. In all cases of reversals of any judgment or decree in the Supreme Court, except where the reversal
shall be for want of jurisdiction, costs shall be allowed in the Supreme Court for the plaintiff in error, or appellant, as the case may be; unless otherwise ordered by the court.
Neither of the foregoing rules shall apply to cases where the United States are a party; but in such cases no costs shall be allowed in the Supreme Court for or against the United States.
When costs are allowed in the Supreme Court, it shall be the duty of the clerk to insert the amount thereof in the body of the mandate, or other proper process, sent to the court below; and annex to the same the bill of items taxed in detail.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That from and after the last day of December next, there shall be levied, collected, and paid the following yearly rates and duties upon all carriages for the conveyance of persons, which shall be kept by or for any person, for his or her own use, or to be let out for hire, or for the conveyance of passengers, to wit: for and upon every coach, the yearly sum of twenty dollars; for and upon every chariot and postchaise, the yearly sum of seventeen dollars; for and upon every phaeton and on every coachee having pannel work in the upper division thereof, the yearly sum of ten dollars; for and upon every other four wheel carriage hanging on steel or iron springs, the yearly sum of seven dollars; for and upon every four wheel carriage hanging upon wooden springs and on every two wheel carriage hanging on steel or iron springs, the yearly sum of four dollars ; and for and upon every other four or two wheel carriage the yearly sum of two dollars: Provided always, That nothing herein contained shall be construed to charge with a duty, any carriage usually and chiefly employed in husbandry, or for the transportation or carrying of goods, wares, merchandise, produce, or commodities.

and convenient places in each county within their respective districts,

and to give public notice at least ten days previous to such day, of the

time and place of such attendance, and to receive such entry, made in

the manner before directed, at such place, or at any other where he may

happen to be, within the said month of January, and on tender and pay-

ment being made of the duty or duties therein mentioned, to grant a

certificate for each and every carriage mentioned in such entry, therein

specifying the name of the owner, the description and denomination of

the carriage, and the sum paid, with the time when, and the period for

which such duty shall be so paid: And the forms of the certificates to

be so granted shall be prescribed by the Treasury Department; and

such certificates or the acknowledgments of the collector aforesaid by a

Provided nevertheless, That no certificate shall be deemed of validity

any longer than while the carriage for which the said certificate was

granted, is owned by the person mentioned in such certificate, unless

such certificate shall be produced to the collector by whom it was granted,

and an entry shall be thereon made, specifying the name of the then

owner of such carriage, and the time when he or she became possessed

of the same.

Sec . 4. And be it further enacted, That any and all persons who shall

commence the having or keeping of any carriage subject to duties after

the month of December, shall and may at any time during the month

in which they shall so commence the having or keeping of such carriage,

make like entry in manner before prescribed; and on payment of such

proportion of the duties laid by this act on such carriage, as the time at

which he shall commence the keeping of such carriage to the end of

the month of December then next ensuing shall bear to the whole year,

shall be entitled to and may demand like certificates, subject neverthe-

less, to the conditions before and hereinafter provided.

Sec . 5. And be it further enacted, That any person having or keeping

any carriage subject to duty, who shall make an untrue or defective

entry, to evade the whole or any part of the duty justly and truly payable

according to this act, shall lose the sum paid pursuant to such untrue or

defective entry; and where such untrue or defective entry hath been

made, or where no entry shall be made, or where there shall be a neglect

of payment after entry, such person shall moreover in addition thereto,

at any time thereafter, on personal application and demand, at the house,

dwelling, or usual place of abode of such person, by the proper collector,

be liable, and shall pay the duties by this act imposed, with a further

sum, for the benefit of such officer, of twenty-five per centum; which

duties, with the said addition, shall be collected by distress and sale of

the goods and chattels of the person by whom the same shall be due

and payable: Provided always, That such application and demand, shall

not be made until sixty days after the day on which any duty shall com-

days, the owner of the carriage shall be exempted from the payment of

the said sum of twenty-five per centum.

Sec . 6. And be it further enacted, That in all cases where any duty

shall be collected pursuant to this act, whether by distress or otherwise,

certificates shall be granted for each carriage in manner as before pre-

And the said duty shall be collected in the same manner, and under the same regulations as other duties laid on the importation of foreign goods, wares, and merchandise, into the United States; Provided, That drawback shall in no case be allowed, and the term of credit for the payment
of duties shall be nine months. Sec . 2. And be it further enacted, That on all pickled fish of the
fisheries of the United States, exported therefrom subsequent to the last day of December, one thousand eight hundred and fourteen, there shall be allowed and paid a bounty of twenty cents per barrel, to be paid by the collector of the district from which the same shall be so exported, without any deduction or abatement; Provided always, That in order to entitle the exporter or exporters of such pickled fish to the benefit of such bounty or allowance, the said exporter or exporters shall make entry with the collector and naval officer of the district from whence the said pickled fish are intended to be exported; and shall specify in such entry the names of the master and vessel in which, and the place where such fish are intended to be exported, together with the particular quantity; and proof shall be made to the satisfaction of the collector of the district from which such pickled fish are intended to be exported, and of the naval officer thereof, if any, that the same are of the fisheries of the United States; and no entry shall be received as aforesaid, of any pickled fish which have not been inspected and marked pursuant to the inspection laws of the respective states where inspection laws are in force, in regard to any pickled fish, and the casks containing such fish shall be branded with the words " for bounty," with the name of the inspector or packer, the species and quality of the fish contained therein, and the name of the port of exportation; and the collector of such district shall,
together with the naval officer, where there is one, grant an order or permit for an inspector to examine the pickled fish as expressed in such entry, and if they correspond therewith, and the said officer is fully satis-
fied that they are of the fisheries of the United States, to lade the same agreeably to such entry, on board the ship or vessel therein expressed; which lading shall be performed under the superintendence of the officer examining the same, who shall make returns of the quantity and quality

were charged in procuring the bounty allowed by law to such vessels; it was held that it must be satisfactorily proved by the United States, that the omission by the owners who did not take the oath was through fraud and deceit, and not through mistake, in order to render the vessel liable to forfeit-
ure. Ibid.
Where a certificate made by the agent of the owner of the particular times of the sailing and returning of a vessel engaged in the cod fisheries was discovered to be incorrect and false after the payment ofthe bounties, it was held that if the incorrectness and falsity were by mistake, there was no forfeit-
ure under the acts of 1813 and 1819, but if by fraud and deceit there was. Ibid.
By the act of February 18, 1793, no registered ship or vessel can, while she remains registered, engage in the whale fishery, but she must surrender her register, and be enrolled and licensed for the
fisheries. United States v. Rogers, 3 Sumner, C. C. R. 432.
The forfeiture of a fishing vessel, under the act of July 29,1813, for fraudulently obtaining the fishing bounty, does not attach on the improvident payment of the bounty to a vessel not entitled to it, but to the act of fraud and deceit in obtaining it. The Boat Swallow, Ware's D. C. R. 21.
If a vessel be in fact entitled to the bounty, and fraud and deceit are employed in obtaining it, she
will be subject to forfeiture. Ibid.
The forfeiture provided by the act of July 29, 1813, for fraudulently obtaining the bounty allowed to fishing vessels, attaches only when there are fraud and deceit in obtaining it. The Harriet, Ware's

is proved to be false, it is prima facie evidence, but not conclusive of fraud and deceit. The owner is
not precluded from showing that the errors of the certificate arose from an innocent mistake. Ibid.
If the errors in the certificate are proved to have arisen from mistake without fraud, the owner may, to avoid a forfeiture, show that the vessel was employed on other days than those named in the certifi-
cate. Ibid.

been made as above directed, shall make oath or affirmation, that the pickled fish expressed in such entry, and then actually laden on board
the ship or vessel as therein expressed, are truly and bona fide of the fisheries of the United States, that they are truly intended to be exported as therein specified, and are not intended to be relanded within the limits of the United States; and shall also give bond in double the amount of the bounty or allowance to be received, with one or more sureties to the satisfaction of the collector of the port or place from which the said pickled fish are intended to be exported, conditioned that the same shall be landed and left at some foreign port or place without the limits aforesaid ; which bonds shall be cancelled at the same periods and in like manner as is provided in respect to bonds given on the exportation of goods, wares, and merchandise, entitled to drawback of duties; Provided always, That the said bounty or allowance shall not be paid until at least six months after the exportation of such pickled fish, to be com-
puted from the date of the bond, and until the exporter or exporters thereof shall produce to the collector with whom such outward entry is made, such certificates or other satisfactory proof of the landing of the same as aforesaid, as is made necessary for cancelling the bonds given
on the exportation of goods entitled to drawback; And provided also, That the bounty or allowance as aforesaid, shall not be paid unless the
same shall amount to ten dollars at least upon each entry. Sec . 3. And be it further enacted, That no bounty, drawback, or
allowance, shall be made under the authority of this act, unless it shall be proved to the satisfaction of the collector that the pickled fish for which the bounty, drawback, or allowance, shall be claimed, was wholly
cured with foreign salt, and on which a duty shall have been secured or paid.
Sec . 4. And be it further enacted, That if any pickled fish shall be
falsely or fraudulently entered with intent to obtain the bounty or allowance on their exportation as here provided, when the said fish are not
entitled to the same, the said fish or the value thereof, to be recovered of the person making such false entry, shall be forfeited.
Sec . 5. And be it further enacted, That from and after the last day of December, one thousand eight hundred and fourteen, there shall be
paid on the last day of December, annually, to the owner of every vessel or his agent, by the collector of the district where such vessel may belong, that shall be qualified agreeably to law for carrying on the bank and other cod fisheries, and that shall actually have been employed therein at sea for the term of four months, at the least, of the fishing season next preceding, which season is accounted to be from the last day of February to the last day of November in every year, for each and every ton of such vessel's burthen according to her admeasurement as licensed or enrolled, if of twenty tons and not exceeding thirty tons, two dollars and forty cents; and if above thirty tons four dollars; of which allowance aforesaid three-eighth parts shall accrue and belong to the owner of such fishing vessel, and the other five-eighths thereof shall be divided by him, his agent, or lawful representative, to and among the several fishermen, who shall have been employed in such vessel during the season aforesaid, or a part thereof, as the case may be, in such proportions as the fish they shall respectively have taken may bear to the whole quantity of fish taken on board such vessel during such season : Provided, That the allowance
