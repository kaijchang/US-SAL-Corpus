CHAPTER 417

Providing for an objective, thorough, and nationwide analysis and reevaluation of the human and economic problems of mental illness, and for other purposes.

July 28^ 19SS [H. J. Res. 256]

Whereas some seven hundred and fifty thousand mentally ill and retarded patients are now being hospitalized on any given day; and
Whereas 47 per centum of the hospital beds in the Nation are occupied by mental patients; and
Whereas the direct economic cost of mental illness to the taxpayers of the Nation, including pensions to veterans with psychiatric disabilities, is over $1,000,000,000 a year and has been increasing at a rate of $100,000,000 a >^ear; and
Whereas the emotional impact and distress suffered by millions of our people anxiously and justifiably concerned about the welfare, treatment, and prospects of mentally afflicted relatives is incalculable and is one of the most urgent concerns of our people; and
Whereas the Governors of the several States, through national and regional Governors Conferences and through the publications of the Council of State Governments, have shown great initiative in their cooperative attempts to develop better methods of meeting the challenge of mental illness in their States; and
Whereas there is strong justification for believing that this constantly growing burden may well be due primarily to an outmoded reliance on simple custodial care in mental hospitals as the chief method of dealing with mental illness; and
Whereas there is strong reason to believe that lack of early intensive treatment facilities has created such a backlog of mentally deteriorated patients that it has become virtually impossible for the States to meet the need for mental hospital facilities; and
Whereas there is strong reason to believe that one of the greatest impediments to more rapid progress in the field of mental health is a definite shortage of professional personnel in all categories; and
Whereas there seems to be a discouraging lag between the discovery of new knowledge and skills in treating mental illness and their widespread application, as is evidenced by the fact that whereas only about one-third of newiy admitted mental patients are discharged from State hospitals in the course of a year, in a few outstanding institutions the recovery rate is 75 per centum or more; and
Whereas experience with certain community out-patient clinics and rehabilitation centers would seem to indicate that many mental patients could be better treated on an out-patient basis at much lower cost than by a hospital; and
Whereas there is strong reason to believe that a substantial proportion of public mental hospital facilities are being utilized for the care of elderly persons who could be better cared for and receive better treatment in modified facilities at lower cost; and
Whereas there is reason to believe that many emotionally disturbed children are being placed in mental hospitals, which have no proper facilities to administer to their needs; and

Whereas mental illness is frequently a component of sucii nationwide problems as alcoholism, drug addiction, juvenile delinquency, broken homes, school failures, absenteeism, and job maladjustment in industry, suicide, and similar problems; and
Whereas there seems to be no overall integrated body of knowledge concerning all aspects of the present status of our resources, methods, and practices for diagnosing, treating, caring for, and rehabilitating the mentally ill, although only through the development of such a body of knowledge can the people of the United States ascertain the true nature of this staggering problem and develop more effective plans to meet i t : Therefore be it
Resolved hy the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled^ That this joint resolution may be cited as the "Mental Health Study Act of 1955".

STATEMENT OF PURPOSES AND POLICY
SEC. 2. (a) I t is the sense of the Congress that there exists a critical need for such, an objective, thorough, and nationwide analysis and reevaluation of the human and economic problems of mental illness and of the resources, methods, and practices currently utilized in diagnosing, treating, caring for, and rehabilitating the mentally ill, both within and outside of institutions, as may lead to the development of comprehensive and realistic recommendations for such better utilization of those resources or such improvements on and new developments in methods of diagnosis, treatment, care, and rehabilitation as give promise of resulting in a marked reduction in the incidence or duration of mental illness and, in consequence, a lessening of the appalling emotional and financial drain on the families of those afflicted or on the economic resources of the States and of the Nation.
(b) I t is declared to be the policy of the Congress to promote mental health and to help solve the complex and the interrelated problems posed by mental illness by encouraging the undertaking of nongovernmental, multidisciplinary research into and reevaluation of all aspects of our resources, methods, and practices for diagnosing, treating, caring for, and rehabilitating the mentally ill, including research aimed at the prevention of mental illness. I t is the purpose of this joint resolution to implement that policy.

SPECIAL PROJECT GRANTS FOR COMPREHENSIVE MENTAL H E A L T H STUDY
SEC. 3. P a r t A of title I I I of the Public Health Service Act is amended by adding after section 303 the following new section :

" G R A N T S FOR SPECIAL PROJECTS IN MENTAL HEALTH
"SEC. 304. (a) (1) The Surgeon General is authorized, upon the recommendation of the National Advisory Mental Health Council, to make grants for the carrying out of a program of research into and study of our resources, methods, and practices for diagnosing, treating, caring for, and rehabilitating the mentally ill, such program to be on a scale commensurate with the problem.
"(2) Such grants may be made to one or more organizations, but only on condition that the organization will undertake and conduct, or if more than one organization is to receive such grants, only on condition that such organizations have agreed among themselves to undertake and conduct, a coordinated program of research into and study of all aspects of the resources, methods, and practices referred to in paragraph (1).

"(3) As used in paragraph (2), the term 'organization' means a nongovernmental agency, organization, or commission, composed of representatives of leading national medical and other professional associations, organizations, or agencies active in the field of mental health.
"(b) For such purpose there is hereby authorized to be appropriated for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1956, the sum of $250,000 to be used for a grant or grants to help initiate the research and study provided for in this section; and the sum of $500,000 for each of the two succeeding fiscal years for the making of such grants as may be needed to carry the research and study to completion. The terms of any such grant shall provide that the research and study shall be completed not later than three years from the date it is inaugurated; that the grantee shall file annual reports with the Congress, the Surgeon General, and the Governors of the several States, among others that the grantee may select; and that the final report shall be similarly filed.
"(c) Nothing in this section shall in any way affect the availability of amounts otherwise appropriated for work in the field of mental health; nor be construed to interfere with or diminish the more limited and specific programs of research and study being carried on through or under the auspices of the National Institute of Mental Health.
"(d) Any grantee agency, organization, or commission is authorized to accept additional financial support from private or other public sources to assist in carrying on the project authorized by this section."

Whereas these games will afford an opportunity of bringing together young men and women representing more than seventy nations, of many races, creeds, and stations in life and possessing various habits and customs, all bound by the universal appeal of friendly athletic competition, governed by rules of sportsmanship and dedicated to the principle that the important thing is for each and every participant to do his very best to win in a manner that will reflect credit upon himself or herself, and the country represented; and
Whereas the peoples of the world in these trynig times require above all else occasions for friendship and understanding, and among the most telling things which influence people of other countries are the acts of individuals and not those of governments; and

Whereas previous Olympic Games have proved that competitors and spectators alike have been imbued with ideals of friendship, chivalry, and comradeship and impressed with the fact that accomplishment is reward in itself; and
Whereas the United States Olympic Association is presently engaged in assuring maximum support for the teams representing the United States at Melbourne and Cortina d'Ampezzo; and
Whereas a day set aside by this Nation for a rededication to the amateur ideal could accomplish great good in encouraging good will for these games: Therefore be it

A u t h o r i t y of Board to determine positions, etc.

practice at least equivalent to those required of a teacher with a bachelor's degree; or
(3) involve activities which are so directly related to the educational process that the positions have characteristics of the educational field to a marked degree, even though academic credits in educational theory and practice are not required; or
(4) involve the management or direction or organizational units or school services which, though not directly involved in the educational process, require the incumbent to deal so extensively with employees who are directly involved in the educational process on problems that require an understanding of the aims, methods and points of view of educators and educational philosophy, that it becomes impractical, insofar as salary treatment is concerned, to attempt to distinguish between them and positions covered under paragraphs (1), (2), or (3) of this subsection. This paragraph (4) shall apply only to such positions as are necessary to coordinate such noneducational units or services with the educational activities of the school system.
(b) The Board, with the concurrence of the Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia, is authorized to determine which positions meet the criteria specified in subsection (a) of this section and to establish or transfer positions covered under other wage or salary fixing acts or authorities to the coverage of this Act. Similarly, the Board, with the concurrence of the said Board of Commissioners, is authorized to determine that positions covered under this Act do not meet the criteria specified in subsection (a) of this section and to remove any such position from the coverage of this Act: Provided^ That any employee occupying any position covered by this Act on the effective date of this Act, but which is later determined not to meet the criteria specified in subsection (a) of this section, shall continue to be entitled to the salary and other benefits of this Act as long as he remains in such position. The Board, subject to the concurrence of the said Board of Commissioners, is authorized to specify for any position to be brought under this Act, the class and group as established in this Act which shall apply to such position: Provided^ That such class shall be selected on the basis of the difficulty, responsibility, and qualification requirements of such position. Positions brought under this Act in accordance with this section shall be subject to the provisions of this Act to the same degree and in all respects as if such positions were specifically named in this Act. The Board is authorized to conduct such studies as are required to apply the criteria specified in subsection (a) of this section.

(c) No provision in this Act shall be interpreted as preventing any teacher, school officer, or other employee of the Board who has been granted leave to enter the armed forces of the United States or its allies from receiving any annual service increment or increments to which he would have been entitled had he remained continuously in the service of the public schools.
SEC. 8.

SEC. 9. The Board is hereby authorized to appoint and assign temporary employees within the salary structure of section 1 of this Act, whenever such action is necessary and recommended in writing by the Superintendent of Schools. Such appointments shall be for periods not to extend beyond June 30 of the fiscal year in which the appointments are made and the Board is authorized to terminate the appointment of any temporary employee at any time upon the written recommendation of the Superintendent of Schools.

If the money available hereunder for the payment of debt claims against the debtor is insufficient for the satisfaction of all claims allowed by the designee, ratable payments shall be made in accordance with subsection (g) of this section to the extent permitted by the money available and additional payments shall be made whenever the designee shall determine that substantial further money has become available, through liquidation of any such property or otherwise.

Upon good cause shown such time may be extended by the court. Such record shall include the claim as filed, such evidence with respect thereto as may have been presented to the designee or introduced into the record by him, and the determination of the designee with respect thereto, including any findings made by him. The court may, in its discretion, take additional evidence, upon a showing that such evidence was offered to and excluded by the designee, or could not reasonably have been adduced before him or was not available to him. The court shall enter judgment affirming, modifying, or reversing the designee's determination, and directing payment in the amount, if any, which it finds due.
" ( f ) If the aggregate of debt claims filed as prescribed exceeds the money from which, in accordance with subsection (d) of this section, payment may be made, the designee shall prepare and serve by registered mail on all claimants a schedule of all debt claims allowed and the proposed payment to each claimant.

The designee, within forty-five days after service on him, shall certify and file in said court a transcript of the record of proceedings with respect to such schedule. Upon good cause shown such time may be extended by the court. Such record shall include the claims in question as filed, such evidence with respect thereto as may have been presented to the designee or introduced into the record by him, any findings or other determinations made by the designee with respect thereto, and the schedule prepared by the designee. The court may, in its discretion, take additional evidence, upon a showing that such evidence was offered to and excluded by the designee or could not reasonably have been adduced before him or was not available to him. Any interested debt claimant who has filed a claim with the designee pursuant to this section, upon timely application to the court, shall be permitted to intervene in such review proceedings. The court shall enter judgment affirming or modifying the schedule as prepared by the designee and directing payment, if any be found due, pursuant to the schedule as affirmed or modified and to the extent of the money from which, in accordance with subsection (d) of this section, payment may be made. Pending the decision of the court on such complaint for review, and pending final determination of any appeal from such decision, payment may be made only to an extent, if any, consistent with the contentions of all claimants for review.

" ( h ) No debt of any kind shall be entitled to priority under any law of the United States or any State, Territory, or possession thereof, or the District of Columbia, solely by reason of becoming a debt due or owing to the United States as a result of its acquisition by the designee of the President under this title.
"(i) The sole relief and remedy available to any person seeking satisfaction of a debt claim out of any property vested in the designee under section 202 ( a ) , or the proceeds thereof, shall be the relief and remedy provided in this section, and suits for the satisfaction of debt claims shall not be instituted, prosecuted, or further maintained except in conformity with this section.

No purchaser, lessee, licensee, or other transferee of any property from the designee shall, solely by reason of such purchase, lease, license, or transfer, become liable for the payment of any debt owed by the person who owned such property prior to its vesting in the designee. Payment by the designee to any debt claimant shall constitute, to the extent of payment, a discharge of the indebtedness represented by the claim.
"SEC. 209. The officer or agency designated by the President under this title to entertain claims under section 207 (b) and section 208 shall have power to hold such hearings as may be deemed necessary; to prescribe rules and regulations governing the form and contents of claims, the proof thereof, and all other matters related to proceedings on such claims; and in connection with such proceedings to issue subpenas, administer oaths, and examine witnesses.

"SEC. 211. No property or proceeds shall be returned under this title, nor shall any payment be made or judgment awarded in respect of any property vested in any officer or agency designated by the President under this title unless satisfactory evidence is furnished to said designee, or the court, as the case may be, that the aggregate of the fees to be paid to all agents, attorneys at law or in fact, or representatives, for services rendered in connection with such return or payment or judgment does not exceed 10 per centum of the value of such property or proceeds or of such payment. Any agent, attorney at law or in fact, or representative, believing that the aggregate of the fees should be in excess of such 10 per centum may, in the case of any return of, or the making of any payment in respect of,

The court hearing such petition or a court awarding any judgment in respect of any such property or proceeds, as the case may be, shall approve an aggregate of fees in excess of 10 per centum of the value of such property or proceeds only upon a finding that there exist special circumstances of unusual hardship which require the payment of such excess. Any person accepting any fee in excess of an amount approved under this section, or retaining for more than thirty days any portion of a fee, accepted prior to such approval, in excess of the fee as approved, shall be guilty of a violation of this title.
"SEC. 212. (a) The vesting in any officer or agency designated by the President under this title of any property or the receipt by such designee of any earnings, increment, or proceeds thereof shall not render inapplicable any Federal, State, Territorial, or local tax for any period before or after such vesting.
"(b) The officer or agency designated by the President under this title shall, notwithstanding the filing of any claim or the institution of any suit under this title, pay any tax incident to any such property, or the earnings, increment, or proceeds thereof, at the earliest time appearing to him to be not contrary to the interest of the United States. The former ownei* shall not be liable for any such tax accruing while such property, earnings, increment, or proceeds are held by such designee, unless they are returned pursuant to this title without payment of such tax by the designee. Every such tax shall be paid by the designee to the same extent, as nearly as may be deemed practicable, as though the property had not been vested, and shall be paid only out of the property, or earnings, increment, or proceeds thereof, to which they are incident or out of other property acquired from the same former owner, or earnings, increment, or proceeds thereof. No tax liability may be enforced from any property or the earnings, increment, or proceeds thereof while held by the designee except with his consent. Where any property is transferred, otherwise than pursuant to section 207 (a) or 207 (b) hereof, the designee may transfer the property free and clear of any tax, except to the extent of any lien for a tax existing and perfected at the date of vesting, and the proceeds of such transfer shall, for tax purposes, replace the property in the hands of the designee.
"(c) Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, the manner of computing any Federal taxes, including without limitation by reason of this enumeration, the applicability in such computation of credits, deductions, and exemptions to which the former owner is or would be entitled, and the time and manner of any payment of such taxes and the extent of any compliance by the designee with provisions of Federal law and regulations applicable with respect to Federal taxes, shall be in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury to effectuate this section. Statutes of limitations on assessments, collection, refund, or credit of Federal taxes shall be suspended with respect to any vested property or the earnings, increment, or proceeds thereof, while vested and for six months thereafter; but no interest shall be paid upon any refund with respect to any period during which the statute of limitations is so suspended.

If, after such examination and observation, the superintendent of the hospital, in the case of a mental hospital, or the chief psychiatrist of the District of Columbia General Hospital, in the case of District of Columbia General Hospital, shall leport that in his opinion the accused is of unsound mind or mentally incompetent, such report shall be sufficient to authorize the court to commit by order the accused to a hospital for the mentally ill unless the accused or the Government objects, in which event, the court, after hearing without a jury, shall make a judicial determination of the competency of the accused to stand trial. If the court shall find the accused to be then of unsound mind or mentally incompetent to stand trial, the court shall order the accused confined to a hospital for the mentally ill.
"(b) Whenever an accused person confined to a hospital for the mentally ill is restored to mental competency in the opinion of the superintendent of said hospital, the superintendent shall certify such fact to the clerk of the court in which the indictment, information, or charge against the accused is pending and such certification shall be sufficient to authorize the court to enter an order thereon adjudicating him to be competent to stand trial, unless the accused or the Government objects, in which event, the court, after hearing without a jury, shall make a judicial determination of the competency of the accused to stand trial.
"(c) When any person tried upon an indictment or information for an offense, or tried in the juvenile court of the District of Columbia for an offense, is acquitted solely on the ground that he was insane at the time of its commission, that fact shall be set forth by the jury in their verdict.
"(d) If any person tried upon an indictment or information for an offense, or tried in the juvenile court of the District of Columbia for an offense, is acquitted solely on the ground that he was insane at the time of its commission, the court shall order such person to be confined in a hospital for the mentally ill.
"(e) Where any person has been confined in a hospital for the mentally ill pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, and the superintendent of such hospital certifies (1) that such person has recovered his sanity, (2) that, in the opinion of the superintendent, such person will not in the reasonable future be dangerous to himself or others, and (3) in the opinion of the superintendent, the person is entitled to his unconditional releiase from the hospital, and such certificate is filed with the clerk of the court in which the person was tried, and a copy thereof served on the United States Attorney or the Corporation Counsel of the District of Columbia, whichever office prosecuted the accused, such certificate shall be sufficient to authorize the court to order the unconditional release of the person so confined from further hospitalization at the expiration of fifteen days from the time said certificate was filed and served as above; but the court in its discretion may, or upon objection of the United States or the District of Colum-

If the court does not so find, the court shall order such person returned to said hospital. Where, in the judgment of the superintendent of such hospital, a person confined under subsection (d) above is not in such condition as to warrant his unconditional release, but is in a condition to be conditionally released under supervision, and such certificate is filed and served as above provided, such certificate shall be sufficient to authorize the court to order the release of such person under such conditions as the court shall see fit at the expiration of fifteen days from the time such certificate is filed and served pursuant to this section: Provided^ That the provisions as to hearing prior to unconditional release shall also apply to conditional releases, and, if, after a hearing and w^eighing the evidence, the court shall find that the condition of such person warrants his conditional release, the court shall order his release under such conditions as the court shall see fit, or, if the court does not so find, the court shall order such person returned to such hospital.

"(f) When an accused person shall be acquitted solely on the ground of insanity and ordered confined in a hospital for the mentally ill, such person and his estate shall be charged with the expense of his support in such hospital.
"(g) Nothing herein contained shall preclude a person confined under the authority of this section from establishing his eligibility for release under the provisions of this section by a writ of habeas corpus.

I t is the purpose of this title to authorize the extension of credit to assist in the provision of certain essential public works or facilities by States, municipalities, or other political subdivisions of States, where

"(f) Debentures issued under this title shall be executed in the name of the Armed Services Housing Mortgage Insurance Fund as obligor, shall be signed by the Commissioner, by either his written or engraved signature, and shall be negotiable.

TITLE I--BANKS FOR COOPERATIVES

SEC. 101. Section 42 of the Farm Credit Act of 1933, as amended, is amended to read as follows:
" S E C . 42. (a) CLASSES OF STOCK; OWNERSHIP; VOTING R I G H T S ;
DIVIDENDS; AND RETIREMENT or STOCK.--Except as provided in section 111 of the Farm Credit Act of 1955, each regional bank for cooperatives shall have the following classes of stock, all of which shall have a par value of $100 per share:
"(1) Class A stock shall be issued to and held by the Governor of the Farm Credit Administration on behalf of the United States, and stock of such banks held by the Governor on the effective date of title I of the F a r m Credit Act of 1955 shall be exchanged, share for share, for class A stock of the respective banks. Class A stock shall be nonvoting and no dividends shall be paid thereon. At the end of each fiscal year, each of such banks, subject to the provisions of sections 33 and 40, shall determine the amount of class A stock that shall be retired at par by that bank. The minimum amount of class A stock that shall be retired shall be the equivalent in dollar value of the amount of class C stock issued for that year, except that class C stock issued by a regional bank on account of class C stock issued to it by the central bank, class C stock issued by a regional bank in exchange for class B stock the proceeds of which were used to retire an equivalent amount of class A stock, and class C stock issued by a regional bank in exchange for capital stock of the bank outstanding on the effective date of title I of the Farm Credit Act of 1955, shall not be included in such bank's calculation. Any amount of class A stock retired in excess of such minimum amount in one year may be used to reduce to that extent the amount of such stock required to be retired in any subsequent year. Funds from the retirement of class A stock shall be paid into the revolving fund authorized by the Agricultural Marketing Act, as amended, and shall continue to be available for the purchase of class A stock in the banks in accordance with sections 33 and 40.
"(2) Class B stock may be issued in series and amounts approved by the Farm Credit Administration, and may be sold or transferred to any person subject to the approval of the issuing bank. Such stock shall be issued only at par and shall be nonvoting. Any bank may pay dividends of not to exceed 4 per centum per annum on class B stock if declared by the board of directors and approved by the Farm Credit Administration and if the surplus account of the bank, after payment of such dividends, will not be less than 25 per centum of the sum of all its outstanding capital stock. Dividends on class B stock shall not be cumulative, but no bank shall distribute in any year any of its net savings as patronage refunds as provided in section 36 (a) unless for that year a dividend of at least 2 per centum is declared and paid upon outstanding class B stock of the bank. Each series of class B stock shall be issued only with the appi;oval of the

Farm Credit Administration and shall carry on the face of each certificate a statement of the maximum dividend which may be declared and paid thereon and of the minimum dividend which shall be declared and paid thereon before the bank may distribute any of its net savings as patronage refunds: Promded^ That such maximum and minimum dividends may be the same amount. After all class A stock has been retired, class B stock may be called for retirement at par with the approval of the Farm Credit Administration and shall be called in such manner that the oldest outstanding stock at any given time will be retired first. Any holder of class B stock whose stock has been called for retirement may elect, with the approval of the issuing bank, to leave Ms stock in the bank subject to its being included in the next call for retirement.
"(3) Class C stock, except as approved by the Farm Credit Administration and consented to by the issuing bank, may be issued only to banks for cooperatives and farmers' cooperative associations as defined jj^ section 15 (a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act, as amended. Such stock may be issued in fractional shares, shall be issued at its fair book value not exceeding par, as determined by the bank, and no dividends shall be paid on it. Each holder of one or more shares of class C stock which is eligible to borrow from a bank for cooperatives shall be entitled to one vote only: Provided^ That any such holder which within the period of two years next preceding a date, fixed by the Farm Credit Administration, prior to commencement of the voting has not been a borrower from a bank of which it holds class C stock shall not be entitled to vote. From time to time each bank for cooperatives shall obtain information concerning its class C stockholders to determine whether they continue to be eligible to borrow from the bank and to vote. Any class C stockholder found by the bank to be ineligible to borrow shall not be entitled to vote until its eligibility is reestablished to the satisfaction of the bank. Whenever in section 5 of the F a r m
Credit Act of 1937, as amended, and section 4 (a) of the F a r m Credit Act of 1953, provision is made for a nomination or election by cooperatives which are stockholders or subscribers to the guaranty fund of ^y^y bank for cooperatives the term 'cooperatives which are stockholders or subscribers to the guaranty fund' or the equivalent of that term, shall mean such cooperatives which are eligible to vote. Each borrower from a bank for cooperatives shall be required to own at the time the loan is made at least one share of class C stock. The purchase price of such stock may be retained out of the loan. In addition, each borrower as defined by the Farm Credit Administration for purposes of this sentence, shall be required to invest quarterly in class C stock an amount equal to not less than 10 nor more than 25 per centum, as prescribed by the board of directors of the bank with the approval of the Farm Credit Administration, of the amount of interest payable by it to the bank during the calendar quarter. Payments for such stock shall be made quarterly or when the regular interest payments of the borrower are payable, out the stock shall be issued to the borrower as of the end of each fiscal year in the amount of the payments for stock made by it during the year. Each regional bank shall purchase at least one share of class C stock of the central bank. In addition, the regional bank shall be required to invest quarterly in class C stock of the central bank an amount equal to not less than 10 nor more than 25 per centum, as prescribed by the board of directors of the central bank with the approval of the F a r m Credit Administration, of the amount of interest payable by the regional bank to the central bank during the calendar quarter by reason of any interest purchased by the central bank in a loan made by the regional bank. Payments for such stock shall be made to the central bank and the stock shall be issued to

69 S T A T . ]

P U B L I C LAW 3 4 7 - A U G . 11, 1955

the regional bank in the same manner, insofar as practicable, as is provided in this section for payments for and issuance of stock on account of loans by the regional bank in which the central bank does not purchase any interest. Subject to rules prescribed by the board of directors of the lending bank with the approval of the Farm Credit Administration a borrower may convert class B stock into class C stock for the purpose of making the investment in class C stock required by this paragraph. After retirement of all class A stock, class C stock also may be retired at par by calling the oldest outstanding class C stock, but class C stock that was issued for a fiscal year period shall not be called for retirement until all class B stock that was issued during or prior to that fiscal year has been called for retirement.
"(b) GUARANTY FUND SUBSCRIPTIONS IN LIEU OF STOCK.--If a cooperative association is not authorized under the laws of the State in which it is organized to take stock in the bank, the bank shall, in lieu thereof, require the association to pay into or have on deposit in a guaranty fund of the bank, or the bank may retain out of the amount of the loan and credit to the guaranty fund, a sum equal to the amount of class C stock which the association would otherwise be required by subsection (a) (3) of this section to own at the time the loan is made and to purchase thereafter. Any such association may make additional payments into the guaranty fund from time to time in lieu of the purchase of class B stock, and shall receive credits to such fund in lieu of patronage refunds payable in class C stock. Each reference in this Act to capital stock or class B or class C stock shall include also the guaranty fund equivalents of such stock, and, to the extent permitted under the laws of a State in which a cooperative association IS organized, a holder of guaranty fund equivalents of either class B or class C stock shall have the same rights and status as a holder of class B or class C stock, respectively. The rights and obligations of the bank as respects such.guaranty fund equivalents shall be identical to its rights and obligations as respects class B or class C stock, respectively.
*'(c) L I E N ON STOCK.--Except as hereinafter provided in the case of an association which is a direct borrower from the central bank, each bank for cooperatives shall have a first lien on all stock in the bank owned by each cooperative association as additional collateral for any indebtedness of such association to the bank. In the case of an association which is a direct borrower from the central bank, the central bank shall have a first lien on any amount of class C stock which the borrowing association owns in any regional bank on account of direct loans of such association from the central bank; and the regional bank shall have a lien on such stock junior only to the lien of the central bank. I n any case where the debt of a borrower is in default, the bank may, in accordance with regulations of the Farm Credit Administration, retire and cancel all or a part of the stock of the defaulting borrower at the fair book value thereof, not exceeding par, in total or partial liquidation of the debt, as the case may be, and, to the extent required, corresponding shares held by a regional bank in the central bank shall be retired.
"(d) CALCULATION or PROPORTIONATE INTERESTS IN BANKS.--For
the purpose of determining pursuant to section 5 (d) (2) (C) of the Farm Credit Act of 1937, as amended, the amount of the capital stock and subscriptions to the guaranty fund of a regional bank for cooperatives held by cooperatives the term 'capital stock and subscriptions to the guaranty fund held by cooperatives' or the equivalent of that term shall also mean all outstanding class B and class C stock and the guaranty fund equivalents thereof."

amended to read as follows:
"SEC. 35. APPLICATION OF REGIONAL B A N K STOCK PROVISIONS TO
CENTRAL BANK.--All provisions of law with respect to class A, class B, and class C stock in the regional banks for cooperatives shall apply to the Central Bank for Cooperatives except as they may be inconsistent with the provisions of this section. Each borrower from the central bank shall be required to own at the time the loan is made at least one share of class C stock in such regional bank as the Farm Credit Administration shall designate and shall be required to invest quarterly in class C stock in such regional bank or banks as the Farm Credit Administration shall designate an amount equal to not less than 10 nor more than 25 per centum, as prescribed by the board of directors of the central bank with the approval of the F a r m Credit Administration, of the amount of interest payable by such borrower to the central bank during the calendar quarter. Paj^ments for such stock shall be made quarterly or when the regular interest payments of such borrower are payable; but the stock shall be issued to the borrower as of the end of each fiscal year in the amount of the payments for stock made by it during such year. The regional bank whose stock is so issued to such borrower shall purchase a corresponding amount of class C stock in the central bank."
SEC. 103. (a) Section 36 of the F a r m Credit Act of 1933, as amended,
is amended to read as follows: "SEC. 36. (a) APPLICATION OF SAVINGS.--Each bank for cooper-
atives, at the end of each fiscal year, shall determine the amount of its net savings after paying or providing for all operating expenses (including reasonable valuation reserves and losses in excess of any such applicable reserves) and shall apply such savings as follows: (1) To the restoration of the amount of the impairment, if any, of capital stock, as determined by its board of directors; (2) 25 per centum of any remaining savings shall be used to create and maintain a surplus account; (3) if said bank shall have outstanding capital stock held by the United States during the whole or any part of the fiscal year, it shall next pay to the United States as a franchise tax, a sum equal to 25 per centum of its net savings then remaining, not exceeding, however, a rate of return on such Government capital calculated at a rate equal to the computed average annual rate of interest on all public issues of public debt obligations of the United States issued during the fiscal year ending next before such tax is due, as certified to the F a r m Credit Administration by the Secretary of the Treasury; (4) reasonable contingency reserves may be established; (5) dividends on class B stock may be declared as provided in section 42 (a) ( 2 ) ; and (6) any remaining net savings shall be distributed as patronage refunds as provided in subsection (b) of this section: Provided, That any patronage refunds received by a regional bank from the central bank shall be excluded from net savings of the regional bank for the purpose of computing such franchise tax. Amounts applied as provided in (2) and (4) above after the effective date of title I of the Farm Credit Act of 1955 shall be allocated on a patronage basis approved by the Farm Credit Administration. At the end of any fiscal year, any portion of the reserve established under (4) above which is no longer deemed necessary shall be transferred to the surplus account and, if the surplus account of any such bank for cooperatives exceeds 25 per centum of the sum of all its outstanding capital stock, the bank may distribute in the same manner as a patronage refund any part or all of such excess which has been allocated: Provided, That any surplus and contingency reserves shown on the books of the banks as of the effective date of title I of the F a r m Credit Act of 1955 shall not be distributed as patronage refunds.

In making such distributions, the oldest outstanding allocations shall be distributed first. Wherever used in this Act, the words 'surplus co'unt"''^^"^ '^' account' as applied to any bank for cooperatives shall mean any surpluses and contingency reserves shown on the books of the banks as of the effective date of title I of the Farm Credit Act of 1955 and any amounts applied as provided in (2) above after the effective date of said title I. Said surplus account shall be divided to show the amounts thereof subject to allocation as provided in this section and may be further subdivided as prescribed by the Farm Credit Administration. I n the event of a net loss in any fiscal year after providing for all operating expenses (including reasonable valuation reserves and losses in excess of any such applicable reserves), such loss shall be absorbed by: first, charges to allocated contingency reserves; second, charges to allocated surplus; third, charges to other contingency reserves and surplus; fourth, the impairment of class C stock; and fifth, the impairment of all other stock.

" ( b ) PATRONAGE REFUNDS.--The patronage refunds of each regional bank for cooperatives shall be paid in class C stock to borrowers, as defined by the Farm Credit Administration for the purposes of this subsection, during the fiscal year for which the refunds are declared. Patronage refunds of the Central Bank for Cooperatives shall be paid in class C stock to the regional banks for cooperatives upon the basis of interests held by the central bank in loans made by the regional banks and upon direct loans made by the central bank to cooperative associations; and any part of such refunds derived from such direct loans of the central bank shall be paid in class C stock issued to the regional bank or banks which issued to the borrower the stock incident to the loans, or to a regional bank or banks designated by the Farm Credit Administration, and such bank or banks shall issue a like amount of class C stock to the borrowers. All patronage refunds shall be paid in the proportion that the amount of interest earned on the loans of each borrower bears to the total interest earned on the loans of all borrowers during the fiscal year.

"(c) APPLICATION OF ASSETS ON LIQUIDATION OR DISSOLUTION.--In
the case of liquidation or dissolution of any bank for cooperatives, after the payment or retirement, as the case may be, first, of all liabilities; second, of all capital stock issued before the effective date of title I of the Farm Credit Act of 1955 held by cooperative associations at par, all class A stock at pfir, and all class B stock at p a r ; and third, of all class C stock at p a r ; any surpluses and contingency reserves existing on the effective date of said title I shall be paid to the holders of outstanding capital stock issued before the effective date of said title I, class A stock and class C stock pro rata, and any remaining surplus and contingency reserves shall be distributed to those entities to which they are allocated on the books of the bank. If it should become necessary to use any surplus or contingency reserves to pay any liabilities or to retire any capital stock, allocated contingency reserves and surplus shall be exhausted first in accordance with rules prescribed by the Farm Credit Administration."
(b) For purposes of applying the amendment in subsection (a) of this section, that part of the fiscal year 195G preceding the effective date of title I of this Act and that part of such year following said effective date shall be deemed to be separate fiscal years.

"SEC. 8. (a) The Congress finds that there exists special circum-

stances in certain agricultural areas which cause such areas to be at

a disadvantage insofar as agricultural development is concerned, which

circumstances include the following: (1) There is concentration of

farm families on farms either too small or too unproductive or both;

(2) such farm operators because of limited productivity are unable

to make adjustments and investments required to establish profitable

operations; (3) the productive capacity of the existing farm unit

does not permit profitable employment of available labor; (4) because

of limited resources, many of these farm families are not able to

make full use of current extension programs designed for families

operating economic units nor are extension facilities adequate to pro-

vide the assistance needed to produce desirable results.

"(b) In order to further the purposes of section 2 in such areas

and to encourage complementary development essential to the welfare

of such areas, there are hereby authorized to be appropriated such

sums as the Congress from time to time shall determine to be neces-

sary for payments to the States, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico

on the basis of special needs in such areas as determined by the Sec-

retary of Agriculture.

"(c) In determining that the area has such special need, the Secre-

tary shall find that it has a substantial number of disadvantaged farms

" ( d ) No more than 10 per centum of the sums available under this section shall be allotted to any one State. The Secretary shall use project proposals and plans of work submitted by the State Extension directors as a basis for determining the allocation of funds appropriated pursuant to this section.
"(e) Sums appropriated pursuant to this section shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for, appropriations otherwise available under this Act. The amounts authorized to be appropriated pursuant to this section shall not exceed a sum in any year equal to 10 per centum of sums otherwise appropriated pursuant to this Act."

(f) the contract shall, subject to the district's compliance with all of its terms and conditions, continue in force until December 31, 1955, and shall be renewed automatically for each of the nine succeeding calendar years unless either of the parties shall, on or before November 1 of any year, serve written notice of its intention that the contract shall not be renewed.

"TITLE VII--PEOPERTY TRANSFERRED FROM THE RECONSTRUCTION FINANCE CORPORATION

"DECI^RATION OF POLICY
'SEC, 701. The Congress recognizes that the transfer of real property having a taxable status from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation or any of its subsidiaries to another Government department has often operated to remove such property from the tax rolls of States and local taxing authorities, thereby creating an undue and unexpected burden upon such States and local taxing authorities, and causing disruption of their operations. I t is the purpose of this title to furnish temporary measures of relief for such States and local taxing authorities by providing that payments in lieu of taxes shall be made with respect to real property so transferred on or after January 1, 1946.

"DEFINITIONS
"SEC. 702. As used in this title " ( a ) The term 'State' means each of the several States of the United States and the Territories of Alaska and Hawaii. "(b) The term 'real property' means (1) any interest in land, and (2) any improvement made thereon prior to any transfer thereof occurring on or after January 1, 1946, from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to any other Government department, if for the purpose of taxation such interest or improvement is characterized as real property under the applicable law of the State in which such land is located. " ( c ) The term 'local taxing authority' means any county ox municipality, and any subdivision of any State, county, or municipality, which is authorized by law to levy and collect taxes upon real property.
"(d) The terms 'real property tax' and 'real property taxes' do not include any special assessment levied upon real property after the date of a transfer of such real property occurring on or after January 1, 1946, from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to any other Government department.
"(e) The term 'Government department' means any department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States, except the Reconstruction Finance Corporation.
"(f) The term'transfer'means-- " (1) a transfer of custody and control of, or accountability for
the care and handling of, any real property, or " (2) a transfer of legal title to any real property.
"(g) The term 'Reconstruction Finance Corporation' includes all subsidiaries of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation.

Government department, and the title to such real property has been held by the United States continuously since such transfer, then on each date occurring on or after January 1,1955, and prior to January 1, 1959, on which real property taxes levied by any State or local taxing authority with respect to any period become due, the Government department which has custody and control of such real property shall pay to the appropriate State and local taxing authorities an amount equal to the amount of the real property tax which would be payable to each such State or local taxing authority on such date if legal title to such real property had been held by a private citizen on such date and during all periods to which such date relates.

a LIMITATIONS
"SEC. 704. (a) The failure of any Government department to make, or to make timely payment of, any payment authorized by section 703 shall not subject--
"(1) any Government department, or any person who is a subsequent purchaser of any real property from any Government department, to the payment of any penalty or penalty interest, or to any payment in lieu of any penalty or penalty interest; or
"(2) any real estate or other property or property right to any lien, attachment, foreclosure, garnishment, or other legal proceeding. "(b) No payment shall be made under section 703 with respect to any real property of any of the following categories:
"(1) Real property taxable by any State or local taxing authority under any provision of law, or with respect to which any payment in lieu of taxes is payable under any other provision of law.
"(2) Real property used or held primarily for any purpose for which real property owned by any private citizen would be exempt from real property tax under the constitution or laws of the State in which the property is situated.
"(3) Real property used or held primarily for the rendition of service to or on behalf of the local public, including (but not limited to) the following categories of real property: courthouses; post offices and other property used for purposes incidental to postal operations; and federally owned airports maintained and operated by the Civil Aeronautics Administration.
"(4) Office buildings and facilities which are an integral part of, or are used for purposes incidental to the use made of, any properties described in paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of this subsection. "(c) Nothing contained in this title shall establish any liability of any Government department for the payment of any payment in lieu of taxes with respect to any real property for any period before January 1, 1955, or after December 31, 1958.

W H E R E A S the ever-increasing awareness among public and private employers of the desirability of hiring the handicapped should be maintained and stimulated further; and
W H E R E A S the observance of National Employ the Physically Handicapped Week once each year, as authorized by a joint resolution of the Congress approved August 11, 1945 (69 Stat. 530), emphasizes the need for a year-round program:

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

W H E R E A S Count Casimir Pulaski crossed the Atlantic to fight in the cause of freedom and gave his life for that cause on October 11, 1779, as a result of wounds received while leading the Pulaski Legion in a gallant cavalry charge at the siege of Savannah; and
W H E R E A S the story of this Polish patriot's supreme contribution to our independence is a treasured chapter in the annals of a grateful Nation; and
W H E R E A S it is fitting that we should honor the memory of this distinguished soldier, who attained the rank of Brigadier General in the American Revolutionary Army, on the one hundred and seventyfifth anniversary of his heroic death:

to be imi^orted into the United States after September 30, 1954, under such conditions and in such quantities as to render or tend to render ineffective, or materially interfere with, the price-support program undertaken by the Department of Agriculture with respect to oats
pursuant to sections 301 and 401 of the Agricultural Act of 1949, as amended, or to reduce substantially the amount of products processed in the United States from domestic oats with respect to which such program of the Department of Agriculture is being undertaken; and
W H E R E A S , on August 20,1954,1 caused the United States Tariff Commission to make an investigation under the said section 22 with respect to this matter: and
W H E R E A S the said Tariff Commission has made such investigation and has reported to me its findings and recommendations made in connection therewith; and

NOW, THEREFORE, I, DWIGHT I). EISENHOWER, President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the said section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended, do hereby proclaim that the total aggregate quantity of oats, hulled and unhulled, and unhulled ground oats entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption during the period from October 1, 1954, to September 30, 1955, inclusive, shall not be permitted to exceed 40,000,000 bushels of 32 pounds each, which l^ermissible total quantity I find and declare to be proportionately not less than 50 ])er centum of the total average aggregate annual quantity of such oats entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption during the representative period from July 1, 1948, to June 30, 1953, inclusive; and that, of the foregoing permissible total quantity, not more than 39,312,000 bushels of 32 pounds each shall be imported from Canada and not more than 688,000 bushels of 32 pounds each shall be imported from other foreign countries.

VETERANS DAY, 1954 BY T H E P R E S I D E N T OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

A PROCLAMATION

5 u s e 87a. Veterans Day, 1954.

W H E R E A S it has long been our custom to commemorate November 11, the anniversary of the ending of World W a r I, by paying tribute to the heroes of that tragic struggle and by rededicating ourselves to the cause of peace; and
W H E R E A S in the intervening years the United States has been involved in two other great military conflicts, which have added millions of veterans living and dead to the honor rolls of this Nation; and
W H E R E A S the Congress passed a concurrent resolution on June 4, 1926 (44 Stat. 1982), calling for the observance of November 11 with appropriate ceremonies, and later provided in an act approved May 13, 1938 (52 Stat. 351), that the eleventh of November should be a legal holiday and should be known as Armistice Day; and
W H E R E A S , in order to expand the significance of that commemoration and in order that a grateful Nation might pay appropriate homage to the veterans of all its wars who have contributed so much to the preservation of this Nation, the Congress, by an act approved June 1, 1954 (68 Stat. 168), changed the name of the holiday to Veterans Day:
NOW, THEREFORE, I, DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER, President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon all of our citizens to observe Thursday, November 11, 1954, as Veterans Day. On that day let us solemnly remember the sacrifices of all those who fought so valiantly, on the seas, in the air, and on foreign shores, to preserve our heritage of freedom, and let us reconsecrate ourselves to the task of promoting an enduring peace so that their ejfforts shall not have been in vain. I also direct the appropriate officials of the Government to arrange for the display of the'flag of the United States on all public buildings on Veterans Day.
I n order to insure proper and widespread observance of this anniversary, all veterans, all veterans' organizations, and the entire citizenry will wish to join hands in the common purpose. Toward this end, I am. designating the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs as Chairman of a Veterans Day National Committee, which shall include such other persons as the Chairman may select, and which will coordinate at the national level necessary planning for the observance. I am also requesting the heads of all departments and agencies of the Executive branch of the Government to assist the National Committee in every way possible.

W H E R E A S this autumn marks the one hundredth anniversary of Florence Nightingale's historic contribution to the cause of nursing by her heroic leadership in alleviating human suffering in the Crimea; and
W H E R E A S a continuing renewal and extension of the ranks of nurses, through the attraction of young people to the nursing profession, is of grave importance to the Nation's future well-being; and
W H E R E A S the support of an informed and sympathetic public is essential to progress in the humanitarian efforts of our nurses; and
W H E R E A S the Congress, by a joint resolution approved August 23,1954, 68 Stat. 766, has designated the period beginning October 11, 1954, and ending October 16, 1954, as National Nurse Week, in honor of the professional nurses of America and in recognition of the vitally important service they have rendered in the promotion of the national health and welfare; and
W H E R E A S the Congress, in the same resolution, has requested the President to issue a proclamation calling upon all the people of the United States to cooperate in the observance of that week:
NOW, THEREFORE, I, DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER, President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon all citizens to observe the period beginning Monday, October 11, 1954, and ending Saturday, October 16, 1954, as National Nurse Week with appropriate ceremonies and activities
I also invite the Governors of the States, Territories, and possessions of the United States to issue similar proclamations, and I urge the medical profession, the press, and the radio and television industries, as well as other interested groups, to unite in public tribute to all those who give nursing care. And I call upon the people generally to express their appreciation of the untiring efforts of our nurses in caring for the health needs of the people of this Nation.

BY THE PRESIDENT OF T H E UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
A PROCLAMATION
i^ W H E R E A S , pursuant to section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as added by section 31 of the Act of August 24, 1935, 49 Stat. 773, reenacted by section 1 of the Act of June 3, 1937, 50 Stat. 246, and amended by section 3 of the Act of July 3,1948, 62 Stat. 1248, section 3 of the Act of J u n e 28,1950, 64 Stat. 261, and section 8 (b) of the Act of June 16, 1951, 65 Stat. 72 (7 U. S. C. 624), on April 13, 1950 the President caused the United States Tariff Commission to make an investigation to determine whether almonds, filberts, walnuts, Brazil nuts, or cashews are being or are practically certain to be imported into the United States under such conditions and in such quantities as to render or tend to render ineffective, or materially interfere with, certain programs undertaken by the Department of Agriculture with respect to almonds, pecans, filberts, or walnuts, or to reduce substantially the amount of any product processed in the United States from almonds, pecans, filberts, or walnuts with respect to which any such program is being undertaken; and
2. W H E R E A S the said Commission instituted such an investigation on April 13,1950, which it has been conducting since that date on a continuing basis and in the course of which it has from time to time reported to the President regarding the need for the imposition of restrictions pursuant to the said section 22 in order to prevent imports of almonds, filberts, walnuts, Brazil nuts, or cashews from rendering ineffective, or materially interfering with, the said programs, or from reducing substantially the amount of any product processed in the United States from almonds, pecans, filberts, or walnuts with respect to which any such program is being undertaken; and
3. W H E R E A S import fees on shelled almonds and blanched, roasted, or otherwise prepared or preserved almonds (not including almond paste) imposed pursuant to the President's proclamation of September 29, 1953 (Proclamation 3034; 18 F . R. 6345), which proclamation was issued under the authority of the said section 22, will cease to apply to such articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption after September 30, 1954; and
4. W H E R E A S further in the course of the said investigation, on September 24, 1954, the said Commission reported to me its findings regarding the need for import restrictions under the said section 22 on certain tree nuts after September 30, 1954; and
5. W H E R E A S , on the basis of such report of September 24, 1954, I find that shelled almonds, and blanched, roasted, or otherwise prepared or preserved almonds (not including almond paste), and shelled filberts, whether or not blanched, are practically certain to be imported into the United States during the period October 1, 1954, to September 30,1955, both dates inclusive, under such conditions and in such quantities as to render or tend to render ineffective, or materially interfere with, the programs undertaken by the Department of Agricul-
^"^ under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended, with respect to almonds and filberts, which programs will be in operation during such period; and

A PROCLAMATION

Early in our history the Pilgrim fathers inaugurated the custom of

dedicating one day at harvest time to rendering thanks to Almighty

God for the bounties of the soil and for H i s mercies throughout the

year. At this autumnal season tradition suggests and our hearts

require thfit we follow that hallowed custom and bow in reverent

(hanks for the blessings bestowed upon us individually and as a

in their quest for religious freedom, remains free and strong, and that

each of us can worship God in his own way, according to the dictates

of his conscience.

We are grateful for the innumerable daily manifestations of Divine

goodness in affairs both public and private, for equal opportunities

for all to labor and to serve, and for the continuance of those homely

joys and satisfactions which enrich our lives.

With gratitude in our hearts for all our blessings, may we be ever

mindful of the obligations inherent in our strength, and may we

rededicate ourselves to unselfish striving for the common betterment

of mankind.

FURTHER MODIFICATION or RESTRICTIONS ON IMPORTS OF PEANUTS
BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
A PROCLAMATION
W H E R E A S , pursuant to section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended (7 U. S.

W H E R E A S on February 18, 1955, the United States Tariff Commission submitted to me a report of its findings and recommendation made in connection with a supplemental investigation conducted by the Commission with respect to peanuts, on the basis of which supplemental investigation and report I issued Proclamation No. 3084

W H E R E A S , pursuant to section 22 (d) of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended, the United States Tariff Commission has made a second supplemental investigation to determine whether the deficit

in the domestic supply of peanuts is such as to require an increase in the quantity of peanuts, whether shelled, not shelled, blanched, salted, prepared, or preserved, which may be permitted to be entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption during the quota year ending June 30, 1955, and during the quota year beginning July 1, 1955, to meet essential requirements of domestic peanut users, and, if so, what additional quantity or quantities of such peanuts may be permitted to be so entered or withdrawn without materially interfering with or rendering ineffective the peanut program of the Department of Agriculture; and
W H E R E A S the United States Tariff Commission has submitted to me a report of its findings and recommendations in connection with the said second supplemental investigation; and
W H E R E A S , on the basis of the said second supplemental investigation and report of the Tariff Commission, I find that the deficit in the domestic supply of peanuts is such as to require the admission of an additional quantity of peanuts, as hereinafter proclaimed, to meet the essential requirements of domestic peanut users until supplies become available from the 1955 domestic crop; and

W H E R E A S Memorial Day each year serves as a solemn reminder of the scourge of war and its bitter aftermath of sorrow; and
W H E R E A S this day has traditionally been devoted to paying homage to loved ones who lie in hallowed graves throughout the land, having sacrificed their lives that war might end; and
W H E R E A S in tribute to these silent dead it is fitting that we lift up our voices together in supplication to Almighty God for wisdom in our search for an enduring peace; and
W H E R E A S the Congress, in a joint resolution approved May 11, 1950, provided that Memorial Day should be set aside as a day of prayer for permanent peace, and requested the President to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to observe each Memorial Day in that manner:
^ ^ ^ ' THEREFORE, I, DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Memorial Day, Monday, the thirtieth of May, 1955, as a day of Nation-wide prayer for permanent peace, and I designate the hour beginning in each locality at eleven o'clock in the morning as a period in which the people of this Nation may unite in beseeching God to guide the nations of the world into the ways of peace.

W H E R E A S , by joint resolution approved February 29, 1952 (66 Stat. 9 ) , the Congress of the United States has designated the 17th day of September of each year as Citizenship Day in commemoration of the signing of the Constitution of the L^nited States on September 17, 1787, and in recognition of all our citizens who have cdme of age and all who have been naturalized during the year; and

by the Constitution and the statutes, including section 350 of the

48 Stat. 943. 19USC1351.

Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, on January 9, 1936, he entered into a trade agreement with the Swiss Federal Council, including two

schedules and a declaration annexed thereto (49 Stat. (pt. 2) 3918),

and by a proclamation of January 9, 1936 (49 Stat. (pt. 2) 3917), he

proclaimed the said trade agreement, which proclamation has been

supplemented by a proclamation of May 7,1936 (49 Stat. (pt. 2) 3959),

and a proclamation of November 28, 1940 (54 Stat. (pt. 2) 2461);

was supplemented on October 13,1950, by certain provisions set forth

in the 13th recital of the President's proclamation of November 26,

Act of 1951, and in accordance with the said trade agreement specified

in the first recital as supplemented on October 13,1950, the President

proclaimed modifications of duty concessions granted by the United

States with respect to certain products described in item 367 (a)

68 Stat. c47.

of Schedule I I of the said trade agreement, effective at the close of

of the supplemental provisions referred to in the second recital of this

proclamation, in order to maintain, to the extent practicable, the gen-

eral level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions in the

said trade agreement;

5. W H E R E A S I have found as a fact that under the circumstances

recited above existing duties or other import restrictions of the United

7. W H E R E A S reasonable public notice of the intention to negotiate a supplementary trade agreement with Switzerland was given and the views presented by persons interested in the negotiation of such supplementary agreement were received and considered;
8. W H E R E A S , after seeking and obtaining information and advice with respect thereto from the Departments of State, Agriculture, Commerce, and Defense, and from other sources, I entered into a trade agreement on June 8, 1955, with the Swiss Federal Council, further supplementing the said trade agreement specified in the first recitalj a copy of which supplementary agreement of June 8, 1955, including the supplemental schedule annexed thereto, authentic in both the English and French languages, is annexed to this proclamation ;
9. W H E R E A S I find that the compensatory modifications provided for in the said supplementary trade agreement specified in the eighth recital constitute appropriate action toward maintaining the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions in the said trade agreement specified in the first recital, and that the purpose set forth in section 350 (a) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, will be promoted by such compensatory modifications of existing duties and other import restrictions and continuance of existing customs and excise treatment as are set forth and provided for in the said supplementary trade agreement;
10. W H E R E A S it is provided in paragraph numbered 4 of the said supplementary agreement specified in the eighth recital that it shall enter into force on July 11,1955;
11. W H E R E A S I find that such modifications of existing duties and other import restrictions and such continuance of existing customs and excise treatment of articles as are hereinafter proclaimed in P a r t I of this proclamation will be required or appropriate, on and after July 11, 1955, to carry out the said supplementary trade agreement specified in the eighth recital;
12. W H E R E A S , pursuant to the authority vested in the President by the Constitution and the statutes, including section 350 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, on October 30, 1947, he entered into an exclusive trade agreement with the Government of the Republic of Cuba (61 Stat. (pt. 4) 3699), and by Proclamation No. 2764 of January Ij 1948 (62 Stat.

13. W H E R E A S I determine that, in view of the finding set forth in the eleventh recital of this proclamation, the deletion of the second item 28 (a) (as amended by the said proclamation of J u n e 2, 1951) from the list set forth in the ninth recital of the said proclamation of January 1, 1948, as amended and rectified, will be required or appropriate to carry out the said exclusive trade agreement specified in the twelfth recital of this proclamation on and after July 11, 1955:

W H E R E A S , pursuant to section 22 (d) of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended, the United States Tariff Commission has made a supplemental investigation to determine whether changed circumstances require the modification of the said Proclamation No. 3073 in order to carry out the purposes of the said section 22 and has submitted to me a report of its findings and recommendations with respect thereto; and
W H E R E A S , on the basis of the said supplemental investigation and report of the Tariff Commission, I find that changed circumstances require the modification of the said Proclamation No. 3073 in the manner hereinafter proclaimed, in order to carry out the purposes of the said section 22; and
W H E R E A S I find and declare that the entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption during the remainder of the 12-month

68 Stat. C44.

1. W H E R E A S , pursuant to the authority vested in the President by the Constitution and the statutes, including section 350 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, on October 30, 1947, he entered into a trade agreement with certain foreign countries, which trade agreement con-
sists of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the related Protocol of Provisional Application thereof, together with the Final Act Adopted at the conclusion of the Second Session of the Preparatory Committee of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Employment (61 Stat. (pts. 5 and 6) A7, A11, and A2050), and by Proclamation No. 2761A of December 16, 1947 (61 Stat. 1103), he proclaimed such modifications of existing duties and other import restrictions of the United States and such continuance of existing customs or excise treatment of articles imported into the United States as were then found to be required or appropriate to carry out the said trade agreement on and after January 1, 1948, which proclamation has been supplemented by Proclamation 2954 of November 26, 1951 (66 Stat. c 6 ) , by the proclamations referred to in the second recital of the said proclamation of November 26, 1951, by Proclamation 2960 of January 5, 1952 (66 Stat. c l 6 ) , by Proclamation 3007 of March 2, 1953 (67 Stat. c35), and bv Proclamation 3059 of J u n e 30, ] 954 (3 CFR, 1954 S U P P . , p. 2 6 ) ;

2. W H E R E A S Public Law 479,83d Congress (68 Stat. (pt. 1) 454), 19 use 1001 par. provides as foUows:

"Paragraph 1530 (e) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, is amended by adding at the end thereof the following: 'For the purposes of this paragraph and any existing or future proclamation of the President relating thereto, footwear of which a major portion, in area, of the basic wearing surface of the outer soles (that part of the article, not including the heel, that is designed to be the basic wearing surface and to resist wear on contact with any surface) is composed of India rubber or any substitute for rubber, or both, shall be deemed to have soles wholly or in chief value of india rubber or substitutes for rubber.' The foregoing amendment shall enter into force as soon as practicable, on a date to be specified by the President in a notice to the Secretary of the Treasury following such negotiations as may be necessary to effect a modification or termination of any international obligations of the United States with which the amendment might conflict, but in any event not later than one hundred and eighty days after the passage of this Act.";

3. W H E R E A S section 2 of Public Law 689, 83d Congress (68 Stat. (pt. 1) 896), reads as follows:

"SEC. 2 (a) Paragraph 720 of title I of the Tariff Act of 1930 (U. S. C, 1952 edition, title 19, sec. 1001, par. 720), is amended by adding at the end thereof the following subparagraph:
' " ( d ) Fish sticks and similar products of any size or shape, fillets, or other portions of fish, if breaded, coated with batter, or similarly prepared, but not packed in oil or in oil and other substances, whether in bulk or in containers of any size or kind, and whether or not described or provided for elsewhere in this Act, if uncooked, 20 per centum ad valorem; cooked in any degree, 30 per centum ad valorem.'
"(b) The foregoing amendment shall enter into effect as soon as practicable on a date to be specified by the President in a notice to the Secretary of the Treasury following such negotiations as may be necessary to effect a modification or a termination of the international obligations of the United States with which the amendment would be in conflict." ;
4. WHERPLIS I have found as a fact that certain existing duties and other import restrictions of the United States of America, of other contracting parties to the said General Agreement, and of Japan are unduly burdening and restricting the foreign trade of the United States of America and that the purposes declared in the said section
350 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, will be promoted by a trade agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Governments of some or all of the other countries referred to in this recital;
5. W H E R E A S I have found as a fact that the provisions of the amendments to the Tariff Act of 1930 set forth in the second and third recitals of this proclamation are such as to conflict with obligations of the United States of America to other contracting parties
to the said General Agreement and to result in existing duties or other import restrictions of the United States of America or of other such contracting parties unduly burdening and restricting the foreign trade of the United States of America;
6. WHP^REAS, pursuant to section 3 (a) of the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1951 (65 Stat. ^ ) , I transmitted to the United States Tariff Commission for investigatioii and report lists of all
articles imported into the United States of America to be considered for possible modification of duties and other import restrictions, imposition of additional import restrictions, or continuance of existing customs or excise treatment in the trade agreement negotiations with the governments of the foreign countries referred to in the third recital of this proclamation, and the Tariff Commission made an investigation in accordance with section 3 of said Trade Agreements Extension Act and thereafter reported to the President;
7. W H E R E A S reasonable public notice of the intention to conduct trade agreement negotiations was given, the views presented by persons interested in such negotiations were received and considered, and information and advice with respect to such negotiations were sought and obtained from the Departments of State, Agriculture, Commerce and Defense and from other sources;
8. W H E R E A S , the period for the exercise of the authority of the President to enter into foreign trade agreements under section 350 having been extended by section 1 of Public Law 464, 83d Congress (68 Stat. (pt. 1) 360), until the expiration of one year from June 12,
1954, on June 8, 1955, as a result of the finding specified in the fourth recital of this proclamation, I entered, through my duly empowered plenipotentiary, into a trade agreement providing for the accession to the said General Agreement of the Government of Japan, which trade agreement consists of the Protocol of Terms of Accession of Japan to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, dated June 7,
1955, including the Annexes thereto, authentic in the English and French languages as indicated therein, copies of paragraphs 1 to 11

15. W H E R E A S , pursuant to the authority vested in the President by the Constitution and the statutes, including the said section 350 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, on October 30,1947, he entered into an exclusive trade agreement with the Government of the Republic of Cuba (61 Stat.
