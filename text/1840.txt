Third. These documents which shall be deemed to contain all the conditions of contract with the crew as to their service, pay, voyage, and all other things, shall be produced by the master, and laid before any consul, or other commercial agent of the United States, whenever he may deem their contents necessary to enable him to discharge the duties imposed upon him by law toward any mariner applying to him
for his aid or assistance. Fourth. All interlineations, erasures, or writing in a hand different
from that in which such duplicates were originally made, shall be deemed fraudulent alterations, working no change in such papers, unless satisfactorily explained in a manner consistent with innocent purposes and the provisions of law which guard the rights of mariners.
Fifth. Any consul of the United States, and in case there is none resident at a foreign port, or he is unable to discharge his duties, then any commercial agent of the United States authorized to perform such duties, may, upon the application of both the master and any mariner of the vessel under his command, discharge such mariner, if he thinks it expedient, without requiring the payment of three months' wages, under the provisions of the act of the twenty-eighth of February, eigh-
teen hundred and three, or any other sum of money. Sixth. Any consul, or other commercial agent, may also, on such
joint application, discharge any mariner on such terms as will, in his judgment, save the United States from the liability to support such mariner, if the master gives his voluntary assent to such terms, and
conforms thereto. Seventh. When a mariner is so discharged, the officer discharging
him shall make an official entry thereof upon the list of the crew and
the shipping articles. Eighth. Whenever any master shall ship a mariner in a foreign port,
he shall forthwith take the list of his crew and the duplicate of the shipping articles to the consul, or person who discharges the duties of the office at that port, who shall make the proper entries thereon, setting forth the contract, and describing the person of the mariner ; and thereupon the bond originally given for the return of the men shall embrace
each person so shipped. Ninth. When any mariner shall complain that the voyage is conti-
nued contrary to his agreement, or that he has fulfilled his contract, the consul, or other commercial agent performing like duties, may examine into the same by an inspection of the articles of agreement; and if on the face of them he finds the complaint to be well founded, he shall discharge the mariner, if he desires it, and require of the master an advance, beyond the lawful claims of such mariner, of three months' wages, as provided in the act of February twenty-eighth, eighteen hundred and three; and in case the lawful claims of such mariner are not paid upon his discharge, the arrears shall from that time bear an interest of twenty per centum: Provided, however, If the consul or other commercial agent shall be satisfied the contract has expired, or the voyage been protracted by circumstances beyond the control of the master, and without any design on his part to violate the articles of shipment, then he may, if he deems it just, discharge the mariner without exacting the three months' additional pay.
Tenth.

employed for that purpose, to lend their aid and use their exertions to that end in the most effectual manner.
Twelfth. If the first officer, or any officer, and a majority of the crew of any vessel shall make complaint in writing that she is in an unsuitable condition to go to sea, because she is leaky, or insufficiently supplied with sails, rigging, anchors, or any other equipment, or that the crew is insufficient to man her, or that her provisions, stores, and supplies are not, or have not been, during the voyage, sufficient and wholesome, thereupon, in any of these or like cases, the consul or commercial agent who may discharge any duties of a consul shall appoint two disinterested, competent practical men, acquainted with maritime affairs, to examine into the causes of complaint, who shall in their report state what defects and deficiencies, if any, they find to be well founded, as well as what, in their judgment, ought to be done to put the vessel in order for the continuance of her voyage.
Thirteenth. The inspectors so appointed shall have full power to examine the vessel and whatever is aboard of her, so far as is pertinent to their inquiry, and also to hear and receive any other proofs which the ends of justice may require, and if, upon a view of the whole proceedings, the consul, or other commercial agent shall be satisfied therewith, he may approve the whole or any part of the report, and shall certify such approval, and if he dissents, shall also certify his reasons for so dissenting.
Fourteenth. The inspectors in their report shall also state whether, in their opinion, the vessel was sent to sea unsuitably provided in any important or essential particular, by neglect or design, or through mistake or accident, and in case it was by neglect or design, and the consul or other commercial agent approves of such finding, he shall discharge such of the crew as require it, each of whom shall be entitled to three months' pay in addition to his wages to the time of discharge; but, if in the opinion of the inspectors the defects or deficiencies found to exist have been the result of mistake or accident, and could not, in the exercise of ordinary care, have been known and provided against before the sailing of the vessel, and the master shall, in a reasonable time, remove or remedy the causes of complaint, then the crew shall remain and discharge their duty; otherwise they shall, upon their request, be discharged, and receive each one month's wages in addition
to the pay up to the time of discharge. Fifteenth. The master shall pay all such reasonable charges in the
premises as shall be officially certified to him under the hand of the consul or other commercial agent, but in case the inspectors report that the complaint is without any good and sufficient cause, the master may retain from the wages of the complainants, in proportion to the pay of each, the amount of such charges, with such reasonable damages for detention on that account as the consul or other commercial agent directing the inquiry may officially certify.
Sixteenth. The crew of any vessel shall have the fullest liberty to lay their complaints before the consul or commercial agent in any foreign port, and shall in no respect be restrained or hindered therein by the master or any officer, unless some sufficient and valid objection exist against their landing; in which case, if any mariner desire to see the consul or commercial agent, it shall be the duty of the master to acquaint him with it forthwith; stating the reason why the mariner is not permitted to land, and that he is desired to come on board; whereupon it shall be the duty of such consul or commercial agent to repair on board and inquire into the causes of the complaint, and to proceed thereon as this act directs.
Seventeenth. In all cases where deserters are apprehended, the consul or commercial agent shall inquire into the facts; and, if satisfied

the discharge, three months' pay; and the officer discharging him shall enter upon the crew-list and shipping articles the cause of discharge, and the particulars in which the cruelty or unusual treatment consisted, and subscribe his name thereto officially.
Eighteenth. If any consul or commercial agent shall neglect or omit to perform, seasonably, the duties hereby imposed upon him, or
shall be guilty of any malversation or abuse of power, he shall be liable to any injured person for all damage occasioned thereby; and for all
malversation and corrupt conduct in office, he shall be liable to indictment, and, on conviction by any court of competent jurisdiction, shall be fined not less than one nor more than ten thousand dollars, and be imprisoned not less than one nor more than five years.
Nineteenth. If any master of a vessel shall proceed on a foreign voyage without the documents herein required, or refuse to produce them when required, or to perform the duties imposed by this act, or shall violate the provisions thereof, he shall be liable to each and every individual injured thereby, in damages, and shall, in addition thereto, be liable to pay a fine of one hundred dollars for each and every offence, to be recovered by any person suing therefor in any court of
the United States in the district where such delinquent may reside or be found.
Twentieth. It shall be the duty of the boarding officer to report all
violations of this act to the collector of the port where any vessel may arrive, and the collector shall report the same to the Secretary of the Treasury and to the attorney of the United States in his district.
Twenty-first. This act shall be in force from and after the first day of October next; and shall not apply to vessels which shall have sailed from ports of the United States before that time.

ART. VI. The Contracting Parties grant to each other the liberty of having, each in the ports of the other, consuls, vice-consuls, agents and commissaries of their own appointment, who shall enjoy the same privileges and powers as those of the most favored nations; but if any of the said consuls, shall carry on trade, they shall be subjected to the same laws and usages to which private individuals of their nation are subjected in the same place. The consuls, vice-consuls and commercial agents shall have the right, as such, to sit as judges and arbitrators in such differences as may arise between the masters and crews of the vessels belonging to the nation, whose interests are committed to their charge, without the interference of the local authorities, unless the conduct of the crews or of the captain should disturb the order or tranquillity of the country; or the said consuls, vice-consuls or commercial agents should require their assistance to cause their decisions to be carried into effect or supported. It is, however, understood, that this species of judgment or arbitration shall not deprive the contending parties of the right they have to resort on their return, to the judicial authority of their own country.

Manner in which the demand is to be made.
Deserters, how to be disposed of.
Power to dispose of personal property.

The said consuls, vice-consuls and commercial agents are authorized to require the assistance of the local authorities for the search, arrest and imprisonment of the deserters from the ships of war, and merchant

vessels of their country. For this purpose they shall apply to the competent tribunals, judges
and officers, and shall, in writing, demand said deserters, proving by the exhibition of the registers of the vessels, the muster-rolls of the crews, or by any other official documents, that such individuals formed part of the crews; and on this claim being thus substantiated, the surrender

shall not be refused. Such deserters, when arrested, shall be placed at the disposal of the
said consuls, vice-consuls, or commercial agents, and may be confined in the public prisons, at the request and cost of those who shall claim them, in order to be sent to the vessels to which they belong, or to others of the same country. But if not sent back within three months from the day of their arrest, they shall be set at liberty and shall not be again arrested for the same cause.

ried into effect.

acting for them, at their will, and dispose of the same, paying such duties only as the inhabitants of the country wherein the said personal property is situate, shall be subject to pay in like cases.
In case of the absence of the personal representatives, the same care shall be taken of the said property as would be taken of the property of a native in like case, until the lawful owner may take measures for

receiving it.

sideration de la nationalite du navire qui aurait importe les dits objets, soit qu'il appartient a 1'une des parties soit a 1'autre.
ART. VI. Les Parties Contractantes se sont accorde mutuellement la faculte de tenir dans leurs ports respectifs, des consuls, vice-consuls, agens, ou commissaires de leur choix, qui jouiront des memes privileges et pouvoirs dont jouissent ceux des nations les plus favorisees; mais dans le cas ou les dits consuls veuillent faire le commerce, ils seront soumis aux memes lois et usages, auxquels sont soumis les particuliers de leur nation a. 1'endroit ou ils resident. Les consuls, vice-consuls, et agens commerciaux auront le droit, comme tels, de servir de juges et d'arbitres dans les differends qui pourraient s'elever entre les capitaines et les equipages des batimens de la nation dont ils soignent les interets, sans que les autorites locales puissent y intervenir, a. moins que la conduite des equipages ou du capitaine ne troublat I'ordre ou la tranquillite du pays, ou que les dits consuls, vice-consuls, ou agens commerciaux, ne requissent leur intervention pour executer ou maintenir leurs decisions. 11 est, neanmoins, bien entendu que cette espece de jugement ou d'arbitrage ne saurait pourtant priver les parties contendantes du droit qu'elles ont, a leur retour, de recourir aux autorites judiciaires de leur pays. Les dits consuls, vice-consuls, ou agens commerciaux, sont autorises a requerir 1'assistance des autorites locales pour la recherche, 1'arrestation, la detention, et 1'emprisonnement des deserteurs des navires de guerre et marchands de leur pays. Ils s'adresseront pour cet objet aux tribunaux, juges, et officiers competens, et reclameront, par ecrit, les deserteurs susmentionnes, en prouvant par la communication des registres des navires, ou roles d'equipage, ou par d'autres documens officiels, que de tels individus ont fait partie des dits equipages; et cette reclamation ainsi prouvee, 1'extradition ne sera point refusee. De tels deserteurs, lorsqu'ils auront ete arretes, seront mis a la disposition des dits consuls, vice-consuls, ou agens commerciaux, et pourront etre enfermes dans les prisons publiques, a la requisition et aux frais de ceux qui les reclament, pour etre envoyes aux navires auxquels ils appartenaient, ou a d'autres de la meme nation. Mais s'ils ne sont pas renvoyes dans 1'espace de trois mois, a compter du jour de leur arrestation, ils seront mis en liberte, et ne seront plus arretes pour la meme cause. Toutefois, si le deserteur se trouvait avoir commis quelque crime ou delit, il pourra etre sursis a son extradition, jusqu'a ce que le tribunal nanti de 1'affaire aura rendu sa sentence, et que celle-ci ait re^u son execution.
ART. VII. Les citoyens ou sujets de chacune des Parties Contractantes, auront, dans les etats de 1'autre, la liberte de disposer de leurs biens meubles et immeubles, soit par vente, donation, testament, ou autrement. Leurs heritiers, etant sujets ou citoyens de 1'autre partie contractante, succederont a leurs biens, soit en vertu d'uu testament ou ab intestato.

Ils pourront en prendre possession, soit en personne, soit par d'autres agissant en leur place, et en disposeront a leur volonte, en ne payant d'autres droits que ceux auxquels les habitans du pays ou se trouvent les dits biens sont assujettis en pareille occasion.
En cas d'absence des heritiers, on prendra provisoirement des dits biens les memes soins qu'on aurait pris en pareille occasion des biens de natifs du pays, jusqu'a ce que le proprietaire legitime ait agree des arrangements pour recueillir 1'heritage.

Salvage payable. Duties payable in case of unloading to repair.

If any question should arise among several claimants to which of them the said property belongs, the same shall be finally decided by the
laws and judges of the country wherein it is situate. Where, on the decease of any person, holding real estate within the
territories of one party, such real estate would, by the laws of the land, descend on a citizen or subject of the other were he not disqualified by alienage, such citizen or subject shall be allowed a reasonable time to sell the same, and to withdraw the proceeds without molestation, and exempt from all duties of detraction on the part of the government of
the respective states. The capitals and effects which the citizens or subjects of the respective
parties, in changing their residence, shall be desirous of removing from the place of their domicile, shall likewise be exempt from all duties of detraction or emigration on the part of the respective governments.

ART. VIII.
The ancient and barbarous right to wrecks of the sea shall be entirely abolished with respect to the property belonging to the citizens or
subjects of the Contracting Parties. When any vessel of either party shall be wrecked, stranded or other-
wise damaged on the coasts, or within the dominions of the other, their respective citizens or subjects shall receive, as well for themselves as for their vessels and effects, the same assistance which would be due to the inhabitants of the country where the accident happens.
They shall be liable to pay the same charges and dues of salvage as the said inhabitants would be liable to pay in a like case.
If the operations of repair shall require that the whole or any part of the cargo be unloaded, they shall pay no duties of custom, charges or fees, on the part which they shall reload and carry away, except as are payable in the like cases by national vessels.
It is nevertheless understood, that if, whilst the vessel is under repair, the cargo shall be unladen, and kept in a place of deposite, destined to receive goods, the duties on which have not been paid, the cargo shall be liable to the charges and fees lawfully due to the keepers of such
warehouses.

ART. IX.

The present treaty shall be in force for the term of twelve years from the date hereof: and further until the end of twelve months after the Government of the United States on the one part or that of Hanover on the other, shall have given notice of its intention of terminating the

same.
