[56 STAT.

CONSIDERING:
One. That the American Republics have formulated at the Second Consultative Meeting the Act of Habana [ ' ] with regard to the destiny of colonies of non-American countries located in this hemisphere as well as with respect to the provisional administration of such colonies ;
Two. That as a result of the events which are taking place in the European continent situations may develop in the territories of the possessions which some of the belligerent nations have in the Americas which may extinguish or materially impair the sovereignty which they exercise over them, or leave their government without a leader, thus creating a state of danger to the peace of the continent and a state of affairs in which the rule of law, order, and respect for life, liberty and the property of inhabitants may disappear ;
Three. That the American Republics consider that force cannot constitute the basis of rights , and they condemn all violence whether under the form of conquest, of stipulations which may have been imposed by the belligerents in the clauses of treaty, or by any other process ;
Four. That any transfer, or attempted transfer, of the sovereignty, jurisdiction, possession or any interest in or control over any such region to another non-American State , would be regarded by the American Republics as against American sentiments and principles and the rights of American States to maintain their security and political independence ;
Five. That no such transfer or attempt to transfer or acquire any interest or right in any such region , directly or indirectly, would be recognized or accepted by the American Republics no matter what form was employed to attain such purposes;
Six. That by virtue of a principle of American international law, recognized by various conferences, the acquisition of territories by force cannot be permitted ;
Seven. That the American Republics , through their respective government agencies, reserve the right to judge whether any transfer or attempted transfer of sovereignty, jurisdiction, cession or incorporation of geographic regions in the Americas, possessed by European countries up to September 1 , 1939, has the effect of impairing their political independence even though no formal transfer or change in the status of such region or regions shall have taken place ;
Eight. That in the cases foreseen, as well as any others which might leave the government of such regions without a leader, it is, therefore, necessary to establish a provisional administrative regime for such regions until such time as their definitive regime is established by the free determination of their people ;
Nine. That the American Republics, as an international community which acts strongly and integrally, using as a basis political and juridical principles which they have applied for more than a century,
1 [Executive Agreement Series 199 ; 54 Stat. 2491.]

56 STAT. ] INTER-AMERICAN-EUROPEAN COLONIES - JULY 30, 1940

1275

have the unquestionable right , in order to preserve their unity and security, to take such regions under their administration and to deliberate as to their destinies, in accordance with their respective degrees of political and economic development ;
Ten. That the provisional and transitory character of the measures agreed to does not imply an oversight or abrogation of the principle of non-intervention which regulates inter-American life, a principle proclaimed by the American Institute, recognized by the meeting of jurists held at Rio de Janeiro and fully reaffirmed at the Seventh International American Conference held at Montevideo ;
Eleven. That this community has therefore international juridical capacity to act in this manner ;
Twelve. That in this case, the most appropriate regime is that of a provisional administration ; and that this system entails no danger because the American Republics do not entertain any purpose whatsoever of territorial aggrandizement ;
Thirteen . That the establishment of a special provisional regime in the present convention and in the Act of Habana concerning the provisional administration of European colonies and possessions in the Americas does not eliminate or modify the system of consultation agreed upon at Buenos Aires , confirmed at Lima, and practiced at Panama and Habana .
Fourteen. Being desirous of protecting their peace and safety and of promoting the interests of any of the regions herein referred to which may fall within the purview of the foregoing recitations , have resolved to conclude the following convention :

54 Stat. 2491 .

I

Los Gobiernos representados en la Segunda Reunión de Consulta entre los Ministros de Relaciones Exteriores de las Repúblicas Americanas ,
CONSIDERANDO :
PRIMERO: Que las Repúblicas de América han formulado en la Segunda Reunión de Consulta el Acta de La Habana, relativa al destino de las colonias de países no americanos situadas en este Continente, así como la administración provisional de las mismas .
SEGUNDO : Que como consecuencia de los hechos que se desarrollan en el Continente europeo, pueden producirse en los territorios de las posesiones que algunas de las naciones en beligerancia tienen en América, situaciones en que esa soberanía se extinga o sea esencialmente afectada, o la acefalia en el gobierno , generando un peligro para la paz del Continente y creando un estado en que desaparezca el imperio de la ley , el orden y el respeto a la vida, a la libertad y a la propiedad de los habitantes .
TERCERO: Que las Repúblicas Americanas consideran que la fuerza no puede constituir el fundamento de derechos y condenan toda violencia bien bajo forma de conquista, de estipulaciones que se impusieran por los beligerantes en las cláusulas de un tratado o por cualquier otro procedimiento .
CUARTO:-Que las Repúblicas Americanas considerarían cualquiera transferencia o intento de transferencia de soberanía, jurisdicción , posesión, o cualquier interés o control en alguna de esas posesiones a otro Estado no americano como contrarios a los sentimientos y principios americanos y a los derechos de los Estados americanos de mantener su seguridad e independencia política.
QUINTO: Que las Repúblicas americanas no reconocerían ni aceptarían tal transferencia o intento de transferir o de adquirir interés o derecho , directa o indirectamente, en alguna de estas regiones cualquiera que fuese la forma empleada para realizarla ;
SEXTO : Que en virtud de un principio de derecho internacional americano, reconocido en diversas conferencias, no puede permitirse la adquisición de territorios por la fuerza ;
SEPTIMO:-Que las Repúblicas americanas se reservan el derecho de juzgar, por sus respectivos órganos de gobierno , si cualquier transferencia o intento de transferencia de soberanía, jurisdicción , cesión o incorporación de regiones geográficas en las Américas, poseídas por países europeos hasta Septiembre primero de mil novecientos treinta y nueve, puede menoscabar la independencia política de dichas Repúblicas aun cuando no haya tenido lugar transferencia formal o cambio. alguno en el "status" de esa región o esas regiones ;

56 STAT. ] INTER-AMERICAN-EUROPEAN COLONIES-JULY 30, 1940
OCTAVO: Que por lo tanto , es necesario establecer para los casos previstos , como para cualquiera otro que produzca acefalia de gobierno en dichas regiones, un régimen provisional de administración , mientras se llega al definitivo por la libre determinación de los pueblos ;
NOVENO: Que las Repúblicas americanas, como comunidad internacional que actúa íntegra y fuertemente , apoyándose en principios políticos y jurídicos que han sido aplicados por más de un siglo , tienen el incontestable derecho, para preservar su unidad y seguridad, a tomar bajo su administración dichas regiones y deliberar sobre sus destinos de acuerdo con sus respectivos grados de desarrollo político y económico .
DECIMO:-Que el carácter provisional y transitorio de las medidas acordadas no importa un olvido o abrogación del principio de la no intervención regulador de la vida interamericana, principio proclamado por el Instituto Americano , reconocido por la Junta de Jurisconsultos celebrada en Río de Janeiro, y consagrado en toda su amplitud en la Séptima Conferencia Internacional Panamericana celebrada en Montevideo ;
UNDECIMO: Que esta comunidad tiene por tanto capacidad internacional jurídica para actuar de tal manera ;
DECIMO SEGUNDO: -Que en este caso, el régimen más adecuado es el de administración provisional ; y que este sistema no entraña peligro , porque las Repúblicas no tienen propósito alguno de engrandecimiento territorial ;
DECIMO TERCERO : -Que la regulación de un régimen provisional en la presente Convención y en el Acta de La Habana sobre administración provisional de colonias y posesiones europeas en América no suprime ni altera el sistema de consulta acordado en Buenos Aires , confirmado en Lima y ejecutado en Panamá y en La Habana .
DECIMO CUARTO: -Deseando proteger su paz y su seguridad, y fomentar los intereses de cualquiera de las regiones a que la presente se refiere, que quedaran comprendidas dentro de los considerandos anteriores; han resuelto concertar la siguiente Convención:

IV
La administración del territorio se ejercerá bajo las condiciones que garanticen la libertad de conciencia y de cultos con las reglamentaciones que exijan el mantenimiento del orden público y las buenas costumbres .
V

La administración aplicará las leyes locales coordinándolas con los fines de esta Convención, pero podrá adoptar además aquellas determinaciones necesarias para resolver situaciones sobre las cuales no existan dichas leyes.
VI

En todo lo que concierne al comercio e industria las naciones

americanas gozarán de igual situación y de los mismos beneficios , y el

administrador nunca podrá crear una situación de privilegio para sí

o para sus nacionales o para Estados determinados. Se mantendrá

XII La administración someterá una Memoria anual al organismo interamericano , encargado del control de las regiones administradas, sobre la manera en que ha desempeñado su cometido , acompañando las cuentas y medidas adoptadas durante el año en la misma región .

Primeiro Que as Repúblicas da América concluiram na II Reunião de Consulta a Ata de Havana, relativa ao destino das colônias de países não americanos situadas neste Continente, assim como à administração provisória das mesmas ;
Segundo: Que, como consequência dos fatos que ocorrem no Continente europeu , podem produzir-se, nos territórios das possessões que algumas das nações beligerantes têm na América , situações capazes de eliminar, ou comprometer de fato , a soberania que aquelas nações exercem nos referidos territórios , ou ainda de deixá-los sem Governo, criando um perigo para a paz do Continente e um estado de cousas em que pode desaparecer o império da lei , a ordem e o respeito à vida, à liberdade e à propriedade dos habitantes ;
Terceiro: Que as Repúblicas Americanas consideram que a fôrça não pode constituir fundamento de direitos e condenam toda violência, sob forma de conquista, de estipulações impostas pelos beligerantes nas cláusulas de um tratado , ou por qualquer outro procedimento ;
Quarto: Que qualquer transferência, ou intento de transferência, a outro Estado não americano, da soberania, jurisdição , posse , ou de qualquer interesse ou contrôle em qualquer destas regiões , será considerado pelas Repúblicas Americanas como contrária aos sentimentos e princípios americanos e aos direitos dos Estados americanos de manter sua segurança e independência política;
Quinto: Que as Repúblicas americanas não reconheceriam , nem aceitariam tal transferência ou propósito de transferir ou de adquirir interêsse ou direito , direta ou indiretamente, em qualquer das referidas regiões, seja qual fôr a fôrça empregada para realizá-la ;
Sexto: Que em virtude de um princípio de direito internacional americano , reconhecido em diversas Conferências , não se pode permitir a aquisição de territórios pela fôrça ;
Sétimo: Que as Repúblicas americanas se reservam o direito de julgar , por seus respectivos órgãos de Govêrnos , se qualquer transferência, ou intento de transferência de soberania, jurisdição , cessão ou incorporação de regiões geográficas nas Américas, possuidas pelos países europeus até 1 de Setembro de 1939 , pode pôr em perigo sua independência política , ainda que se não tenha verificado transferência formal , ou mudança alguma no status dessa região , ou regiões ;
Oitavo: Que é portanto necessário estabelecer para os casos previstos, como para qualquer outro que possa deixar sem governo as ditas

[56 STAT.

regiões , um regime provisório de administração até que se chegue ao regime definitivo , pela livre determinação dos seus povos ;
Nono: Que as Repúblicas americanas, como comunidade internacional que atua íntegra e fortemente , apoiando-se em princípios políticos e jurídicos aplicados por mais de um século , têm o indiscutível direito , para preservar sua unidade e segurança , de tomar sob sua administração as ditas regiões e deliberar sôbre seus destinos , de acordo com seus respectivos graus de desenvolvimento político e econômico ;
Décimo: Que o caráter provisório e transitório das medidas convencionadas não importa em esquecimento ou abrogação do princípio de não intervenção que regula a vida interamericana, princípio proclamado pelo Instituto Americano , reconhecido pela Junta de Jurisconsultos celebrada no Rio de Janeiro e consagrado em toda a sua extensão na Sétima Conferência Internacional Panamericana, celebrada em Montevideu ;
Undécimo: Que esta comunidade tem, portanto , capacidade internacional jurídica para atuar de tal maneira ;
Duodécimo: Que neste caso , o regime mais adequado é o da administração provisória ; e que êste sistema não acarreta perigo , porque as Repúblicas Americanas não têm propósito algum de engrandecimento territorial ;
Décimo-terceiro: Que o estabelecimento de um regime especial provisório na presente Convenção e na Ata de Havana, sôbre a Administração provisória de colônias e possessões européias na América, não suprime nem altera o sistema de consulta ajustado em Buenos Aires e confirmado em Lima e Panamá ;
Décimo-quarto: Desejosas de proteger sua paz e segurança, e de fomentar os interêsses de qualquer das regiões referidas e que ficarem compreendidas dentro dos considerandos anteriores , resolveram concluir a seguinte Convenção :

I

CONVENTION SUR COLONIES ET D'AMERIQUE

L'ADMINISTRATION PROVISOIRE DES DES POSSESSIONS EUROPEENNES

Les Gouvernements représentés auprès de la IIème Réunion de Consultation des Ministres des Relations Extérieures des Républiques américaines ,
CONSIDERANT:
PREMIEREMENT: Que les Républiques américaines ont formulé au cours de la IIéme Réunion de Consultation , l'Accord de La Havane, relatif au destin des colonies des pays non-américains , situées sur ce Continent, ainsi qu'à leur administration provisoire. DEUXIEMEMENT: Que des faits qui se déroulent sur le Continent européen pourraient survenir , sur les territoires des possessions américaines de plusieurs nations bélligérantes, des situations par lesquelles leur souveraineté disparaîtrait ou serait essentiellement affectée, ou une disparition de gouvernement qui serait un danger pour la paix du Continent et donnerait lieu à un état de choses où disparaîtraient le règne de la loi , l'ordre et le respect de la vie , de la liberté et de la propriété des habitants ; TROISIEMEMENT: Que les Républiques américaines considèrent que la force ne peut être la base du droit et qu'elle condamnent toute violence, soit sous la forme de conquête, soit de stipulations imposées par les belligérants par les clauses d'un traité, soit par n'importe quel autre procédé. QUATRIEMEMENT: Que les Républiques américaines considéreront n'importe quelle cession ou essai de cession à un autre Etat nonaméricain , de la souveraineté, de la juridiction , de la possession de n'importe quel intérêt ou contrôle sur une de ces possessions , comme contraires aux sentiments et aux principes américains et au droit des Etats américains de maintenir leur sécurité et leur indépendance politique ; CINQUIEMEMENT: Que les Républiques américaines ne reconnaîtront ni n'accepteront, ni directement ni indirectement, cette cession ou cet essai de cession ou d'acquisition d'un intérêt ou d'un droit sur aucune de ces régions, quel que fût le procèdé employé pour les realiser . SIXIEMEMENT: Qu'en vertu d'un principe de droit international américain, reconnu au cours de plusieurs confèrences, on ne peut permettre l'acquisition de territoires par la force ; SEPTIEMEMENT: Que les Républiques américaines se réservent le droit de juger, par leurs organes respectifs de gouvernement, si une cession ou un essai de cession de souveraineté, de juridiction, de remise ou d'incorporation de régions géographiques de l'Amérique, possédées

56 STAT. ] INTER-AMERICAN-EUROPEAN COLONIES-JULY 30, 1940
par des pays européens jusqu'au premier septembre mil neuf cent trente neuf, peut restreindre l'importance politique de ces Républiques même quand aucune cession formelle n'a lieu . HUITIEMEMENT: Que, par conséquent, il est nécessaire d'établir pour les cas prévus , ainsi que pour tout autre cas dont la conséquence serait la disparition du gouvernement de ces régions, un régime provisoire d'administration jusqu'à la proclamation d'un régime définitif par la libre détermination des peuples ; NEUVIEMEMENT: Que les Républiques américaines , en leur qualité de communauté internationale qui agit avec force et intégrité, sur la base de principes juridiques et politiques , plus que centenaires, ont le droit incontestable, pour défendre leur unité et leur sécurité, d'administrer ces régions et de délibérer sur leurs destins d'accord avec leur degré respectif de développement politique et économique ; DIXIEMEMENT: Que le caractère provisoire et transitoire des mesures prises , n'implique pas un oubli ou une annulation du principe de non-intervention qui règle la vie inter-américaine, principe proclamé par l'Institut Américain , reconnu par la Commission de Jurisconsultes tenue à Rio de Janeiro , et consacré dans toute son ampleur par la Septième Confèrence Internationale Américaine tenue à Montevideo . ONZIEMEMENT: Que cette communauté, par conséquent, a la capacité juridique internationale pour agir ainsi . DOUZIEMEMENT: Que, dans ce cas, le régime le plus approprié est celui de l'Administration provisoire ; et que ce système ne renferme aucun danger, car les Républiques n'ont aucun dessein d'extension territoriale ; TREZIEMEMENT: Que la codification d'un régime provisoire par la prè sente Convention et par l'Accord de La Havane sur l'Administration Provisoire des colonies et des possessions européennes en Amérique , ne supprime ni n'altère le système de consultation adopté à BuenosAires, confirmé à Lima et mis en pratique à Panama et à La Havane ; QUATORZIEMEMENT: Qu'il désirent protèger leur paix et leur sécurité et consolider les intérêts de toutes les régions auxquelles la prèsente Convention se rapporte et qui se trouvent comprises dans les précèdentes considérations ; ont décidé de conclure la présente Convention .
I
Si un Etat américain essayait directement ou indirectement de remplacer un autre Etat non-américain dans la souveraineté ou dans le contrôle que ce dernir exerçait sur n'importe quel territoire situé en Amérique, en menaçant ainsi la paix du continent, ce territoire sera automatiquement compris dans les stipulations de cette Convention et sera soumis à un régime d'administration provisoire .
II
L'administration sera exercée d'accord avec ce que l'on jugera le plus approprié pour chaque cas, par un ou plusieurs Etats américains dont le consentement aura été préalablement obtenu.

The Government of the United States of America and the Government of Canada, being desirous of further promoting the flow of commerce between the two countries, of avoiding double taxation and of preventing fiscal evasion in the case of income taxes , have decided to conclude a Convention and for that purpose have appointed as their Plenipotentiaries :

Mr. Leighton McCarthy, K. C. , Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of Canada at Washington ; who, having communicated to one another their full powers found in good and due form, have agreed upon the following Articles :

Plenipotentiaries.

Subject to the provisions of this Convention such items of income shall be taxed separately or together with industrial and commercial profits in accordance with the laws of the contracting States.

Determination and allocation of profits.

ARTICLE III
1. If an enterprise of one of the contracting States has a permanent establishment in the other State, there shall be attributed to such

permanent establishment the net industrial and commercial profit which it might be expected to derive if it were an independent enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions. Such net profit will, in principle, be determined on the basis of the separate accounts pertaining to such establishment.
2. The competent authority of the taxing State may, when necessary, in execution of paragraph 1 of this Article, rectify the accounts produced, notably to correct errors and omissions or to reestablish the prices or remunerations entered in the books at the value which

would prevail between independent persons dealing at arm's length. 3. If (a) an establishment does not produce an accounting showing
its own operations, or (b) the accounting produced does not correspond to the normal usages of the trade in the country where the establishment is situated , or (c) the rectifications provided for in paragraph 2 of this Article cannot be effected the competent authority of the taxing State may determine the net industrial and commercial profit by applying such methods or formulae to the operations of the establishment as may be fair and reasonable.
4. To facilitate the determination of industrial and commercial

profits allocable to the permanent establishment, the competent authorities of the contracting States may consult together with a view to the adoption of uniform rules of allocation of such profits .

ARTICLE IV

Diversion of profits.

1. (a) When a United States enterprise, by reason of its participation in the management or capital of a Canadian enterprise, makes or imposes on the latter, in their commercial or financial relations, conditions different from those which would be made with an inde-

pendent enterprise, any profits which should normally have appeared in the balance sheet of the Canadian enterprise but which have been, in this manner, diverted to the United States enterprise, may be incorporated in the taxable profits of the Canadian enterprise , subject to applicable measures of appeal.
(b) In order to effect the inclusion of such profits in the taxable profits of the Canadian enterprise, the competent authority of Canada may, when necessary, rectify the accounts of the Canadian enterprise,

notably to correct errors and omissions or to reestablish the prices or remuneration entered in the books at the values which would

prevail between independent persons dealing at arm's length . To facilitate such rectification the competent authorities of the contract-

PORT-AU-PRINCE, le 16 février 1942.
MONSIEUR LE MINISTRE, J'ai l'honneur de référer à l'Accord Commercial signé le 28 mars
1935 entre Haiti et les Etats-Unis et particulièrement aux dispositions de cet accord qui énoncent le principe du traitement inconditionnel de la nation la plus favorisée comme base des relations commerciales entre nos deux pays.
Le Gouvernement Haitien adhère fermement au principe de favoriser le développement multilatéral du commerce international sur la base de la clause inconditionnelle de la nation la plus favorisée. Toutefois, comme le Gouvernement des Etats-Unis le sait, il existe des conditions spéciales affectant le commerce entre Haiti et la République Dominicaineet qui résultent de leur situation géographique exceptionnelle. En vue de favoriser des relations économiques plus étroites entre ces deux pays limitrophes, un Traité de Commerce a été signé le 26 Août 1941 entre Haiti et la République Dominicaine . Ce Traité prévoit, entre autres, des réductions sur les taxes douanières haitiennes pour une liste déterminée de produits importés de la République Dominicaine, réductions destinées à être appliquées exclusivement en faveur de ce dernier pays .
A cet égard, j'ai l'honneur de référer à la formule contractuelle recommandée par le Comité Consultatif Inter-Américain Financier et Economique pour les avantages tarifaires à des pays limitrophes .
Dans cette recommandation du 18 septembre 1941 , le Comité Consultatif exprimait que , pour servir à un sûr développement du commerce, de tels avantages tarifaires devraient être rendus effectifs

1416

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [56 STAT.

par des accords commerciaux incorporant les réductions ou exemptions de tarif ; que les parties à ces accords devraient réserver le droit

de réduire ou de supprimer les taxes douanières sur les importations

similaires d'autres pays ; que de tels avantages tarifaires régionaux ne devraient pas pouvoir gêner un vaste programme de reconstruction

économique impliquant la réduction des tarifs et la diminution ou suppression d'avantages tarifaires ou autres avantages commerciaux

en vue du plus grand développement possible du commerce international sur la base multilatérale, inconditionnelle de la clause de la

nation la plus favorisée . J'ai l'honneur de demander si le Gouvernement des Etats-Unis, à
la lumière des considérations qui précèdent, acceptera de ne pas invoquer les dispositions du premier paragraphe de l'article VII de l'Accord Commercial qui lui permettent de réclamer le bénéfice des avantages tarifaires accordés à la République Dominicaine et spécifiquement énumérés dans le Traité de Commerce signé le 26 août 1941 , avantages qui, selon mon Gouvernement, satisfont les exigences de la formule susmentionnée recommandée par le Comité Consultatif Interaméricain Financier et Economique .

PORT-AU-PRINCE, February 16, 1942.

MR. MINISTER:
I have the honor to refer to the trade agreement signed on March 28, 1935 between Haiti and the United States,['] and particularly to the provisions thereof setting forth the principle of unconditional most-favored-nation treatment as the basis of commercial relations between our two countries.
The Haitian Government adheres firmly to the principle of promoting the multilateral development of international trade on the unconditional most-favored-nation basis. However, as the Govern-

56 STAT.] HAITI - RECIPROCAL TRADE- FEB. 16, 19, 1942

1417

ment of the United States is aware, there are special and unusual
conditions affecting trade between Haiti and the Dominican Republic
which arise out of their exceptional geographic situation . With a
view to fostering closer economic relations between these two contiguous countries, a Treaty of Commerce between Haiti and the
Reductions in HaiDominican Republic was signed on August 26, 1941. This treaty tian customs duties provides, among other things, for reductions in Haitian customs on certain imports
from the Dominican duties on a specified list of products imported from the Dominican Republic.
Republic, which reductions are intended to be applicable exclusively to the latter country.
In this connection I have the honor to refer to the contractual

formula for tariff preferences to contiguous countries recommended by the Inter-American Financial and Economic Advisory Committee.
In this recommendation , dated September 18 , 1941 , the Advisory Committee stated that any such tariff preferences, in order to be an instrument for sound promotion of trade, should be made effective through trade agreements embodying tariff reductions or exemptions ; that the parties to such agreements should reserve the right to reduce or eliminate the customs duties on like imports from other countries ; and that any such regional tariff preferences should not be permitted to stand in the way of any broad program of economic reconstruction involving the reduction of tariffs and the scaling down or elimination of tariff or other trade preferences with a view to the fullest possible development of international trade on a multilateral, unconditional, most-favored-nation basis .

I have the honor to inquire whether the Government of the United States, in the light of the foregoing considerations , will agree not to invoke the provisions of the first paragraph of article VII of the trade agreement, which permit it to claim the benefit of the tariff preferences to the Dominican Republic specifically enumerated in the Treaty of Commerce signed on August 26 , 1941 , which preferences are considered by my Government to meet the requirements of the aforementioned formula recommended by the Inter-American Financial and Economic Advisory Committee.
Accept, Excellency, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration.

OTTAWA, March 6, 1942

SIR, I have the honour to state that discussions have recently taken
place between representatives of the Unemployment Insurance Commission of Canada and the Social Security Board of the United States of America on matters of mutual interest arising under the laws of both countries .

The United States of America, by the enactment of the Social 42 U. 8. C. ch. 7;
Security Act (Act of August 14 , 1935 , c. 531 , 49 Stat. 620 , 42 U. S. C. , Supp. I, ch. 7. c. 7 (Supp. ) , as amended by Act of August 10, 1939 , c . 666 , 53 Stat . 1360 ) , has made provision for the maintenance of a Federal-State unemployment insurance programme in the United States of America . The Parliament of Canada, by the enactment of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1940 , chapter 44 of the Statutes of Canada , 1940 , has made provision for an unemployment insurance programme in Canada.
There are now in operation unemployment insurance laws in the various states of the United States of America and in Canada.
The representatives of the Unemployment Insurance Commission and the Social Security Board concluded that it is desirable that the application of such laws be co-ordinated and integrated so that duplication of contributions with respect to the same services and duplication of insurance payments with respect to the same periods of unemployment may be avoided .
In order to achieve this result, the Government of Canada is prepared to make with the Government of the United States of America the agreement which is annexed as an Appendix to this note. The agreement would come into force one month from the date of your reply stating that the Government of the United States of America accepts the Canadian Government's proposal.
Accept, Sir, the renewed assurance of my highest consideration. N. A. ROBERTSON

SIR : 1. As you are aware, on February 26th, 1942 , the Permanent Joint Board on Defence approved a recommendation as a result of which the two Sections proposed to their respective Governments :

"the construction of a highway along the route that follows the general line of airports, Fort St. John - Fort Nelson - Watson Lake - Whitehorse - Boundary - Big Delta, the respective
termini connecting with existing roads in Canada and Alaska."

Construction maintenance.

This recommendation, based as it was on military considerations and military considerations only, and having the endorsement of the Service Departments of the two countries, has been approved by both Governments .
and 2. My Government, being convinced of the urgent necessity for the construction of this highway and appreciating the burden of war expenditure already incurred by Canada, in particular on the construction of the air route to Alaska, is prepared to undertake the building and wartime maintenance of the highway. Subject to the provision by Canada of the facilities set forth in paragraph three of this Note, the Government of the United States is prepared to :

(a) Carry out the necessary surveys for which preliminary arrangements have already been made, and construct a Pioneer Road by the use of United States Engineer troops for surveys and initial construction ;
(b) Arrange for the highway's completion under contracts made by the United States Public Roads Administration and awarded with a view to insuring the execution of all contracts in the shortest possible time without regard to whether the contractors are Canadian or American ;
(c) Maintain the highway until the termination of the present war and for six months thereafter unless the Government of Canada prefers to assume responsibility at an earlier date for the maintenance of so much of it as lies in Canada;
(d ) Agree that at the conclusion of the war that part of the highway which lies in Canada shall become in all respects an integral part of the Canadian highway system, subject

(a) To acquire rights of way for the road in Canada (including the settlement of all local claims in this connection) , the title to remain in the Crown in the right of Canada or of the Province of British Columbia as appears more convenient ;
(b) To waive import duties , transit or similar charges on shipments originating in the United States and to be transported over the highway to Alaska, or originating in Alaska and to be transported over the highway to the United States ;
(c) To waive import duties, sales taxes, license fees or other similar charges on all equipment and supplies to be used in the construction or maintenance of the road by the United States and on personal effects of the construction personnel ;

(e) To take the necessary steps to facilitate the admission into Canada of such United States citizens as may be employed on the construction or maintenance of the highway, it being understood that the United States will undertake to repatriate at its expense any such persons if the contractors fail to do so ;
(f) To permit those in charge of the construction of the road to obtain timber, gravel and rock where such occurs on Crown lands in the neighborhood of the right of way, providing that the timber required shall be cut in accordance with the directions of the appropriate Department of the Government of the province in which it is located , or , in the case of Dominion lands, in accordance with the directions of the appropriate Department of the Canadian Government .
4. If the Government of Canada agrees to this proposal , it is suggested that the practical details involved in its execution be arranged directly between the appropriate governmental agencies subject, when desirable, to confirmation by subsequent exchange of notes.

REPÚBLICA DEL ECUADOR MINISTERIO DE RELACIONES EXTERIORES
DIRECCION GENERAL DE COMERCIO.

N° 33-DC-9

QUITO, a 2 de Marzo de 1942.
ASUNTO : MODIFICACION AL TRATADO COMERCIAL ENTRE EL ECUADOR Y LOS ESTADOS UNIDOS DE AMERICA.

SEÑOR MINISTRO: Tengo a honra referirme a las recientes conversaciones que se han
realizado respecto a la emergencia financiera a la que hoy hace frente el Gobierno de la República del Ecuador y, a este respecto , a algunas disposiciones del Convenio Comercial entre la República del Ecuador y los Estados Unidos de América, firmado en Quito, el 6 de Agosto de 1.938 , según fué reformado mediante las Notas intercambiadas en Quito , el 6 de Agosto de 1.938 , el 9 de Septiembre de 1.938 y el 13 de Septiembre de 1.938.
En el curso de estas conversaciones, se ha manifestado que el Gobierno de la República del Ecuador, como una medida fiscal encaminada solamente a hacer frente a la emergencia financiera que existe , encuentra necesario aumentar los ingresos aduaneros, que tan gran porcentaje del total de ingresos constituyen, en cantidades que se estiman necesarias para proteger los intereses vitales de la Nación .
Se ha considerado la posibilidad de dar fin a la existencia de ambas Listas del Convenio Comercial como medio de obviar la dificultad ; pero, ninguno de los dos Gobiernos desea adoptar este procedimiento , si es que se lo pudiera evitar. Por lo tanto , las conversaciones a las que me he referido , han revelado un entendimiento mutuo , que , concretándolo , es como sigue :
En vista de las circunstancias actuales , el Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de América no invocará las disposiciones del Artículo I del Convenio Comercial referentes a la aplicación del proyectado aumento de derechos aduaneros a los artículos importados al Ecuador de los Estados Unidos y que están incluídos en la Lista I del Convenio . Queda entendido que tal aumento se aplicará, igualmente, a todas las importaciones, sujetas al pago de derechos de Aduana, procedentes de todos los países extranjeros, y que tal aumento no entrará en vigencia, respecto a las importaciones de los Estados Unidos , antes de un plazo de treinta días , a contarse desde la fecha de esta Nota. Queda entendido , además, que tal aumento será reducido y finalmente

56 STAT. ] ECUADOR--RECIPROCAL TRADE-MAR. 2, 1942
eliminado tan pronto como la situación fiscal del Ecuador mejore lo suficiente como para justificar tal medida.
Deseo, también, aprovechar de esta ocasión para confirmar el entendimiento al que han llegado los Gobiernos de la República del Ecuador y de los Estados Unidos de América respecto a que, a pesar de las disposiciones del Artículo X del Convenio Comercial concernientes al control sobre las transacciones de divisas extranjeras que tengan relación con el comercio entre los dos países , los Gobiernos de uno y otro de éllos convienen en aplicar y administrar cualquier control sobre tales transacciones en la siguiente manera:
1. Si el Gobierno de cualquiera de los dos países establece o mantiene cualquier forma de control sobre la manera de efectuar los pagos internacionales , deberá conceder el trato incondicional de la nación más favorecida al comercio del otro país en lo referente a todos los aspectos de tal control .
2.- El Gobierno que establezca o mantenga tal control no impondrá prohibición, restricción o demora alguna a la transferencia del pago por cualquier artículo cosechado , producido o manufacturado en el otro país, que no esté impuesta a la transferencia del pago por un artículo similar cosechado , producido o manufacturado en un tercer país cualquiera. En lo concerniente a tipos de cambio y a impuestos o gravámenes sobre las transacciones de divisas , los artículos cosechados , producidos o manufacturados en el otro país , recibirán incondicionalmente un trato no menos favorable que el que se conceda a los productos similares cosechados , producidos o manufacturados en un tercer país cualquiera . Las anteriores disposiciones se extenderán también a la aplicación de tal control a los pagos incidentales o necesarios para la importación de artículos cosechados , producidos o manufacturados en el otro país . En general, el control será administrado en tal forma que no influya desventajosamente para el otro país , en la relación de competencia entre artículos cosechados , producidos o manufacturados en el un país y los artículos similares cosechados , producidos o manufacturados en terceros países.
Queda además entendido que ninguna de las disposiciones de los parágrafos anteriores 1 y 2 , o del Convenio Comercial de 6 de Agosto de 1.938 , según fué reformado , impedirá que cualquiera de los dos países adopte o ponga en vigencia medidas relativas a la seguridad pública, o que se impongan para la protección de los intereses esenciales del país en tiempo de guerra o de otra emergencia nacional.
Aprovecho de esta oportunidad para renovar a Vuestra Excelencia los sentimientos de mi más alta consideración .

REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS
COMMERCIAL OFFICE

N° 33-DC-9

QUITO, March 2, 1942.
SUBJECT : MODIFICATION OF THE TRADE AGREEMENT BETWEEN ECUADOR AND THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
MR. MINISTER : I have the honor to refer to recent conversations which have taken
place with regard to the financial emergency with which the Government of the Republic of Ecuador is today confronted and, in that connection, to certain provisions of the trade agreement between the Republic of Ecuador and the United States of America signed at Quito on August 6 , 1938 , as amended by notes exchanged at Quito on August 6 , 1938 , September 9 , 1938 , and September 13 , 1938. [ ']
In the course of these conversations it has been pointed out that the Government of the Republic of Ecuador finds it necessary, as a fiscal measure designed solely to meet the existing financial emergency, to augment customs revenues, which make up such a large percentage of total revenues , to an extent deemed necessary to safeguard vital interests of the nation .
Consideration was given to the possibility of terminating both schedules of the trade agreement as a way out of the difficulty ; but neither Government desires to adopt this course if it should be possible to avoid it. Therefore, the conversations to which I have referred have disclosed a mutual understanding which, specifically, is as follows :
In view of the existing circumstances, the Government of the United States of America will not invoke the provisions of article I of the trade agreement in respect of the application of the proposed increase in customs duties to articles imported into Ecuador from the United States which are included in schedule I of the agreement . It is understood that such increase will be applied equally to all dutiable imports from all foreign countries and that such increase will not become effective with regard to imports from the United States prior to a period of 30 days from the date of this note . It is understood, further, that such increase will be reduced and finally eliminated as soon as Ecuador's fiscal situation improves sufficiently to warrant such a measure.
I also desire to take this occasion to confirm the understanding which has been reached between the Government of the Republic of Ecuador and the Government of the United States of America that, notwithstanding the provisions of article X of the trade agreement concerning the control of foreign-exchange transactions relating
[Executive Agreement Series 133 ; 53 Stat. 1951. ]

56 STAT.] ECUADOR- RECIPROCAL TRADE- MAR. 2, 1942
to trade between the two countries, the Governments of the two countries agree to apply and administer any control over such transactions as follows:
1. If the Government of either country establishes or maintains any form of control of the means of effecting international payments, it shall accord unconditional most-favored-nation treatment to the commerce of the other country with respect to all aspects of such control.
2. The Government establishing or maintaining such control shall impose no prohibition , restriction, or delay on the transfer of payment for any article the growth, produce, or manufacture of the other country which is not imposed on the transfer of payment for a like article the growth, produce, or manufacture of any third country. With respect to rates of exchange and with respect to taxes or charges on exchange transactions , articles the growth, produce, or manufacture of the other country shall unconditionally receive treatment no less favorable than that accorded to like articles the growth, produce , or manufacture of any third country. The foregoing provisions shall also extend to the application of such control to payments incidental to or necessary for the importation of articles the growth, produce , or manufacture of the other country. In general, the control shall be administered so as not to influence to the disadvantage of the other country the competitive relationship between articles the growth, produce, or manufacture of that country and like articles the growth, produce, or manufacture of third countries .
It is further understood that none of the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 above or of the trade agreement of August 6 , 1938 , as amended , shall prevent either of the two countries from adopting or putting into effect measures relating to public security or imposed for the protection of the country's essential interests in time of war or other national emergency .
I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the assurances of my highest consideration.

[E. A. S. 249]

The Acting Secretary of State to the Canadian Minister

DEPARTMENT OF STATE

WASHINGTON

SIR :

March 30, 1942

I have the honor to refer to conversations which have taken place

between officers of the Canadian Legation and of the Department
with respect to the application of the United States Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, as amended , to Canadian nationals residing in the United States .

54 Stat. 885. 50 U. S. C., app. 330021--331158.; Supp.
Ante, pp. 369, 386, 724, 1018.

As you are aware the Act provides that with certain exceptions

every male citizen of the United States and every other male person

residing in the United States between the ages of 18 and 65 shall

register . The Act further provides that, with certain exceptions,

registrants within specified age limits are liable for active military service in the United States armed forces.

This Government recognizes that from the standpoint of morale of the individuals concerned and the over-all military effort of the coun-

tries at war with the Axis Powers , it would be desirable to permit certain classes of individuals who have registered or who may register under the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, as amended , to enlist in the armed forces of a co-belligerent country , should they desire to do so. It will be recalled that during the World War this Govern-

ment signed conventions with certain associated powers on this sub-

ject. The United States Government believes, however, that under

existing circumstances the same ends may now be accomplished

through administrative action, thus obviating the delays incident to

the signing and ratification of conventions. This Government is prepared , therefore, to initiate a procedure
which will permit aliens who have registered under the Selective

Nationals of Cobelligerent countries.
Induction procedure proposed.

Training and Service Act of 1940, as amended , who are nationals of

co-belligerent countries and who have not declared their intention of

becoming American citizens to elect to serve in the forces of their

respective countries, in lieu of service in the armed forces of the

United States, at any time prior to their induction into the armed

forces of this country. Individuals who so elect will be physically

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [56 STAT.

examined by the armed forces of the United States, and if found physically qualified , the results of such examinations will be for-

warded to the proper authorities of the co-belligerent nation for de-

termination of acceptability. Upon receipt of notification that an individual is acceptable and also receipt of the necessary travel and meal vouchers from the co-belligerent government involved, the ap-

propriate State Director of the Selective Service System will direct the local Selective Service Board having jurisdiction in the case to

send the individual to a designated reception point for induction into active service in the armed forces of the co-belligerent country. If

upon arrival it is found that the individual is not acceptable to the

Agreement by government of co-belligerent country.

armed forces of the co -belligerent country, he shall be liable for immediate induction into the armed forces of the United States.
Before the above-mentioned procedure will be made effective with respect to a co-belligerent country, this Department wishes to receive

from the diplomatic representative in Washington of that country a

note stating that his government desires to avail itself of the procedure and in so doing agrees that :

(a) No threat or compulsion of any nature will be exercised by his government to induce any person in the United States to enlist in the forces of any foreign government;
(b) Reciprocal treatment will be granted to American citizens by his government ; that is, prior to induction in the armed forces of his government they will be granted the opportunity of electing to serve in the armed forces of the United States in substantially the same manner as outlined above.
(c) No enlistments will be accepted in the United States by his government of American citizens subject to registration or of aliens of any nationality who have declared their intention of becoming American citizens and are subject to registration .

This Government is prepared to make the proposed regime effective immediately with respect to Canada upon the receipt from you of a note stating that your government desires to participate in it and agrees to the stipulations set forth in lettered paragraphs (a) , (b) , and (c) above.
Accept, Sir, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration.

The Canadian Minister to the Acting Secretary of State

No. 222

CANADIAN LEGATION WASHINGTON April 6, 1942.

SIR:

I have the honour to refer to your Note of March 30 , 1942 , concerning the application of the United States Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 , as amended , to Canadian nationals residing in the United States .

2. In your note you make certain proposals which, so far as they affect Canada, may be set forth as follows :-

(1 ) The Government of the United States is prepared to initiate a procedure which will permit non-declarant Canadian nationals who register under the United States Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 , as amended , to elect , at any time prior to their induction into the Armed Forces of the United States , to serve in the Naval , Military or Air Forces of Canada in lieu of service in the Armed Forces of the United States . Individuals who elect for service with the Canadian Forces will be physically examined by the Armed Forces of the United States ; if they are found to be physically qualified, the results of the examinations will be forwarded to the proper authorities of Canada . On receipt from the Canadian Government of notification that an individual is acceptable and also receipt of the necessary travel and meal vouchers, the appropriate State Director of the Selective Service System will direct the local Selective Service board concerned to send the individual to a designated reception point for induction into the Naval , Military or Air Forces of Canada . If, on arrival at the reception point, the individual is found to be not acceptable to the Naval, Military or Air Forces of Canada, he shall be liable for immediate induction into the Armed Forces of the United States.
(2) The Government of the United States is prepared to make the proposed regime effective immediately with respect to Canada on receipt of a note stating that the Canadian Government desires to participate in the regime and agrees to the following stipulations :-

(a) The Canadian Government shall not exercise any threat or compulsion of any nature to induce any person in the United States to enlist in the Naval , Military or Air Forces of Canada or of any other foreign Government ; (b) The Canadian Government shall grant reciprocal treatment to United States citizens , that is, United States citizens subject to compulsory military service in Canada shall, prior to induction into the Naval, Military or Air Forces of Canada, be granted the opportunity of electing to serve in the Armed Forces of the United States in substantially the same manner as that outlined above ;

1479

1480

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [56 STAT.
(c) The Canadian Government shall not accept enlistments in the United States from United States citizens subject to registration or from aliens of any nationality who have declared their intention of becoming United States citizens and are subject to registration.
3. The policy of the Canadian Government and Canadian legislation have been based on the assumption that measures applying compulsory military service to aliens should be founded upon agreement with the interested Governments. The Canadian Government is of the opinion that difficulties might arise if there were general recognition of a right to conscript aliens , implying corresponding rights in other countries to conscript Canadian nationals. The Canadian Government , however, does not wish to raise a legal objection at the present time. In view of the close cooperation between Canada and the United States in the prosecution of the war, and in view of the time that will be saved and of the other undoubted , practical advantages to be derived from the acceptance of these United States proposals , the Canadian Government is prepared to cooperate with the Government of the United States by participating in the regime set forth above, full reciprocity on all points being assured by the United States Government.
4. The Canadian Government agrees to stipulation (a) on the understanding that the United States Government is willing, if requested , to make a reciprocal promise. It is understood , of course , that the engagement set out in stipulation (a) is limited to the present case and, furthermore, that it is not intended to prevent the Canadian Government from declaring the legal liability of Canadians everywhere, including the United States , to serve in the Canadian Forces, so long as nothing is said or done by the Canadian Government in the United States by way of threat or compulsion . The reason for this reservation is that Canada may decide in the future to create a general legal liability of Canadians abroad to serve in the Canadian Forces similar to the existing provision in the United States Selective Training and Service Act imposing a liability on United States citizens everywhere. If Canada creates such a liability, the Canadian Government would not wish to exclude any part of the globe.
5. The Canadian Government agrees to stipulation (b) on the understanding, firstly, that the United States Government is agreeable to the Canadian Government imposing a liability to compulsory military service on United States citizens residing in Canada, and secondly, that declarant United States citizens in Canada , like declarant Canadian nationals in the United States, will not be granted an opportunity of electing to serve in the armed forces of the country of which they are nationals. 6. The Canadian Government agrees to stipulation (c) on a basis of reciprocity, that is , that the United States will not accept enlistments in Canada from Canadian nationals or from declarant aliens of any nationality who may be subject to liability to compulsory military service under Canadian law.

56 STAT.]

Mar. 30 , 1942 CANADA-MILITARY SERVICE- Apr. 6, 8, 1942

7. The Canadian Government assumes that the words "active service in the armed forces of the co-belligerent country" in paragraph four of your Note mean, so far as Canada is concerned , full time duty in the Naval, Military or Air Forces of Canada.
8. The Canadian Government understands that nothing in this exchange of notes will be construed as imposing any obligation on the Canadian Government to return to the United States Canadian nationals who may be deemed to be draft delinquents under United States law. 9. In order that non-declarant Canadian nationals in the United States may be informed of the conditions of service in the Naval, Military and Air Forces of Canada, National Defence Headquarters in Ottawa will give the Selective Service System of the United States copies of a pamphlet setting forth the conditions of service, on the understanding that the Selective Service System will make the pamphlets available to non-declarant Canadian nationals who are called up for induction into the Armed Forces of the United States. 10. The Canadian Government trusts that Canadian nationals who are permanent residents of the United States and who elect for service in the Naval, Military or Air Forces of Canada and are accepted by one of those Forces will be permitted to return to the United States at any time within six months after the termination of their service with the Canadian Forces.

Référant à la récente conversation relative à l'Accord Commercial

signé le 28 Mars 1935 entre la République d'Haiti et les Etats -Unis d'Amérique, j'ai l'honneur de confirmer l'entente qui en est résultée que le Gouvernement de la République d'Haiti et celui des Etats-Unis d'Amérique sont d'accord sur ce qui suit :

1.-Les dispositions des Articles I et II de l'Accord Commercial du 28 Mars 1935 n'empêcheront à aucun moment le Gouvernement de l'un des deux pays de frapper l'importation d'un article quelconque d'une charge équivalente à une taxe interne imposée sur un article national similaire ou sur un produit à l'aide duquel l'article importé a été fabriqué en tout ou en partie. En outre , les dispositions de l'Article IV du dit Accord n'empêcheront pas l'application aux cigarettes venant des Etats-Unis d'Amérique d'une augmentation de la taxe interne dans la mesure où la taxe interne est majorée sur les cigarettes nationales .
2. Rien dans l'Accord Commercial du 28 Mars 1935 ne sera

interprêté de façon à empêcher l'adoption ou la mise en vigueur par l'un quelconque des deux pays de mesures ayant trait à la sécurité publique ou prises pour la protection des intérêts vitaux du pays en temps de guerre ou autre circonstance critique nationale.
3.-Référant à l'échange de notes entre les Gouvernements de la République d'Haiti et des Etats-Unis d'Amérique , effectué les 16 et 19 Février 1942 , à propos des avantages tarifaires exclusivement accordés par la République d'Haiti à la République Dominicaine et spécifiquement énumérés dans le Traité de Commerce entre la République d'Haiti et la République Dominicaine signé le 26 Août 1941 , il

est entendu que les dispositions des notes échangées les 16 et 19 Fé-

"Sec . 350. (a ) For the purpose of expanding foreign markets for the products of the United States (as a means of assisting in the present emergency in restoring the American standard of living, in overcoming domestic unemployment and the present economic depression, in increasing the purchasing power of the American public, and in establishing and maintaining a better relationship among various branches of American agriculture, industry, mining, and commerce) by regulating the admission of foreign goods into the United States in accordance with the characteristics and needs of various branches of American production so that foreign markets will be made available to those branches of American production which require and are capable of developing such outlets by affording corresponding market opportunities for foreign products in the United States , the President, whenever he finds as a fact that any existing duties or other import restrictions of the United States or any foreign country are unduly burdening and restricting the foreign trade of the United States and that the purpose above declared will be promoted by the means hereinafter specified , is authorized from time to time-
"(1 ) To enter into foreign trade agreements with foreign governments or instrumentalities thereof ; and
"(2 ) To proclaim such modifications of existing duties and other import restrictions, or such additional import restrictions , or such continuance , and for such minimum periods, of existing customs or excise treatment of any article covered by foreign trade agreements, as are required or appropriate to carry out any foreign trade agreement that the President has entered into hereunder. No proclamation shall be made increasing or decreasing by more than 50 per centum any existing rate of duty or transferring any article between the dutiable and free lists. The

proclaimed duties and other import restrictions shall apply to articles the growth, produce, or manufacture of all foreign countries, whether imported directly, or indirectly : Provided, That the President may suspend the application to articles the growth, produce, or manufacture of any country because of its discriminatory treatment of American commerce or because of other acts or policies which in his opinion tend to defeat the purposes set forth in this section ; and the proclaimed duties and other import restrictions shall be in effect from and after such time as is specified in the proclamation . The President may at any time terminate any such proclamation in whole or in part. "
WHEREAS the period within which the President of the United States of America is authorized to enter into trade agreements under the said section 350 (a ) was extended by Joint Resolutions of Congress approved March 1 , 1937 and April 12 , 1940 (48 Stat. 944, 50 Stat. 24, 54 Stat. 107 ; U.S.C. , 1940 ed . , title 19 , sec . 1352 (c) ) ;
WHEREAS I, Franklin D. Roosevelt , President of the United States of America, have found as a fact that certain existing duties and other import restrictions of the United States of America and the Republic of Peru are unduly burdening and restricting the foreign trade of the United States of America and that the purpose declared in the abovequoted provisions of the Tariff Act of 1930 , as amended , will be promoted by a trade agreement between the United States of America and the Republic of Peru ;
WHEREAS reasonable public notice of the intention to negotiate such trade agreement was given and the views presented by persons interested in the negotiation of such agreement were received and considered ;
WHEREAS , after seeking and obtaining information and advice with respect thereto from the United States Tariff Commission , the Departments of State, Agriculture, and Commerce, and from other sources , I entered into a Trade Agreement on May 7 , 1942 , through my duly empowered Plenipotentiary, with the President of the Republic of Peru, through his duly empowered Plenipotentiary, which Agreement, including two Schedules annexed thereto , in the English and Spanish languages , is in words and figures as follows:

"Tengo el honor de referirme a las conversaciones tenidas durante el curso de la negociación del Convenio Comercial firmado hoy entre la República del Perú y los Estados Unidos de América, respecto a las relaciones comerciales entre el Perú y países limítrofes .
"Durante el curso de estas conversaciones los representantes peruanos señalaron que, aunque el Gobierno de la República del Perú está en completo acuerdo con los principios expresados por los representantes del Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de América de desarrollar lo más ampliamente posible el comercio internacional sobre una base multilateral, incondicional de la nación más favorecida , el Gobierno del Perú ha considerado necesario , en circunstancias especiales, conceder ciertas preferencias arancelarias a países limítrofes .
"Los representantes peruanos se han referido al respecto a la recomendación adoptada por el Comité Consultivo Económico Financiero Interamericano , el 18 de septiembre de 1941 , que cualesquiera preferencias arancelarias de esta índole, para constituir un instrumento destinado a fomentar sanamente el comercio , deberían ser hechas efectivas por convenios comerciales que contengan reducciones o exenciones arancelarias ; que en estos convenios las partes deben reservarse el derecho de reducir o eliminar los derechos aduaneros sobre

importaciones similares procedentes de otros países ; y que tales preferencias arancelarias regionales no deben impedir ningun amplio programa de reconstrucción económica que contemple la reducción de aranceles y la disminución o eliminación de preferencias arancelarias y otras preferencias comerciales con el propósito de lograr el más amplio desarrollo del comercio internacional sobre una base multilateral e incondicional de la nación más favorecida .

"Las conversaciones a las cuales me he referido han puesto en evidencia que existe un acuerdo mutuo , y que es como sigue:

"El Gobierno de los Estados Unidos no invocará las disposiciones del Artículo I del Convenio Comercial firmado en la fecha para
obtener el beneficio de las preferencias arancelarias que llenen las pecesidades de la recomendación mencionada adoptada por el Comité Consultivo Económico Financiero Interamericano que el Perú acuerde a un país limítrofe , quedando entendido que si el Perú extendiera tal

EXCELLENCY:

I have the honor to refer to the conversations which have taken

place in the course of the negotiation of the trade agreement signed this day between the Republic of Peru and the United States of America, regarding trade relations between Peru and contiguous countries .

During the course of these conversations the Peruvian representatives have pointed out that, although the Government of the Republic

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [ 56 STAT.
of Peru is completely in accord with the principles expressed by the representatives of the Government of the United States of America that international trade should be developed to the fullest possible extent on a multilateral , unconditional most-favored-nation basis, the Government of Peru has considered it necessary, in special circumstances, to grant certain tariff preferences to contiguous countries
The Peruvian representatives have referred in this connection to the recommendation adopted by the Inter-American Financial and Economic Advisory Committee on September 18 , 1941 , that any such tariff preferences , in order to be an instrument for sound promotion of trade, should be made effective through trade agreements embodying tariff reductions or exemptions ; that the parties to such agreements should reserve the right to reduce or eliminate the customs duties on like imports from other countries ; and that any such regional tariff preferences should not be permitted to stand in the way of any broad program of economic reconstruction involving the reduction of tariffs and the scaling down or elimination of tariff and other trade preferences with a view to the fullest possible development of international trade on a multilateral , unconditional most-favored- nation basis .
The conversations to which I have referred have disclosed a mutual understanding as follows :
The Government of the United States will not invoke the provisions of article I of the trade agreement signed this day for the purpose of obtaining the benefit of tariff preferences meeting the requirements of the afore-mentioned recommendation adopted by the InterAmerican Financial and Economic Advisory Committee which Peru may accord to a contiguous country, it being understood that if any such preference should be extended by Peru to any non-contiguous country it would be extended immediately and unconditionally to the United States .
Accept, Excellency, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration .

The conversations to which I have referred have resulted in a mutual

understanding that the United States Tariff Commission will be

requested to make an investigation regarding the import quotas now imposed on long-staple cotton under section 22 of the Agricultural

Adjustment Act of 1933 , as amended , with a view to consolidating the

existing allocations by countries into a global quota equal to the sum

of the present individual country quotas, thus allowing Peru and other countries to utilize fully the total amount permitted to be imported ;

that if such an investigation by the Tariff Commission results in a

finding of fact and a recommendation to the President of the United

1568

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [ 56 STAT.

the Agreement on the Principles Applying to Mutual Aid in the Prosecution of the War Against Aggression signed this day.
During the course of these conversations the Norwegian representatives have referred to the fact that the Royal Norwegian Government has been driven from its country by Hitler, whose forces are in occupation of the country and are despoiling its resources ; they have pointed out that the principal national asset remaining at the disposal of their Government is the Norwegian Merchant Fleet, which that Government is operating for the benefit of the United Nations in the common war effort ; that for the protection and maintenance of that Fleet, it is necessary to install armaments and other protective devices and equipment upon its vessels , and to repair damage and replace losses thereto occasioned by acts of , war and operation under war conditions ; that it will also be necessary for the Royal Norwegian Government, when the invader has been driven from its territory, to ensure the maintenance of reestablished peaceful conditions , and that, for this reason, the need of the Royal Norwegian Government for arms and equipment will not necessarily cease with the general cessation of hostilities.

The conversations referred to have disclosed a mutual understanding on the part of the Royal Norwegian Government and the Government of the United States of America with respect to the application of

certain provisions of the Agreement signed this day, as follows :

Armaments, etc., installed upon Norwe-

of such armaments , protective devices, and other equipment shall be at the expense and for the account of the Government of the United

States of America, which shall bear any risk of loss, or damage, and

shall not be regarded as giving rise to any financial obligation on the

part of the Royal Norwegian Government. Such armaments may if

found mutually desirable be manned by American gun crews.

Ship repairs under

the account of the Royal Norwegian Government or the appropriate agency designated by it.
3. The Government of the United States of America recognizes that the Norwegian Merchant Fleet not only constitutes an important contribution to the war effort of the United Nations but is likewise

one of the principal national assets of the Royal Norwegian Govern-

ment and, accordingly , that the latter Government which is operating its Fleet for the benefit of the United Nations in the common war
effort , should be assisted in replacing ships lost in the service of the United Nations. Accordingly, the Government of the United States
of America will continue to review the situation with the Royal Norwegian Government with a view to assisting that Government in a program of replacement as soon as conditions permit. The two
Governments agree that negotiations to this end should be com-
menced without delay and should be pressed to a conclusion as promptly as possible.

In the application of Article V of the Agreement relating to the tary equipment at return at the end of the present emergency of articles transferred egnendcyof. present emerunder the Agreement, the Government of the United States of America will take into account the circumstance that when the invader has been driven from Norway it will be necessary for the Royal Norwegian Government to ensure the maintenance of reestablished peaceful conditions . Accordingly, the Government of the United States of America and the Royal Norwegian Government will consider, and will consult with each other with respect to the possible retention by the latter of such military equipment as may be considered necessary for those purposes.

Agreement between the United States of America and Great Britain respecting interchange of patent rights, information, inventions, designs, or processes. Signed at Washington August 24, 1942; effective January 1 , 1942.
The Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland , in further fulfillment of the policy set forth in their agreement of February 23, 1942 on the principles applying to mutual aid in the prosecution of the war against aggression , [ ¹ ] have considered the interchange of patent rights, information, and similar matters, and have authorized their representatives to agree as follows :

ARTICLE I

Reciprocal procure ment of patent rights, etc.; availability.

Each Government, in so far as it may lawfully do so, will procure and make available to the other Government for use in war production

I, 2§§24U11-S419C. ., Sup.p "Nationals."

patent rights, information , inventions, designs, or processes requested by the other Government. In the case of the United States of America, the law authorizing such procurement and transfer is now the Act of the Congress of the United States approved March 11 , 1941 ( Public 11 , 77th Congress ) . [ 2] Each Government will bear the cost of the procurement of such patent rights, information, inventions, designs, or processes from its own nationals. In this Agreement the term " nationals" shall include all corporations and natural persons domiciled ,

resident, or otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Government concerned ( as well as the Government itself and all of its agencies) , except

natural persons who are exclusively citizens or subjects of the country of the other Government. The basic principle as to which Government shall undertake and bear the cost of procurement in doubtful cases

shall be decided in accordance with whether dollar or sterling costs are

necessarily involved. In the former case the Government of the United

States of America will effect acquisition and in the latter case the Government of the United Kingdom will effect acquisition, but each Gov-

ernment will pay the remuneration and other expenses of its own representatives incurred in connection with communicating any research or manufacturing information to the other Government.

Duration.

ARTICLE II
All patent rights so acquired shall be acquired and used for the purposes of, and until the termination of, the war only, unless otherwise expressly provided , except that contracts entered into ( for the produc-

tion, use or disposition of articles ) which cannot be terminated without

penalty, may be completed, and all articles on hand at the termination

of the war, or completed as permitted herein, may be used and dis-

posed of. Information, inventions, designs, or processes so acquired and not covered by patents or patent applications shall be acquired

upon such terms as may most expeditiously make such information , inventions, designs, or processes available for the purposes of the war, with provision, to the extent practicable, for the limitation of the use thereof for the purposes of and until the termination of the war. When the information, invention , design, or process is of a category for which the other Government requests secrecy upon security grounds,

each Government will take such steps as it deems practicable to ensure the appropriate degree of secrecy in manufacture and use. The term "termination of the war", for the purposes of this Agreement , shall mean the date when the Government of the United States of America

"Terinination ofthe war."

and the Government of the United Kingdom have ceased to be jointly

engaged in actual hostilities against a common enemy, or such other date as may be mutually agreed upon , and shall not be dependent on the date of the signing of a peace treaty.

ARTICLE III
Such acquisition by the Government of the United States of America will be effected in accordance with regular Lend-Lease procedure (or its then current equivalent) and will be financed under such program, except that other procedure may be used in those instances where no expenditure of funds is necessary.

Procedure.

ARTICLE IV
Basis of acquisition; Such acquisition by the Government of the United Kingdom will be reports. effected on the basis of written requests submitted by any authorized department or agency of the Government of the United States of
America to the British Supply Council ( or to such other agency of the Government of the United Kingdom as may be designated from time to time) . Copies of all such requests will be furnished to the Office of Lend-Lease Administration. The British Supply Council will furnish to that Office reports as to all patent rights, information, inventions, designs, or processes obtained and transferred to the agency requesting the same and the acquisition cost thereof, if any.

ARTICLE V

Where desirable each Government will sponsor necessary relationships and permit dealings between the original grantor and the ultimate user. It is contem-

plated that normally the rights obtained should , subject to the limitations contained in Article II of this Agreement, among other things, include :

(a ) The right to make, to have made, to use, and to dispose of, articles embodying the subject-matter of the patent rights, information , inventions, designs, or processes, so acquired, including the right to use and practice any of the aforesaid.
(b) Provision for securing to the recipient Government or its designees all necessary personal expert services and supplementary information.
(c) Permission to transfer, assign , license , or otherwise dispose of, any or all of the rights and privileges acquired, to the other Government, with further permission to the latter to transfer, assign, license , or otherwise dispose of any or all of the same to contractors, sub-contractors, or other appropriate designees of the recipient Government, for war production purposes only.
(d) The reservation on the part of the acquiring Government that it, and parties in interest holding under it, shall have the right at any time to contest the validity of any patent rights acquired.
(e) Whenever practicable , a guarantee by the licensor or patentee as to the validity of his patent , in respect of which the license is granted , with an indemnity against any infringement claims.
(f) Provision for the exchange of information , between the licensor or patentee and ultimate licensee, as to improvements or the results of research on the subject-matter of the license, together with the use of any patents which may be obtained in respect of such improvements, with a further provision that the like information and right to use additional patents shall simultaneously be furnished to both Governments.

ARTICLE VI

Indemnification against certain claims.

Subject to the provisos set out in Article VII hereunder, the Government of the United Kingdom agrees and undertakes to indemnify and save harmless the Government of the United States of America

against all claims asserted by corporations or subjects of the United Kingdom arising as a result of the use and practice of any patent rights, inventions, information , designs, or processes furnished by the Government of the United Kingdom to the Government of the United States of America and used by the latter Government pursuant to the

provisions of Article II of this Agreement, or arising as a result of production, use, or disposition, by or on behalf of the Government of the United States of America, of articles :

(a) Supplied to the Government of the United Kingdom under Lend-Lease or equivalent procedure ; or
(b) Embodying the subject-matter of patent rights, information, inventions, designs, or processes furnished ( or which purport to have been furnished ) by the Government of the United

(c) So produced , used, or disposed of, pursuant to a request made or authority given by the Government of the United Kingdom to the Government of the United States of America ;
provided always that the Government of the United States of America will, whenever in its judgment practicable, avail itself of any indemnity from a third party of which it shall have the benefit, in lieu of the indemnity from the Government of the United Kingdom contained in this Agreement. The Government of the United Kingdom will not look to the Government of the United States of America for any corresponding indemnity against claims asserted by nationals of the United States in the United Kingdom.

ARTICLE VII

(b) That the Government of the United States of America will not make any compromise or settlement out of court with any such claimant, without the prior knowledge and concurrence of the Government of the United Kingdom .
(c) That, in all cases in which no prior compromise or settlement of a claim shall have been made , as in paragraph ( b ) of this Article, and the claim becomes the subject of legal proceedings in the United States Court of Claims, or other appropriate United States Court, the Government of the United Kingdom will ( if it shall so request) be permitted to assist the Government ofthe United States of America in defending any such proceedings.

1605

Supplementary agreement between the United States of America and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland respecting principles applying to the provision of aid to the armed forces of the United States. Effected by exchange of notes signed at Washington September 3, 1942.

September 3, 1942 [E. A. S. 270]

The British Ambassador to the Secretary of State

BRITISH EMBASSY,

SIR,

WASHINGTON, D.C. , September 3, 1942.

In the United Nations declaration of January 1 , 1942 , [' ] the

contracting governments pledged themselves to employ their full resources, military or economic, against those nations with which they are at war and in the Agreement of February 23, 1942 , [2] each contracting government undertook to provide the other with such articles, services, facilities or information useful in the prosecution of their common war undertaking as each may be in a position to supply. It is further the understanding of the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland that the general principle to be followed in providing mutual aid as set forth in the said Agreement of February 23 , 1942 , is that the war production and the war resources of both Nations should be used by the armed forces of each and of the other United Nations in ways which most effectively utilize the available materials, manpower, production facilities and shipping space.

With a view, therefore, to supplementing Article 2 and Article 6 of the Agreement of February 23 , 1942 , between our two Governments for the provision of reciprocal aid , I have the honour to set forth below the understanding of the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland of the principles and procedures applicable to the provision of aid by the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to the armed forces of the United States and the manner in which such aid will be corre-

lated with the maintenance of those forces by the United States Government.

Ante, p. 1433.

1. While each Government retains the right of final decision, in the light of its own potentialities and responsibilities , decisions as to the most effective use of resources shall, so far as possible, be made in common, pursuant to common plans for winning the war.
2. As to financing the provision of such aid , within the fields mentioned below, it is the understanding of the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland that the general principle to be applied , to the point at which the common war effort

[Executive Agreement Series 236 ; 55 Stat. 1600.] ' [Executive Agreement Series 241.]

1606

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [56 STAT.

is most effective, is that as large a portion as possible of the articles

and services which each Government may authorize to be provided to the other shall be in the form of reciprocal aid so that the need of

each Government for the currency of the other may be reduced to a minimum .

§§ 24121-U41S9.. C., Supp . I, Ante, p. 1433.

It is accordingly the understanding of the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland that the United States Government will provide, in accordance with the provisions of, and to the extent authorized under, the Act of March 11 , 1941 , [ ' ] the share of its war production made available to the United Kingdom. The Government of the United Kingdom will provide on the same terms and as reciprocal aid so much of its war production made available to the United States as it authorizes in accordance with the Agreement of February 23 , 1942 .
3. The Government of the United Kingdom will provide the United

States or its armed forces with the following types of assistance as

such reciprocal aid, when it is found that they can most effectively be

procured in the United Kingdom or in the British Colonial Empire :

(a) Military equipment, munitions and military and naval stores. (b) Other supplies, materials , facilities and services for the United States forces , except for the pay and allowances of such forces, administrative expenses, and such local purchases as its official establishments may make other than through the official establishments of the Government of the United Kingdom as specified in paragraph 4. (c) Supplies, materials and services needed in the construction of military projects, tasks and similar capital works required for the common war effort in the United Kingdom or in the British Colonial Empire, except for the wages and salaries of United States citizens .

(d) Supplies, materials and services needed in the construction of such military projects , tasks and capital works in territory other than the United Kingdom or the British Colonial Empire or territory of the United States to the extent that the United Kingdom or the British Colonial Empire is a more practicable source of supply than the United States or another of the United Nations .

4. The practical application of the principles formulated in this note, including the procedure by which requests for aid by either Government are made and acted upon, shall be worked out as occasion may require by agreement between the two Governments, acting when possible through their appropriate military or civilian administrative authorities. Requests by the United States Government for such aid will be presented by duly authorized authorities of the United States to official agencies of the United Kingdom which will be designated or established in London and in the areas where United States forces are located for the purpose of facilitating the provision of reciprocal aid.

3RD SEPTEMBER 1942 .

The French National Committee sets forth below its understanding of the principles governing the provision of reciprocal aid by the United States of America to Fighting France and by Fighting France to the United States.

1. The United States of America will continue to supply Fighting France with such defense articles, defense services and defense information as the President shall authorize to be transferred or provided.
2. Fighting France will continue to contribute to the defense of the United States of America and the strengthening thereof and will provide such articles , services, facilities or information as it may be in a position to supply.
3. The fundamental principle to be followed in providing such aid is that the war production and war resources of Fighting France and of the United States of America should be used by the armed forces of each in the ways which most effectively utilize available materials , manpower, production facilities and shipping space. While each retains the right of final decision in the light of its own potentialities and responsibilities, decisions as to the most effective use of resources shall so far as possible be made in common, pursuant to common plans for winning the war.
4. As to financing the provision of such aid within the fields mentioned below, it is the Committee's understanding that the general principle to be applied to the point at which the common war effort is most effective is that as large a portion as possible of the articles and services to be provided by each to the other shall be in the form of reciprocal aid.
It is accordingly the Committee's understanding that the United States Government will provide in accordance with the Act of March 11 , §§24211U-.41S9..C., Supp. I, 1941 , ['] the share of its war production made available to Fighting

France. Fighting France will provide on the same terms and as reciprocal aid so much of its war production made available to the United States as it authorizes in accordance with the principles enunciated in the letter.
5. Within territories under the control of Fighting France or within the same theater of operations , the National Committee will provide the United States or its armed forces with the following types of assistance as such reciprocal aid when it is found that they can most effectively be procured in territory under the control of Fighting France.
(A) . Military equipment, munitions and military and naval stores.

(B) . Other supplies , materials , facilities and services for the United States forces except for the pay and allowances of such forces, administrative expenses and such local purchases as its official establishments may make other than through the official establishments of Fighting France as specified in paragraph 6.

(C) . Supplies, materials and services except for the wages and salaries of United States citizens needed in the construction of military

projects, tasks and similar capital works required for the common war effort in territory under the control of Fighting France or in the same theater of operations to the extent that such territory is the most practicable source of supply.
6. The practical application of the principles formulated in the letter including the procedure by which requests for aid are made and acted upon shall be worked out by agreement as occasion may require, through the appropriate military or civilian administrative authorities. Requests by the United States forces for such aid will be presented by their duly authorised authorities to official agencies of Fighting France which will be designated or established in the areas where United States forces are located for the purpose of facilitating the provision of reciprocal aid .

7. It is the Committee's understanding that all such aid accepted by

the President of the United States or his authorized representatives

from Fighting France will be received as a benefit to the United States under the Act of March 11 , 1941. In so far as circumstances will permit , appropriate record of aid received under this arrangement,

55 Stat. 31. 22 U. 8. O., Supp. I,

except for miscellaneous facilities and services, will be kept by each.

If the Government of the United States concurs in the foregoing, the present note and a reply to that effect will be regarded as placing on record the understanding in this matter./.

Tengo el honor de informar a Vuestra Excelencia que en fecha 26 de agosto de 1941 fué suscrito en la ciudad de Puerto Principe, un Acuerdo Comercial, mediante el cual, la República Dominicana y la de Haití, en su condición de países limítrofes, establecieron un tratamiento de excepción en las relaciones comerciales existentes entre ambos pueblos. El canje de las ratificaciones de este Acuerdo Comercial efectuóse en esta capital en fecha 23 de marzo del presente año .
Este acuerdo , entre otras estipulaciones, establece la reducción de los derechos aduaneros de importación dominicanos , según lista, en la cual se especifican los productos que al ser importados de Haití deben ser introducidos en nuestro país con las reducciones de los aranceles de importación dominicanos previstas en dicha lista.
El Gobierno de la República Dominicana ha sustentado siempre el desarrollo multilateral del comercio internacional sobre la base de que las naciones tengan acceso a dicho comercio en igualdad de condiciones, y de que puedan obtener, por medio de esas condiciones, las materias primas requeridas para un satisfactorio y próspero desarrollo de sus respectivas economías.
Con este motivo , tengo el honor de referirme a la fórmula de preferencias arancelarias contractuales entre países limítrofes, que ha recomendado el Comité Consultivo Económico Financiero Interamericano. De acuerdo con el espíritu de esa recomendación del aludido organismo interamericano, fué concluído entre la República Dominicana y la de Haití el referido Acuerdo Comercial.
En fecha 24 de marzo de 1942 se canjearon notas entre ambos Gobiernos, por las cuales se agregan algunos productos a las listas originalmente concertadas.

CIUDAD TRUJILLO,

MR. MINISTER:

DISTRICT OF SANTO DOMINGO, November 14, 1942.

I have the honor to inform Your Excellency that under date of August 26 , 1941 a commercial agreement was signed in the city of

Port-au-Prince by means of which the Dominican Republic and that of Haiti, in their status of contiguous countries, established a special treatment in the commercial relations existing between the two nations.

The exchange of ratifications of this commercial agreement was effected in this capital on March 23 of the present year.

This agreement establishes , among other stipulations, the reduction

of Dominican import customs duties according to a list specifying the products which, upon being imported from Haiti, are to be introduced

to our country with the reductions in the Dominican import tariff provided in that list.

The Government of the Dominican Republic has always supported the multilateral development of international commerce on the basis that nations may have access to the said commerce on equal conditions and that they may be able to obtain, through such conditions, the raw materials required for a satisfactory and prosperous development of their respective economies.
In this connection I have the honor to refer to the formula of con-

tractual tariff preferences between contiguous countries which was

56 STAT. ] DOMINICAN REPUBLIC-COMMERCIAL RELATIONS- NOV. 14, 1942
recommended by the Inter-American Economic and Financial Advisory Committee. It is in conformity with the spirit of that recommendation of the aforesaid inter-American body that the above-mentioned commercial agreement between the Dominican Republic and that of Haiti was concluded .
Notes were exchanged between the two Governments on March 24, 1942 by means of which certain products are added to the lists originally agreed upon.
As the modus vivendi concluded between the Dominican Republic and the United States of America on September 25, 1924 [ ] provided that tariff reductions which our country may grant to other countries must benefit, to the measure indicated by the principles relative to the most-favored-nation clause, like products of United States manufacture and origin , I request Your Excellency to be good enough to inform this chancellery whether the Government of the United States of America, in view of the above-stated considerations, will agree not to invoke the clauses of the agreement of September 25 , 1924 mentioned above for the purpose of claiming the benefit of the tariff preferences granted to the contiguous State of Haiti , which my Government considers to be in harmony with the conditions of the form recommended by the Inter-American Economic and Financial Advisory Committee.
I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the assurances of my highest consideration.

"Tengo el honor de referirme a las discusiones habidas en el curso de la negociación del Convenio comercial entre el Uruguay y los Estados Unidos de América firmado en el día de hoy, respecto a sus disposiciones relativas al tratamiento no discriminatorio por parte de cada país al comercio del otro .
"Estas disposiciones establecen una política que el Gobierno del Uruguay reconoce, como sus representantes siempre lo han expresado , ser necesaria y conveniente. El tratamiento no discriminatorio entre los diversos países en lo que respecta a las importaciones recíprocas, es indispensable para el desarrollo del intercambio multilateral entre las naciones . El Gobierno del Uruguay, como queda dicho , adhiere a esta concepción y valora en su vasto alcance la decisión del Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de América, en el sentido de propugnar por su restablecimiento amplio y general.
"En el transcurso de la negociación del convenio comercial, los representantes de nuestros dos Gobiernos han singularizado la importancia del intercambio multilateral, y por consiguiente de las disposiciones que precisan el principio del tratamiento incondicional de la nación más favorecida. Sin embargo los representantes del Gobierno uruguayo han expresado que el cumplimiento estricto de estas disposiciones está condicionado por factores circunstanciales extraños a la voluntad del Uruguay.
"Las condiciones impuestas con respecto al intercambio y a los pagos internacionales por los países beligerantes europeos, inclusive el Reino Unido de Gran Bretaña e Irlanda del Norte, que es uno de los mercados más importantes de las exportaciones uruguayas , deparan grandes dificultades en este sentido . Particularmente , las medidas en virtud de las cuales los excedentes en libras esterlinas a favor del Uruguay en su intercambio comercial y financiero con la Gran Bretaña no pueden ser convertidos en divisas libres , impiden, mientras dure su vigencia, que el Gobierno uruguayo extienda en su totalidad el tratamiento no discriminatorio al comercio de los Estados Unidos de América,
"Por ello, los representantes del Gobierno uruguayo han expresado en el curso de las negociaciones, que la aplicación en su totalidad por el Uruguay de las disposiciones del Convenio, con respecto al tratamiento no discriminatorio , está supeditada a las modificaciones

que puedan operarse en el convenio de pagos celebrado entre el Uruguay y el Reino Unido, y que eliminen las dificultades por él impuestas, sobre todo con respecto a la indisponibilidad de los excedentes uruguayos en libras esterlinas .
"Los representantes uruguayos, en definitiva, han afirmado la decisión de su Gobierno de hacer efectivas integramente las estipulaciones referidas en cuanto pueda el Uruguay convertir sus excedentes de libras esterlinas en divisas libres .
"Dejo así confirmadas las expresiones de los representantes uruguayos, y refirmo la aspiración mantenida por el Gobierno uruguayo, de que será posible estructurar, en un futuro próximo, un sistema de intercambio multilateral entre todas las naciones no sometido a las trabas y restricciones que impiden su mantenimiento normal y su expansión necesaria.

"Tengo el honor de referirme a las conversaciones mantenidas entre los representantes del Gobierno del Uruguay y del Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de América relacionadas con el Convenio Comercial firmado hoy respecto de las relaciones comerciales entre el Uruguay y países vecinos.
"Durante el curso de estas conversaciones los representantes uruguayos se refirieron (1 ) a la resolución LXXX aprobada el 24 de diciembre de 1933 en la Séptima Conferencia Internacional Americana reunida en Montevideo, que recomienda el estudio de una fórmula contractual, que permita la concesión de preferencias arancelarias a los países limítrofes o vecinos y, de acuerdo con ello a la recomendación del 18 de setiembre de 1941 del Comité

Consultivo Económico Financiero Interamericano que cualesquiera preferencias arancelarias de esta índole, para constituir un instrumento destinado a fomentar firmemente el comercio, deberían ser hechas efectivas por acuerdos comerciales que contengan reducciones o exenciones arancelarias ; que en estos acuerdos las partes deben reservarse el derecho de reducir o eliminar los derechos aduaneros sobre importaciones similares procedentes de otros países ; y que tales preferencias arancelarias regionales no deben impedir ningún amplio programa de reconstrucción económica que contemple la reducción de aranceles, y la disminución o eliminación de preferencias arancelarias y otras preferencias comerciales con el propósito de lograr el más amplio desarrollo del comercio internacional sobre una base multilateral e incondicional de la nación más favorecida ; y (2 ) al Convenio VIII del Acta Final de la Conferencia Regional de los Países del Plata reunida en Montevideo desde el 27 de enero hasta el 6 de febrero de 1941 por el cual los Gobiernos de la Argentina, del Brasil y del Uruguay se han comprometido mutuamente a no reclamar para sí, en virtud de la cláusula de la nación más favorecida, las franquicias y las facilidades que cada una de ellas acuerde o haya acordado a los productos de Bolivia o Paraguay siempre que estas franquicias y facilidades no se extiendan a cualquier tercer país.
"Las conversaciones a las cuales me he referido han puesto en evidencia que existe un acuerdo mutuo, y que es como sigue:

"(1) El Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de América no invocará las disposiciones del Artículo I del Convenio Comercial firmado en la fecha para obtener el beneficio de las preferencias arancelarias que llenen las necesidades de la fórmula susodicha recomendada por el Comité Consultivo Económico Financiero Interamericano otorgadas por el Uruguay a países limítrofes , Bolivia, o Paraguay, que-

The Uruguayan Minister of Foreign Affairs to the American Ambassador

MINISTRY OF FOREIGN RELATIONS

MR. AMBASSADOR :

MONTEVIDEO, July 21, 1942

I have the honor to refer to the discussions during the course of the

negotiation of the trade agreement between Uruguay and the United

States of America , signed this day, in regard to its provisions relating

to non-discriminatory treatment by each country of the trade of the other.

These provisions establish a policy which the Government of Uruguay recognizes , as its representatives have always stated , as necessary and desirable. Non-discriminatory treatment between the

various countries regarding reciprocal importation is essential to the development of multilateral trade among nations. The Government of Uruguay, as has been stated , adheres to this conception and appreciates the vast significance of the decision of the Government of the United States of America to strive for its full and general reestablishment .
In the course of negotiating the trade agreement, the representatives of our two Governments have emphasized the importance of multilateral trade and therefore of the provisions setting forth the principle of unconditional most-favored-nation treatment. However, the representatives of the Uruguayan Government have stated that strict compliance with these provisions is conditioned by circumstantial factors beyond the control of Uruguay .
The regulations imposed with respect to international trade and payments by European belligerent countries, including the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which is one of the most important markets for Uruguayan exports, present great difficulties in this regard . In particular, the measures whereby the sterling balances resulting from Uruguay's commercial and financial transactions with Great Britain cannot be converted into free cur-

rencies prevent, for so long as they remain in force, the Uruguayan Government from extending full non-discriminatory treatment to the commerce of the United States of America.

For this reason, the representatives of the Uruguayan Government have stated in the course of the negotiations that the full application

by Uruguay of the provisions of the agreement with regard to nondiscriminatory treatment is subject to the modifications which may be made in the Payments Agreement between Uruguay and the United Kingdom and which may eliminate the difficulties imposed by that agreement , especially with respect to the freezing of Uruguayan sterling balances.

56 STAT.] URUGUAY- RECIPROCAL TRADE-JULY 21 , 1942
In conclusion , the Uruguayan representatives have asserted the decision of their Government to make effective in full the stipulations referred to above as soon as it becomes possible for Uruguay to convert its sterling balances into free currencies. I confirm in this manner the statements of the Uruguayan representatives, and I reaffirm the earnest hope of the Uruguayan Government that it may be possible to erect in the near future a system of multilateral trade among all nations, free from the impediments and restrictions which prevent its normal maintenance and necessary expansion .
Accept, Mr. Ambassador, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration .

MR . AMBASSADOR :

MONTEVIDEO, July 21 , 1942

I have the honor to refer to the conversations between representa-

tives of the Government of Uruguay and the Government of the United States of America, in connection with the trade agreement

signed this day, in regard to trade relations between Uruguay and neighboring countries.
During the course of these conversations the Uruguayan representatives have referred (1 ) to Resolution LXXX of the Seventh International Conference of American States at Montevideo , approved

December 24, 1933 , recommending the study of a contractual formula for tariff preferences to contiguous or neighboring countries and , pursuant thereto, to the recommendation of the Inter-American Financial and Economic Advisory Committee on September 18 , 1941 that any such tariff preferences, in order to be an instrument for sound promotion of trade, should be made effective through trade agreements

embodying tariff reductions or exemptions ; that the parties to such agreements should reserve the right to reduce or eliminate the customs duties on like imports from other countries ; and that any such regional tariff preferences should not be permitted to stand in the way of any broad program of economic reconstruction involving the reduction of tariffs and the scaling down or elimination of tariff and other trade preferences with a view to the fullest possible development of international trade on a multilateral unconditional most-favored-nation

basis ; and (2 ) to Convention VIII , Final Minutes of the regional conference of the Plata River countries at Montevideo, January 27 to

February 6, 1941 , whereby the Governments of Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay have agreed reciprocally not to claim for themselves , because of the most-favored-nation clause, the exemptions and facili-

ties which any one of them accords or may accord to the products of Bolivia or Paraguay, so long as these exemptions and facilities are not extended to any third country.
The conversations to which I have referred have disclosed a mutual understanding which is as follows:

Ante, p. 1626.

(1 ) The Government of the United States of America will not invoke the provisions of article I of the trade agreement signed this day for

the purpose of obtaining the benefit of tariff preferences meeting the

requirements of the aforementioned formula recommended by the Inter-American Financial and Economic Advisory Committee ac-

corded by Uruguay to contiguous countries , Bolivia, or Paraguay, it

being understood that if any such preference should be extended by

Uruguay to any third country it would be extended immediately and

unconditionally to the United States ; (2 ) the Government of the United States of America will not invoke the provisions of articles Ante, pp. 1628, 1629. III and IV of the trade agreement for the purpose of obtaining the

benefit of any exchange or quota preferences accorded by Uruguay

to contiguous countries, Bolivia, or Paraguay on the understanding

that such preferences shall cease when the present world conflict shall have terminated , except as may be otherwise agreed upon by the Governments of the United States of America and Uruguay upon

the recommendation of the Mixed Commission provided for in the

The proclaimed duties and other import restrictions shall apply to articles the growth, produce, or manufacture of all foreign countries , whether imported directly, or indirectly : Provided, That the President may suspend the application to articles the growth, produce, or manufacture of any country because of its discriminatory treatment of American commerce or because of other acts or policies which in his opinion tend to defeat the purposes set forth in this section ; and the proclaimed duties and other import restrictions shall be in effect from and after such time as is specified in the proclamation . The President may at any time terminate any such proclamation in whole or in part."

WHEREAS the said Agreement was supplemented by four exchanges of notes between the Ambassador of the United States of America at Buenos Aires and the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Worship of the Argentine Republic , which notes are word for word as follows: [']

"MINISTERIO DE RELACIONES EXTERIORES Y CULTO

"SEÑOR EMBAJADOR :

"BUENOS AIRES , octubre 14 de 1941.

"Tengo el honor de referirme a las conversaciones mantenidas entre los representantes del Gobierno argentino y del Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de América relacionadas con el Convenio Comercial

firmado hoy respecto de las relaciones comerciales entre la Argentina y países limítrofes .
"Durante el curso de estas conversaciones los representantes argentinos señalaron que su Gobierno piensa promover el desarrollo del comercio recíproco entre los países de este hemisferio, especialmente entre los países vecinos , y mejorar las condiciones económicas internas por medio del fomento de las inversiones nacionales y extranjeras en nuevas industrias bien adaptadas a los recursos y posibilidades del país, y se refirieron al propósito del Gobierno argentino , de conformidad con lo arriba establecido de promover reducciones arancelarias entre la Argentina y los países limítrofes , con vistas al logro gradual de una unión aduanera entre tales países .
"Los Ministros de Hacienda de la Argentina y del Brasil últimamente han llegado a un acuerdo sobre las bases de tales arreglos , habiéndolas sometido a la consideración de sus respectivos Gobiernos. Además, de acuerdo con la resolución LXXX aprobada el 24 de diciembre de 1933 en la Séptima Conferencia de los Estados Americanos reunida en Montevideo , los representantes argentinos y brasileños en el Comité Consultivo Económico Financiero Interamericano

presentaron conjuntamente a la consideración de ese Comité una fórmula contractual que permita la concesión de preferencias arancelarias a los países limítrofes, y el 18 de septiembre de 1941 , el Comité recomendó que cualesquiera preferencias arancelarias de esta índole, para constituir un instrumento destinado a fomentar sanamente el comercio, deberían ser hechas efectivas por acuerdos comerciales que contengan reducciones o exenciones arancelarias ; que en estos acuerdos las partes deben reservarse el derecho de reducir o eliminar los derechos aduaneros sobre importaciones similares procedentes de otros países ; y que tales preferencias arancelarias regionales

no deben impedir ningún amplio programa de reconstrucción económica que contemple la reducción de aranceles, y la disminución o eliminación de preferencias arancelarias y otras preferencias comerciales con el propósito de lograr el más amplio desarrollo del comercio internacional sobre una base multilateral e incondicional de la nación más favorecida .

"Los representantes del Gobierno argentino se refirieron también a las facilidades especiales que no son las preferencias arancelarias acor-

dadas al comercio con países limítrofes y Perú con el fin de mitigar los graves efectos de la reducción de mercados de ultramar como consecuencia del conflicto europeo , y señalaron que hasta que terminen las hostilidades entre los Gobiernos del Reino Unido y de Alemania tales facilidades especiales deben continuar.
"Las conversaciones a las cuales me he referido han puesto en evidencia que existe un acuerdo mutuo, y que es como sigue: (1 ) El Gobierno de los Estados Unidos no invocará las disposiciones del Artículo I del Convenio Comercial firmado en la fecha para obtener el beneficio de las preferencias arancelarias que llenen las necesidades de la fórmula susodicha recomendada por el Comité Consultivo Económico Financiero Interamericano que la Argentina acuerde a un país limítrofe, quedando entendido que si la Argentina extendiera tal preferencia a cualquier país no limítrofe, ella se extendería inmediata e incondicionalmente a los Estados Unidos ; (2 ) el Gobierno de los Estados Unidos no invocará las disposiciones de los Artículos III y IV del Convenio Comercial con el fin de obtener el beneficio de cualesquiera preferencias de cambio o de cuotas que acuerde la Argentina a países limítrofes y Perú, sobreentendiéndose que tales preferencias cesarán cuando hubieren terminado las actuales hostilidades entre los Gobiernos del Reino Unido y de Alemania, salvo que los Gobiernos de los Estados Unidos y de la República Argentina convengan otra cosa, previa recomendación de la Comisión Mixta prevista en el parágrafo segundo del Artículo XII del Convenio Comercial.

"BUENOS AIRES , octubre 14 de 1941.

"Tengo el honor de referirme a las discusiones realizadas durante el curso de las negociaciones del Convenio Comercial entre nuestros dos Gobiernos firmado en la fecha, relacionadas con las disposiciones del Convenio que estipulan tratamiento no discriminatorio por parte de cada país al comercio del otro.
"Durante las negociaciones del Convenio los representantes del Gobierno de los Estados Unidos han recalcado la gran importancia

que ese Gobierno asigna a estas disposiciones . Los representantes del Gobierno argentino manifestaron por su parte que su Gobierno asigna igualmente gran importancia a estas disposiciones y al principio del tratamiento incondicional de la nación más favorecida en ellas

involucrado . Señalaron que este principio es la base de la política comercial argentina, que tiene por objeto el desarrollo del comercio exterior argentino sobre una base multilateral.
"Los representantes del Gobierno argentino también señalaron que la capacidad de la Argentina para dar plena eficacia a estos principios depende de circunstancias que están más allá de su control . Recientemene, la situación del comercio y pagos de la Argentina se ha agravado en grado apreciable por los controles comerciales y financieros que han adoptado los beligerantes en la actual guerra europea, principalmente el Reino Unido que es uno de los principales mercados para los productos argentinos de exportación . En especial, la incapacidad de la Argentina para convertir libremente en dólares el producto de las ventas al Reino Unido hace que el Gobierno argentino no pueda conceder un amplio tratamiento no discriminatorio al comercio de los Estados Unidos de América.
"En las negociaciones , los representantes del Gobierno argentino manifestaron, en consecuencia, que la aceptación por el Gobierno argentino de las disposiciones del Convenio Comercial relacionadas con el tratamiento no discriminatorio debe estar supeditada a las limitaciones que en la práctica las circunstancias a que me he referido imponen a la libertad de acción del Gobierno argentino . Sin embargo , han asegurado a los representantes del Gobierno de los Estados Unidos que, con sujeción a las limitaciones prácticas impuestas por el actual acuerdo sobre pagos en vigor entre la Argentina y el Reino Unido , el Gobierno argentino dará en todo momento la más plena vigencia posible a las disposiciones de referencia . Además, aseguraron a los representantes del Gobierno estadounidense que tan pronto como la Argentina pueda convertir sus saldos en libras esterlinas en divisas libres, el Gobierno argentino aplicará completamente esas disposiciones .
"Los representantes del Gobierno argentino manifestaron que abrigan la esperanza de que la reconstrucción de la economía mundial después de la guerra creará condiciones favorables que capaciten a la Argentina para intervenir en un activo intercambio con las demás

MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND WORSHIP
BUENOS AIRES, October 14, 1941 MR. AMBASSADOR :
I have the honor to refer to the conversations between representatives of the Argentine Government and the Government of the United States of America , in connection with the Trade Agreement signed this day, in regard to trade relations between Argentina and contiguous countries .
During the course of these conversations the Argentine representatives have indicated that their Government intends to promote the development of reciprocal trade between the countries of this hemisphere , especially the neighboring countries, and to improve the internal economic conditions through the encouragement of domestic and foreign investments in new industries well adapted to the resources and possibilities of the country and have referred to the purpose of the Argentine Government in pursuance of the above to promote tariff reductions between Argentina and contiguous countries with a view to the gradual and ultimate achievement of a customs union among such countries .
The Argentine and Brazilian Ministers of Finance have recently agreed on the bases of such arrangements and have submitted them to the consideration of their respective Governments. Moreover, pursuant to Resolution LXXX of the Seventh Conference of American States at Montevideo, approved December 24 , 1933 , the Argentine and Brazilian representatives of the Inter-American Financial and Economic Advisory Committee submitted jointly to that Committee for consideration a contractual formula for tariff preferences to contiguous countries, and on September 18, 1941 the Committee recommended that any such tariff preferences, in order to be an instrument for sound promotion of trade, should be made effective through trade agreements embodying tariff reductions or exemptions ; that the parties to such agreements should reserve the right to reduce or eliminate the customs duties on like imports from other countries ; and that any such regional tariff preferences should not be permitted to stand in the way of any broad program of economic reconstruction involving the reduction of tariffs and the scaling down or elimination of tariff and other trade preferences with a view to the fullest possible development of international trade on a multilateral unconditional mostfavored-nation basis .
The representatives of the Argentine Government have also referred to the special facilities other than tariff preferences which have been accorded to the commerce of contiguous countries and Peru in an effort to mitigate the serious effects of the curtailment of overseas markets as a result of the European conflict, and have pointed out that until such time as the present hostilities between the Govern-

ments of the United Kingdom and Germany are terminated , such special facilities must be continued .
The conversations to which I have referred have disclosed a mutual understanding which is as follows:

Ante, p. 1687.

(1) The Government of the United States will not invoke the provisions of Article I of the Trade Agreement signed this day for the

purpose of obtaining the benefit of tariff preferences meeting the

requirements of the aforementioned formula recommended by the

Inter-American Financial and Economic Advisory Committee which

Argentina may accord to a contiguous country, it being understood

that if any such preference should be extended by Argentina to any

noncontiguous country it would be extended immediately and un-

conditionally to the United States ; (2) the Government of the United

Agreement for the purpose of obtaining the benefit of any exchange

or quota preferences accorded by Argentina to contiguous countries

and Peru on the understanding that such preferences shall cease when

dom and Germany shall have terminated , except as may be otherwise agreed upon by the Governments of the United States and the Ar-

MR. AMBASSADOR:

BUENOS AIRES, October 14, 1941

I have the honor to refer to the discussions during the course of the

negotiations of the Trade Agreement between our two Governments

signed this day regarding the provisions of the Agreement which

provide for nondiscriminatory treatment by each country to the trade of the other.

During the negotiations of the Agreement, the representatives of the United States Government have emphasized the great importance which that Government attaches to these provisions . The represent-

atives of the Argentine Government have stated , on their part, that

56 STAT. ] ARGENTINA- RECIPROCAL TRADE-OCT. 14, 1941
their Government likewise attaches great importance to these provisions and to the principle of unconditional most-favored-nation treatment which underlies them. They have pointed out that this principle is the basis of Argentine commercial policy, which has for its objective the development of Argentine foreign trade on a multilateral basis .
The representatives of the Argentine Government have also pointed out that the ability of Argentina to give full effect to these principles is dependent on circumstances beyond the control of Argentina . Recently, the Argentine trade and payments position has been aggravated to a very important extent by the trade and financial controls which have been adopted by the belligerents in the present European conflict, notably the United Kingdom , one of the principal markets for Argentine export products. In particular, the inability of Argentina to convert freely into dollars the proceeds of sales to the United Kingdom makes it impossible for the Argentine Government to extend full nondiscriminatory treatment to the trade of the United States of America.
The representatives of the Argentine Government have accordingly stated in the negotiations that the acceptance by the Argentine Government of the provisions of the Trade Agreement relating to nondiscriminatory treatment must be qualified by the practical limitations which are imposed on the Argentine Government's freedom of action by the circumstances to which I have referred . However, they have assured the representatives of the United States Government that, subject to the practical limitations imposed by the existing payments arrangement in effect between Argentina and the United Kingdom, the Argentine Government will at all times give the fullest possible effect to the provisions under reference . They have further assured the representatives of the United States Government that, as soon as it becomes possible for Argentina to convert its sterling balances into free currencies, the Argentine Government will give full effect to those provisions.
The representatives of the Argentine Government expressed the hope that the reconstruction of world economy after the war would create favorable conditions that would enable Argentina to participate in an active interchange with other nations within a liberal system in which the barriers, which in recent times handicapped its normal development, have been eliminated.
Accept, Mr. Ambassador , the renewed assurances of my highest consideration.

BUENOS AIRES, October 14, 1941 MR . AMBASSADOR :
During the course of the negotiation of the Trade Agreement signed this day, the representatives of the Government of the United States have explained the situation with respect to the marketing of fresh pears in the United States resulting principally from the temporary curtailment of customary exports, and have proposed that the Argentine Government , during the 1942 marketing season, limit total exports of Argentine fresh pears to the United States with the object of obtaining, for the benefit of all concerned , their orderly marketing in the United States.
Taking this situation into account , I have the honor to inform Your Excellency that the Argentine Government would be disposed to limit total exports of Argentine fresh pears to the United States during the 1942 marketing season. However, the Argentine Government is of the opinion that this is a matter which may appropriately be considered by the Mixed Commission to be established pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph 2 of Article No. XII of the general provisions of the Trade Agreement.
Accept, Mr. Ambassador , the renewed assurance of my highest consideration.

MÉXICO, D.F. a 4 de agosto de 1942.

SEÑOR EMBAJADOR :

Tengo el honor de referirme al asunto planteado por la Embajada al digno cargo de Vuestra Excelencia, respecto a la posibilidad de que el Gobierno de México autorice la salida de trabajadores mexicanos a los Estados Unidos y sobre las condiciones en que tal emigración puede llevarse a cabo.

Esta Secretaría se considera, ante todo , en el deber de señalar la importancia que en los momentos actuales tiene para el país la integra conservación de su material humano , indispensable para el desarrollo del programa de defensa continental en que está solidarizado el Gobierno de México , programa en el que culmina, por recomendación muy empeñosa del Jefe del Ejecutivo , la intensificación de activi-

dades y especialmente la producción agrícola . Sin embargo, expuesta al propio C. Presidente de la República la necesidad de trabajadores que existe en algunas zonas de los Estados Unidos , y deseoso el Primer Magistrado de no escatimar la cooperación que ha venido ofreciendo al Gobierno que dignamente representa Vuestra Excelencia, en la medida que los recursos de la Nación lo permiten, se ha servido determinar que no se pongan obstáculos a la salida de aquellos nacionales

que deseen emigrar, en forma temporal, para el desempeño de los trabajos en que sus servicios sean requeridos, y que no se fijen más condiciones esenciales que las que demandan las circunstancias y las que establecen ordenamientos legales vigentes en ambos países .
Con el propósito de precisar los alcances de esta cuestión se convino, como Vuestra Excelencia sabe, en tratarla de Estado a Estado , y para examinarla en todos sus aspectos, se estimó necesaria la reunión de expertos mexicanos y americanos , que acaban de dar cima a su labor, habiendo presentado ya las Recomendaciones que formularon y que, debidamente suscritas, se envían anexas a la presente comunicación.
Han sido examinadas con todo detenimiento las conclusiones de

que se trata y el Gobierno de México les otorga su completa aprobación. Ruego a Vuestra Excelencia se sirva gestionar que el Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de Norteamérica , si a bien lo tiene, haga otro tanto, a fin de dejar ultimado este asunto y se puedan girar, en conse-

1760

cuencia, a los diversos órganos oficiales que deben intervenir en el mismo las instrucciones pertinentes y de tal modo pueda surtir efectos inmediatos el arreglo a que felizmente se ha llegado.
Aprovecho la oportunidad para reiterar a Vuestra Excelencia las seguridades de mi alta y distinguida consideración. E. PADILLA Excelentísimo señor GEORGE S. MESSERSMITH ,
Embajador Extraordinario y Plenipotenciario de los Estados Unidos de América, Presente.

A efecto de fijar las bases sobre las cuales los trabajadores mexicanos pueden ser utilizados en los Estados Unidos, y, al mismo tiempo, proveer los medios de que esos mismos trabajadores estén debidamente protegidos, se formulan las siguientes recomendaciones:

a) (2) Previa autorización del Gobierno Mexicano podrán pagarse salarios menores de los establecidos en la cláusula anterior a los emigrantes que se internen en los Estados Unidos como familiares del trabajador contratado y que, ya en el campo, sean susceptibles de convertirse también en trabajadores y que por sus condiciones de edad o de sexo no puedan rendir el promedio de trabajo ordinario.
b) El trabajador será empleado exclusivamente en el trabajo para el que haya sido contratado ; cualquier cambio de actividad debe contar con el consentimiento expreso del propio trabajador y con la autorización del Gobierno Mexicano .
c) Será considerado improcedente cualquier cobro que a titulo de comisión o por cualquier otro concepto pretenda hacerse a los trabajadores .
d) Queda prohibido el trabajo para los menores de 14 años y éstos tendrán las oportunidades de educación con que cuentan los hijos de los demás trabajadores agrícolas.

h) Los trabajadores admitidos de conformidad con estas bases pueden constituir agrupaciones y éstas nombrar libremente a sus

1761

1762

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [ 56 STAT.
representantes para tratar con los empleadores, quedando entendido que dichos representantes deben ser trabajadores pertenecientes a la atendido que dichos representantes deben ser trabajadores pertenecientes a la agrupación respectiva. Los Cónsules Mexicanos extremarán las medidas de protección a los intereses de los trabajadores mexicanos en todas las cuestiones que les afecten, dentro de las jurisdicciones correspondientes.
i) Hasta el 75 % del término para el que hayan sido contratados (exceptuando los domingos) los trabajadores mexicanos recibirán, de parte del empleador, a título de subsistencia, la cantidad de tres dólares diarios por el período que estén desocupados .
Por el 25 % restante del tiempo del contrato y durante el cual los trabajadores permanezcan sin trabajo, recibirán sus subsistencias en los términos en que éstas se proporcionen a otros trabajadores agrícolas en los Estados Unidos.
En caso de que haya aumento en el costo de vida en los Estados Unidos, será ésto motivo de reconsideración.

56 STAT. ] MEXICO MIGRATION OF AGRICULTURAL WORKERS-AUG. 4, 1942

con la debida oportunidad, sobre las necesidades que haya que satisfacer. Por su parte el Gobierno de México determinará en cada caso el número de trabajadores que puedan salir sin quebranto de la economía nacional.

PREVENCIONES GENERALES.

Queda sobreentendido que al tratarse de la salida de otros trabajadores mexicanos , no agrícolas, privarán en los arreglos que lleven a cabo las Dependencias de los respectivos Gobiernos, los mismos principios fundamentales que se han aplicado aquí a la salida de trabajadores del campo.
Se entiende que los empleadores cooperarán para llevar a cabo este arreglo, con aquellas Agencias del Gobierno Norteamericano cuyos poderes , según las leyes de los Estados Unidos de América, les permitan contribuir a la realización del mismo.
Los respectivos Gobiernos pueden denunciar el arreglo que se efectúe sobre las recomendaciones aquí consignadas , dando el aviso correspondiente con noventa días de anticipación.

MEXICO, D.F. , August 4, 1942.

MR. AMBASSADOR:

I have the honor to refer to the matter presented by the Embassy worthily in Your Excellency's charge regarding the possibility that the

Government of Mexico authorize the departure of Mexican workers

1763

1764

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [56 STAT.
for the United States and the conditions under which such emigration can be effected .
This Department considers itself under the obligation, first of all, of pointing out the importance for the country at the present moment of conserving intact its human material, indispensable for the development of the program of continental defense to which the Government of Mexico is jointly obligated and in which, by very urgent recommendation of the Head of the Executive Power, the intensification of activities and especially agricultural production take first rank. Nevertheless , the need for workers which exists in some parts of the United States having been laid before the President of the Republic himself, and the First Magistrate, being desirous of not scanting the cooperation which he has been offering to the Government worthily represented by Your Excellency in the measure that the Nation's resources permit, has been pleased to decide that no obstacles be placed in the way of the departure of such nationals as desire to emigrate, temporarily, for the performance of the tasks in which their services may be required and that no other essential conditions be fixed than those which are required by circumstances and those established by legal provisions in force in the two countries.
For the purpose of determining the scope of this matter it was agreed, as Your Excellency is aware, to treat it as a matter between States, and in order to examine it in all its aspects, it was deemed necessary to hold a meeting of Mexican and American experts , who have just completed their task, having already submitted the recommendations which they formulated and which, duly signed , are sent enclosed with this communication . [']
The conclusions in reference have been examined with all care, and the Government of Mexico gives them its full approval. I beg Your Excellency to be good enough to take steps that the Government of the United States of America may, if it sees fit, do likewise, in order that this matter may be concluded and that the proper instructions may be issued, consequently, to the various official agencies which are to intervene therein, and in this way the arrangement which has been happily arrived at may be immediately effective.
I avail myself of the opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the assurances of my highest and most distinguished consideration.

EMBASSY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
MEXICO, August 4, 1942

EXCELLENCY:
I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of Your Excellency's Note No. 312 of August 4, 1942, regarding the temporary migration of Mexican workers to the United States to engage in agricultural work, the subject matter ofwhich was presented by the Embassy some days ago.
Due note has been taken of the considerations expressed in Your Excellency's Note under acknowledgment with respect to the maintenance of indispensible labor within the Republic of Mexico for the development of the Continental Defense Program, especially agricultural production, to which the Government of Mexico is committed. My Government is fully conscious of these commitments and at the same time is deeply appreciative of the attitude of His Excellency President Manuel Avila Camacho for the sincere and helpful manner in which he has extended the cooperation of the Government of Mexico within the résources of the nation to permit Mexican nationals temporarily to emigrate to the United States for the purpose of aiding in our own agricultural production.
In order to determine the scope of the conditions under which Mexican labor might proceed to the United States for the purpose set forth above, it was agreed that the negotiations should be between our two Governments, and Your Excellency was kind enough to arrange for the meeting of Mexican and American representatives to submit recommendations which they have duly completed . Your Excellency was good enough to enclose a copy of these recommendations in the Spanish with your Note under reference .
My Government accepts these recommendations as a satisfactory arrangement, and I am authorized to inform Your Excellency that my Government will place this arrangement in effect immediately, and in confirmation thereof I attach hereto the English text of the arrangement as agreed upon.
Accept, Excellency , the renewed assurances of my highest and most distinguished consideration.

Septiembre 22, 1942.

Refiriéndome al contrato celebrado entre el Gobierno de los Estados

Unidos de América y la República de Colombia, relativo a la Misión Naval, firmado el 23 de noviembre de 1938 , modificado por el Acuerdo

Suplementario de fecha 30 de agosto de 1941 y según instrucciones recibidas, deseo manifestar a Vuestra Excelencia que el Gobierno de Colombia, de conformidad con lo estipulado en el Artículo 3º del

Capitulo II [ 7] del mencionado Contrato , desearía que éste fuera prorrogado por el término de un año a partir del día 23 de noviembre del

año encurso, dejando establecido que vencida dicha prórroga el contrato puede renovarse por períodos iguales sucesivos , de acuerdo con las estipulaciones del artículo ya mencionado .
Teniendo en cuenta la organización actual de la Marina colombiana

y sus necesidades presentes ,- el Gobierno de Colombia considera que el personal que integra actualmente la Misión puede reducirse sensible-

mente, mientras las circunstancias generales puedan indicar la conveniencia de aumentarlo nuevamente. En tal virtud la Dirección

General de la Marina Colombiana propondrá por intermedio del señor Jefe de la Misión algunas reducciones en el personal que es de esperarse

merezcan el asentimiento del Navy Department.

De la manera más atenta ruego a Vuestra Excelencia dejarme saber la conformidad o reparos del Gobierno de los Estados Unidos a las anteriores sugestiones.

MR. SECRETARY :

EMBASSY OF COLOMBIA, WASHINGTON,
September 22, 1942.

With reference to the contract concluded between the Government of the United States of America and the Republic of Colombia concerning the naval mission , signed November 23 , 1938 [ ] and amended by the supplementary agreement dated August 30 , 1941 , [ 2] and acting on instructions received , I wish to inform Your Excellency that, in accordance with the provisions of article 3 of chapter II [I] of the aforesaid contract, the Government of Colombia would like to have the contract extended for the period of one year from November 23 of the current year, it being provided that, upon the expiration of the said extension, the contract can be renewed for successive equal periods in conformity with the terms of the article mentioned above.
Taking into account the existing organization of the Colombian Navy and its present needs, the Government of Colombia considers that the personnel now comprising the mission may be decidedly reduced, while general circumstances may later suggest the advisability of increasing it . Accordingly , the office of the director general of the Colombian Navy, through the intermediary of the chief of the mission, will propose certain reductions in personnel which it is hoped will win the approval of the Navy Department .
I most respectfully request Your Excellency to let me know of the agreement or comments of the Government of the United States with regard to the above suggestions .
I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the assurances of my highest and most distinguished consideration.

DEPARTMENT OF STATE WASHINGTON November 30, 1942
SIR: I have the honor to set forth below my understanding of the con-
clusions reached in conversations which have taken place from time to time during the past year between representatives of the Government of the United States and the Government of Canada with regard to post-war economic settlements.
Our two Governments are engaged in a cooperative undertaking, together with every other nation or people of like mind , to the end of laying the bases of a just and enduring world peace securing order under law to themselves and all nations. They have agreed to provide mutual aid both in defense and in economic matters through the Ogdensburg and Hyde Park Agreements and subsequent arrangements. They are in agreement that post-war settlements must be such as to promote mutually advantageous economic relations between them and the betterment of world-wide economic relations .
To that end the Governments of the United States of America and of Canada are prepared to cooperate in formulating a program of agreed action, open to participation by all other countries of like mind, directed to the expansion, by appropriate international and domestic measures, of production, employment, and the exchange and consumption of goods, which are the material foundations of the liberty and welfare of all peoples ; to the elimination of all forms of discriminatory treatment in international commerce, and to the reduction of tariffs and other trade barriers ; and, in general, to the attainment of all the economic objectives set forth in the Joint Declaration made on August 14 , 1941 , by the President of the United States of America and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom . [']
Our Governments have in large measure similar interests in post-war international economic policy . They undertake to enter at an early convenient date into conversations between themselves and with representatives of other United Nations with a view to determining, in the light of governing economic conditions, the best means of attaining the above-stated objectives by agreed action on the part of our two Governments and other like-minded Governments. In the conversations to be undertaken between the Governments of the

If the Government of Canada concurs in the foregoing statement of conclusions, I would suggest that the present note and your reply to that effect should be regarded as placing on record the understanding of our two Governments in this matter.

Agreement between the United States of America and Mexico respecting rehabilitation of certain Mexican national railways. Effected by exchange of notes signed at Mexico City November 18, 1942.

The Mexican Minister ofForeign Affairs to the American Ambassador

SECRETARIA DE RELACIONES EXTERIORES ESTADOS UNIDOS MEXICANOS MEXICO

59430

MÉXICO, 18 de noviembre de 1942.

SEÑOR EMBAJADOR :

De conformidad con la Resolución II de la Tercera Reunión de

Consulta de los Ministros de Relaciones Exteriores de las Repúblicas Americanas, celebrada en Río de Janeiro del 15 al 28 de enero del corriente año, el Gobierno de México ha realizado todos los esfuerzos

que han estado a su alcance para efectuar la movilización de los recursos económicos de la República, particularmente en lo que concierne a la producción de materiales estratégicos necesarios para la defensa del Hemisferio. A este respecto , me complazco en informar a Vuestra Excelencia que dicha producción se está llevando a cabo con un ritmo cada vez más acelerado , pues es el firme propósito de México unir su acción a la de las Naciones Unidas hasta alcanzar la victoria definitiva

en contra de las Potencias del Eje.

De ahí que se hayan celebrado arreglos mediante los cuales México proporciona a los Estados Unidos de América el excedente exportable de una larga lista de productos esenciales.
Tengo la satisfacción, asimismo, de manifestar a Vuestra Excelencia, que la economía mexicana ha reaccionado favorablemente a la tensión, cada vez mayor, a que se ha visto sujeta como consecuencia de este aumento de la producción, así como de que existen indicios que permiten suponer que los materiales que serán proporcionados en 1943 excederán, en mucho, a las cantidades que han sido suministradas durante el corriente año.

Por desgracia, la capacidad que tiene México de producir los artículos que con tanta urgencia se necesitan , es superior a las posibilidades del sistema de transportes mexicano para conducirlos desde las minas, campos o bosques de que se extraen o se producen , hasta los lugares en donde se exportan, se manufacturan o se consumen .
El peso que actualmente soportan los Ferrocarriles Nacionales supera, con mucho , al límite máximo de carga que razonablemente se hubiera esperado que los mismos acarrearan en tiempo de paz . Si las Naciones Unidas en general, y México y los Estados Unidos de América en particular, han de cosechar, en toda su amplitud, el beneficio de nuestro esfuerzo común, es necesario que se tomen medidas

56 STAT. ]

MEXICO- RAILWAYS- NOV. 18, 1942

rápidas y efectivas para que los Ferrocarriles Nacionales de México estén en condiciones de transportar una carga de tiempo de guerra, muy superior en volumen a la que actualmente pueden mover.
En síntesis, el asunto de los transportes, es, por hoy, la verdadera clave del programa méxico-americano de producción conjunta y de cooperación económica en la prosecución de la guerra .
En mi concepto, la mejor prueba de que el Gobierno de los Estados Unidos reconoce la importancia fundamental de esta cuestión de transportes, la constituye la acuciosa atención que Vuestra Excelencia le ha dado personalmente, así como la actitud de su Gobierno al enviar a México, por indicaciones del mío, una misión de ferrocarrileros técnicos para que pongan el fruto de su experiencia al servicio de los funcionarios de los Ferrocarriles Mexicanos, con la mira de mejorar las condiciones de operación y de mantenimiento de los mismos, así como para expeditar la corriente del tráfico .
Sin embargo, para que nuestros esfuerzos sean totalmente coronados por el éxito deseable, urge realizar diversas mejoras básicas en las líneas mismas, en su equipo y en su fuerza motriz. A este respecto , resulta indispensable la colaboración tanto del Gobierno como de la industria de los Estados Unidos de América.
Estimo, asimismo, que debería mejorarse el manejo de los Ferrocarriles, a fin de obtener la eficiencia óptima en la utilización de los recursos ya existentes y de aquellos que puedan obtenerse.
Mi Gobierno, en consecuencia, vería con agrado que el de los Estados Unidos de América considerara posible el fortalecimiento de la actual misión de técnicos ferrocarrileros, incluyendo en ella por un término de seis meses- -o por un lapso mayor, que se determinaría oficialmente mediante un canje de notas al fenecer el plazo aquí previsto a un funcionario de alta categoría y con amplios conocimientos en esta materia ; así como a un número limitado de especialistas que lo secundaran en la realización de un examen com-
pleto de los Ferrocarriles Nacionales de México y que, igualmente proporcionaran a los mismos el resultado de sus investigaciones y los auxiliaran con sus consejos.
Deseo asegurar a Vuestra Excelencia que el Gobierno de México, por su parte, procurará que se tomen las medidas necesarias desde el punto de vista de la organización y del funcionamiento de los Ferrocarriles Nacionales-para obtener la máxima eficiencia. Sobre el particular se recibirán con agrado las sugestiones de la misión ferrocarrilera norteamericana.
Aprovecho la oportunidad para renovar a Vuestra Excelencia el testimonio de mi más alta y distinguida consideración.

MR. AMBASSADOR :
In conformity with resolution II of the Third Consultative Meeting of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the American Republics held at Rio de Janeiro from January 15 to 28 of the present year, the Mexican Government has made every effort within its power to bring about the mobilization of the economic resources of the Republic, particularly with respect to the production of strategic materials necessary for the defense of the hemisphere. In this regard , I am pleased to inform Your Excellency that such production is being achieved at a constantly accelerated pace, for it is the firm intention of Mexico to unite its action with that of the United Nations so as to attain a definitive victory over the Axis powers.
For this purpose agreements have been concluded through which Mexico furnishes to the United States its exportable surplus of a long list of essential products.
I have the pleasure, likewise, of informing Your Excellency that Mexican economy has reacted favorably to the constantly increasing strain to which it has been subjected as a consequence of this increase in production and also that there are indications which permit the assumption that the materials which will be furnished in 1943 will exceed by far the quantities which have been made available during the current year.
Unfortunately, Mexico's capacity to produce the articles which are so urgently needed is greater than the possibilities of the Mexican system of transportation to carry them from the mines, fields, or forests where they are extracted or produced to the places where they are exported, manufactured , or consumed .
The burden which is now being borne by the national railways surpasses by far the maximum freight limit which it could reasonably have been expected that they would carry in time of peace. If the United Nations in general, and Mexico and the United States in particular, are to benefit to the maximum by our common effort, it will be necessary for prompt and effective measures to be taken in order that the national railways of Mexico may be in a position to transport a wartime load much larger in volume than that which they can move at present .
In brief, the matter of transportation is today the real key to the Mexican-American program of joint production and economic cooperation in the prosecution of the war.
In my opinion the best proof that the Government of the United States recognizes the basic importance of this question of transportation is the careful 1 attention which Your Excellency has personally given to it, as well as the attitude of your Government in sending to Mexico, at the suggestion of my Government, a mission of expert rail-

MEXICO-RAILWAYS- NOV. 18, 1942

road men who will put the fruit of their experience at the service of the officials of the Mexican railways for the purpose of improving

conditions of operation and maintenance thereof, and to expedite the flow of traffic.

However, in order that our efforts may be crowned with the desired success, it is urgent that basic improvements be effected in the lines

themselves, in their equipment, and in their motive power. For this, the collaboration of the Government and of the industry of the United States of America is absolutely necessary.

I also think that the operation of the railways should be improved in order to obtain the greatest efficiency in the utilization of the resources already existing and of those which may be obtained .
My Government would, accordingly, be gratified if the Government of the United States of America would consider it possible to

strengthen the present mission of railway experts by including therein for a period of six months-or for a longer time, which would be determined officially by means of an exchange of notes at the expiration of the period here provided--a high-ranking official with wide knowledge of this subject ; also a limited number of specialists who could assist him in making a complete study of the national railways of

Mexico, who could likewise make available to the railways the results of their investigations, and who could aid them with their advice.
I desire to assure Your Excellency that the Government of Mexico

will, on its part, see that the necessary steps are taken-from the point of view of the organization and operation of the national railways- to obtain maximum efficiency. With regard to this, it would gratefully receive the suggestions of the American railway mission.

I take the opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the assurance of

my highest and most distinguished consideration.

EMBASSY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
Mexico, November 18, 1942

EXCELLENCY :

I acknowledge with appreciation Your Excellency's cordial note of November 18, 1942, outlining the constructive work which the Government of Mexico has accomplished in implementing Resolution II of the Third Meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the American republics at Rio de Janeiro through the mobilization of its economic resources, particularly in the production of strategic materials essential for the defense of the hemisphere. Your Excellency has indi-

1827

1828

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [56 STAT.

cated that the production of Mexico of materials for use in the prose-

cution of the war in which both of our countries are now engaged

is being pressed to the limit , but you appropriately point out that

unless certain basic changes and improvements are made in the struc-

ture and operation of the Mexican National Railways, these lines will

not be able to carry the unusual war time peak load which is now and

which will be increasingly placed upon them. It is made clear that

unless this situation is promptly corrected , the war interests of our two countries and of the other United Nations will suffer. Your

Excellency refers to the joint efforts to improve the situation which

have already been made through the cooperation of our two governments and requests that this collaboration be extended materially.

The Government of the United States is in full accord with the

thoughts expressed in Your Excellency's note under acknowledgment, and desires promptly to extend the added measure of collaboration which is essential to solve our mutual problems. Agencies

of the Government of the United States have agreed to purchase

from Mexican producers extensive quantities of a long list of strate-

gic commodities. These are materials which are urgently needed by the United States in providing raw materials for the manufacture

of war equipment for its own forces, for those of Mexico and for those of the other United Nations. Were it not for the augmented

strain being placed on the Mexican National Railways because of

United States purchases of strategic materials for its Armed Forces, the extensive rehabilitation of certain parts of the system and the

furnishing of additional technical assistance and labor would not

be necessary for the normal needs of the Railway Lines. My Gov-

ernment considers that it would not be fair to expect Mexico to bear

this disproportionate burden. Consequently, my Government is prepared to pay its equitable share of the cost of the improvements which must be made in order that the materials in question may be

transported to American War Plants.

I have noted with gratification that, in consideration of the assist-

ance by my Government, the Mexican Government will on its part see to it that there are taken, from an organizational and operating

point of view, all measures necessary to achieve optimum efficiency

of the Mexican National Railways and that in this connection it

Rehabilitation measures by U. S.

will welcome the suggestions and advice of the United States Railway Mission.
It is my understanding, from the informal conversations thus far

held on the subject, that it will be acceptable to the Mexican Govern-

ment if my Government undertakes, through the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs, the following measures of

rehabilitation on certain sections of the Mexican Railways :

1. The lines to be covered are :

(a) Main line extending south from United States border at Laredo, Texas, via Monterrey- Saltillo- San Luis Potosi to Mexico ;
(b ) East-West line from Torreón via Paredón to Monterrey ; (c) Main line southward from Cordoba and Puerto Mexico via

56 STAT. ]

MEXICO-RAILWAYS - NOV. 18, 1942

1829

Jesus Carranza and Ixtepec through Suchiate on the Guatemalan border ;
(d ) Line from Chihuahua to Torreón.

2. To bear the cost of all materials and equipment which the Mexi-

can Government shall agree with the United States Railway Mission to be necessary for the rehabilitation of the aforedescribed lines, and

which material and equipment must be obtained in the United States ;

3. To pay for such rails and fastenings produced in Mexico and agreed between the Mexican Government and the United States

Railway Mission to be necessary for this same undertaking ; 4. To furnish without cost to Mexico the United States technicians

agreed between the Mexican Government and the United States

Railway Mission to be necessary ;

5. To bear the cost of repairing in the United States such Mexican

National Railways locomotives and other equipment which shall be mutually agreed upon shall be sent to the United States for repair under this particular rehabilitation program ;

6. To bear the cost of such additional Mexican road gangs as the

Mexican Government and the Railway Mission mutually agree are

necessary to put into adequate operating condition the road -bed of

the lines aforementioned . Expenditures for this purpose will , of

course, be ones of a character which the Mexican National Railways

could not be expected to bear for normal maintenance purposes.

I am confident that it will be

appreciated that for

and

accounting reasons it is necessary that the expenditures which the

Governments of the United States and Mexico agree are desirable

be first approved by the Chief of the United States Railway Mission in Mexico City so that he can certify to the appropriate agency of my Government that in his judgment the expenditures are necessary at

a given time and in the amount stipulated . I have every confidence

that there will be at no time major differences of opinion concerning the time or extent of aid which cannot be resolved by the frank and

friendly consultative procedure which has so happily characterized

the relationships between our two Governments. In addition to the materials and equipment, which in the opinion
of the two Governments it will be necessary to secure from the United

States, there will undoubtedly be equipment and materials which the

facilities of Mexican industry can supply, which would be furnished

for the rehabilitation program by the Mexican Government.

My Government fully agrees with the view of the Mexican Gov-

ernment that this rehabilitation program must go forward with

optimum rapidity unless our joint war efforts are to suffer.

I avail myself of this occasion to renew to Your Excellency the assurances of my highest and most distinguished consideration .

NOVEMBER 10th , 1941.

SIR : I have the honour, on the instructions of my Government, to en-
quire whether the Government of the United States would agree to a temporary raising of the level of Lake St. Francis during low water periods, for the reasons and in the circumstances hereinafter set out :
1. The Beauharnois Light, Heat and Power Company has for some years, under the authority of the Parliament and Government of Canada, diverted water from Lake St. Francis for the development of hydro-electric power.
2. In order to conserve the supply of power in the lower St. Lawrence, which is needed to continue the existing export of power for aluminum production at Massena, New York, the Company have asked the Canadian Government for authority to maintain the level of Lake St. Francis at 152.0 during low water periods, subject to the maintenance of the normal regimen of the Lake for levels above that elevation.
3. During these periods the water level of the Lake has fallen to 150.0 and may even fall to a lower level, whereas the mean level of the Lake is 151.7 and the normal high water 154.0. Extreme high water may go to above elevation 155.75.
4. To provide for the maintenance of the Lake level, the Company is presently installing a temporary dam to partially close the existing gap at the head of the Coteau Rapids , and have in contemplation for next season the construction of a permanent dam to close the gap completely, but this will not assure their output during low water periods unless they are permitted to maintain the Lake level at 152.0 as above . The regulation of the level of the Lake to 152.0 will not only be of benefit to the Beauharnois output in this vital period but will assure continuous 14 ft. depth

1834

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [56 STAT.
for navigation in the Cornwall Canal , and may maintain more satisfactory shore conditions during low water periods. 5. The proposal would result in an increase, in low water periods, in the natural levels on the United States side of the St. Lawrence River near the head of Lake St. Francis.
In view of the importance to both Canada and the United States of America of the conservation of the power supply in this area, the Canadian Government proposes that both Governments should agree to permit the maintenance of the level of Lake St. Francis at 152.0 during low water periods, subject to the maintenance of the normal regimen of the Lake for levels above that elevation . The proposed agreement would expire on October 1st , 1942 .
If the foregoing is acceptable to your Government, this note and your reply thereto shall be regarded as constituting a special agreement between the two Governments within the meaning of Article 4 of the Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909. []'

SIR : I have the honor to inform you that the Government of the United

The Government of the United States attaches importance to the understanding that this agreement authorizing the raising of the level of Lake St. Francis is temporary, and that this action shall not be deemed to create any vested or other right calling for or implying an extension of the authority to raise the level of Lake St. Francis beyond October 1 , 1942 .

Agreement between the United States of America , the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and Iran respecting food supply for Iran. Signed at Tehran December 4 , 1942.

December 4, 1942 [ E. A. 8. 292]

FOOD AGREEMENT BETWEEN
THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES, THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED KINGDOM
AND THE IMPERIAL IRANIAN GOVERNMENT

The Government of the United States, the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Imperial Iranian Government :
Considering that the responsibility of feeding the people of Iran rests primarily on the Imperial Iranian Government , but that it is desirable, inasmuch as war conditions may bring economic distress to the people of Iran and inasmuch as it is the general policy of the Governments of the United States and the United Kingdom to safeguard the economic existence of the peoples of the Middle East against such distress, to take all possible steps to ensure the supply of cereals (wheat together with barley, rice and other adulterants) for the bread supply of the people of Iran until the gathering of the harvest in 1943 , and
Having regard to the undertaking given by the Imperial Iranian Government to carry out :-
(a) All measures recommended by the United States Adviser to the Ministry of Food , including measures to prevent hoarding and the introduction of rationing of foodstuffs , and
(b) All recommendations of the Road Transport Committee which are certified to be essential for the regulation of the means of road transport in Iran by the majority vote of the following three members of that Committee, namely, the Chairman appointed by the Imperial Iranian Government, and the members designated by the United States and British Ministers at Tehran respectively,
Have agreed as follows :

ARTICLE I.
If the Iranian Minister of Food, with the concurrence of the United States Adviser, and the United States and British Ministers at Tehran decide, by a majority vote, that they are satisfied that all practicable

1836

steps have been taken by the Imperial Iranian Government under their undertakings referred to above, and that nevertheless the supply of cereals within Iran for the bread supply of the people of Iran is insufficient to cover the minimum needs of the population of Iran for the current year ending with the gathering of the 1943 harvest , the Governments of the United States and of the United Kingdom will take all steps within the full limit of their powers to ensure that supplies of cereals will be brought to Iran from other sources sufficient to make up the deficiency.

ARTICLE II.

Responsibility for

distribution.

The Imperial Iranian Government are responsible

(a) for the distribution of cereals within Iran, (b) for ensuring that a deficiency in one area is met by supplies from another area in Iran when the total supply of cereals within Iran is sufficient for the needs of the population of the country as a whole, and

Transport.

(c) for the distribution to necessitous areas of any supplies brought into Iran from other sources in fulfilment of the undertakings of the other two Governments in Article I above.
Recognising that the capacity of the Imperial Iranian Government to discharge its above-mentioned responsibilities is limited by the means of transport at its disposal, the Governments of the United States and of the United Kingdom will take all steps within the full limit of their powers, to ensure that the means of transport at the disposal of the Imperial Iranian Government shall be sufficient, if put to the best possible use, for the proper distribution of these cereals .

IN WITNESS WHEREOF the undersigned, being duly authorised to this effect by their respective Governments , have signed the present Agreement and have affixed their seals.

In this connection I wish on behalf of my Government to offer the assurances required by the Law that, with a view to receiving the cooperation envisaged in the Law, it has made commitments to assume at least one-third of the expenditures to be incurred henceforth by it and by the United States in the survey and construction of the Highway within the borders of Costa Rica. To this end it has already concluded arrangements with the Export-Import Bank of Washington by which it has received a credit now amounting to $2,200,000 which, under its contract with the Bank, may not be expended, without the Bank's assent, for any purpose other than the construction of the Inter-American Highway. In addition, my Government owns road building equipment valued at several hundred thousand dollars which is being made available for the construction of the Inter-American Highway and which will substantially increase the contribution of my Government to the construction of the Highway .
I trust that these facts will constitute ample assurance that my Government has made the commitments envisaged in the law to assume at least one-third of the expenditures which are proposed to be incurred henceforth by Costa Rica and by the United States in the completion of the survey and construction of the Inter American Highway in Costa Rica in accordance with present proposals.

MR . SECRETARY OF STATE :

Complying with instructions received from my Government, I have the honor to request Your Excellency's kind cooperation in the following matter:
Public Act No. 375 , [ ] approved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America, assigns a sum not greater than twenty million dollars ($20,000,000) for cooperating with the Governments of the Central American republics in the study and building of the Pan American Highway. The Government of El Salvador, after having signed the corresponding loan contract with the Export-Import Bank of Washington, is ready to continue work on the Pan American Highway, which is already quite well advanced , the National Legislative Assembly having approved for that purpose by Decree No. 109 , published in the Diario Oficial of December 24 last, an extraordinary budget amounting to the sum of one million colones ( 1,000,000) for the financing of the building of one third of what remains to be built of the section of the Pan American Highway belonging to El Salvador.
My Government takes the liberty of most courteously requesting the Government of the United States of America to authorize the Office of Public Roads Administration , Federal Works Agency, to take the steps necessary to render effective, so far as El Salvador is concerned, the cooperation contemplated in Public Act No. 375 mentioned above.

I take the liberty of enclosing with this note two certified copies of Legislative Decree No. 109 , mentioned above.

I thank you in advance for the courteous consideration which Your Excellency may be pleased to give this matter.

I take great pleasure in availing myself of this new opportunity to

repeat to Your Excellency the assurances of my highest consideration.

DEPARTMENT OF STATE WASHINGTON

SIR :

February 13, 1942

I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your Legation's kind

note of January 30, 1942 in which the cooperation of the Government

of the United States was requested in the construction of the Inter-

American Highway in El Salvador, and the assurances required by Public Law 375 of December 26, 1941 were offered in connection with

such cooperation.

I take pleasure in informing you that the assurances offered are satisfactory to this Government . It is consequently the intention of this Government to extend to the Salvadoran Government the coopera-

tion envisaged in the Law, subject to the appropriation of the necessary funds by the Congress of the United States and to the receipt of the necessary assurances from the other Republics mentioned in the Law.
You are, of course, aware that by the terms of the Law the survey and construction work which it authorizes shall be under the administration of the Public Roads Administration , Federal Works Agency. It is understood that the competent Salvadoran authorities are now making a subsidiary agreement with the Administration to carry out this provision of the Law.

I am much gratified at the prospect that through this cooperative undertaking it will be possible to complete the Inter-American Highway through El Salvador. Transportation facilities will be improved, new lands and new natural resources developed , additional markets opened, and local economic conditions benefitted through the useful expenditure of money which this project envisages . Both of our countries should happily profit therefrom. I sincerely trust that the Highway will serve not only as a link to increase material intercourse between our nations but also as another bond in the close friendship which unites us.

Accept, Sir, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration.

For the Secretary of State : SUMNER WELLES

Minister of El Salvador.

APRIL 8 , 1942 .

SIR: With reference to conversations which I have held with officials of

the Government of the United States , I have the honor to inform you that my Government is desirous of securing the cooperation of the United States in the construction of the Inter-American Highway, envisaged in Public Law 375 of the Congress of the United States of December 26 , 1941.[']
In accordance with the terms of this Law, I therefore request in the name of my Government that the Government of the United States extend cooperation in the construction of the Inter-American Highway in Nicaragua. In this connection, I herewith give formal assurances that the Government of my country will assume onethird of the expenditures to be incurred subsequent to December 26 , 1941 by the United States and Nicaragua in the survey and construction of the highway within the borders of Nicaragua.
On December 16 , 1941 my Government secured a credit of $2,000,000 from the Export-Import Bank of Washington. A sum of $ 1,250,000 from this credit has been allocated toward my Government's share of the cost of the survey and construction of the Highway as defined above. In addition my Government is making available, as a contribution towards its share in the Project, roadbuilding equipment and materials which it now owns to a value of $250,000 . In the event that these contributions should prove insufficient to pay my Government's share of the Project , it also agrees to contribute in due time an additional amount sufficient to fulfill the obligations which it has incurred under the assurances given in the preceding paragraph.
My Government is aware that the survey and construction work authorized by Public Law 375 is to be under the administration of the Public Roads Administration , Federal Works Agency . It is therefore the intention of the appropriate Nicaraguan authorities, following this exchange of notes, to reach a subsidiary agreement with that Administration to carry out this provision of the Law.
I trust that these assurances will be satisfactory to your Government for the purposes of the Law.

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [56 STAT.
During the conversations which I have had with officials of the Government of the United States, careful consideration was given to the routing of the Inter-American Highway between Sebaco in Nicaragua and the Honduran frontier. It was generally agreed that in deciding this question there should be taken into account both the international character of the proposed road and the needs of Nicaragua's economy, with neither of these two factors being given exclusive weight. On this basis, it is the proposal of my Government that the Inter-American Highway between the points mentioned be constructed so as to pass through the towns of Matagalpa , Jinotega and Condega, with the definitive routing between those points subject to final survey .
I take pleasure in availing myself of this opportunity to present to you the assurances of my highest consideration.

I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of Your Excellency's kind

note of April 8, 1942 in which you requested the cooperation of the United States Government in the construction of the Inter-American

Highway in Nicaragua. I take pleasure in informing Your Excellency that the assurances

which you offer meet the requirements of Public Law 375 of the Congress of the United States of December 26 , 1941. It is consequently the intention of this Government, as soon as the subsidiary agreement which you mention has been concluded between the United

States Public Roads Administration and the appropriate Nicaraguan officials , to extend to the Nicaraguan Government the cooperation envisaged in the above-mentioned Law, subject to the appropriation of the necessary funds by the Congress of the United States and to the

receipt ofthe necessary assurances from the other Republics mentioned in the Law.

My Government has given careful consideration to the route proposed by Your Excellency's Government for the highway between Sebaco and the Honduran frontier and is in agreement therewith.

Preliminary surveys have shown that a practicable route exists via Matagalpa, Jinotega, and Condega although in the case of Jinotega, it is indicated that the highway itself will pass somewhat to the north and east of the town, and a short approach road will be required .

I have the honour to refer to the informal and unofficial discussions

which have been conducted by the Department with Mr. Luís Ortiz

States and educational institutions and organizations in this country on the other hand , whereunder advanced students from Peru would

receive further technical training in the United States. In this connection I now have the honour to request the kind coop-
eration of the Department of State in the proposed program, and to inform Your Excellency that the Peruvian Government are prepared to invest a sum of about $ 50,000 in it, subject to the conditions envisaged in the informal discussions above-mentioned , wherein on the understanding that the sum in question would be devoted principally to maintenance grants and, where necessary, tuition costs , the Department of State is willing to award travel grants during the 1943 fiscal year to sixteen or twenty properly selected and qualified Peruvians and to use its good offices with the Institute of International Education in order to obtain as many tuition scholarships as possible for these persons . The following specific conditions would govern the establishment of the proposed program :

( 1 ) The Peruvian Government would decide on the fields of study in which technical instruction is to be given and on the number of persons to be appointed in each field . This information would be
submitted immediately to the Department of State in order that the Institute of International Education might earmark the necessary scholarships for as many fields as possible and send information to Peru regarding the general requirements for study in each field, for the guidance of the selection authorities.
(2) The Peruvian Government would announce the study opportunities and state that qualified students needing travel assistance would be recommended to the United States Government for travel grants.

1860

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [56 STAT.

(3) Candidates would be selected by a permanent committee to be set up in Lima with the cooperation of the American Embassy and would be placed in United States Universities by the Institute of International Education . It should be understood that the Institute would have a free hand in placing the students to their best advantage and that the term of study would be one year, to be extended in special cases to two years.
(4) The Peruvian Government or the candidates chosen would make travel reservations from Peru, but the United States Government would pay the travel costs by the most direct route and per diem while in travel status. Prioroties for air travel would not be requested by the Department of State and candidates would be expected to come by sea with the approval of their government in the event air transportation was not readily available.
(5) The proposed program would be coordinated as far as possible with existing opportunities for study or training in the United States, such as the Inter-American Trade Scholarships, the internships of the United States Public Health Service, fellowships under the Convention for the Promotion of Inter-American Cultural Relations, and the Department of Agriculture training programs. This would require centralization of information and publicity regarding the scholarships and of the selection of candidates, and it is suggested that these activities might be functions of the Peruvian North American Cultural Institute working in cooperation with the Peruvian authorities .

Please accept, Your Excellency, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration.

DEPARTMENT OF STATE WASHINGTON March 31 , 1942

I have the honor to inform you that the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 , as amended , ['] provides that with certain exceptions every male citizen of the United States and every other male person residing in the United States between the ages of 18 and 65

shall register. The Act further provides that , with certain exceptions , registrants within specified age limits are liable for active military service in the United States armed forces .

This Government recognizes that from the standpoint of morale of the individuals concerned and the over-all military effort of the countries at war with the Axis Powers, it would be desirable to permit certain classes of individuals who have registered or who may register

under the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 , as amended , to enlist in the armed forces of a co-belligerent country, should they desire to do so. It will be recalled that during the World War this Government signed conventions with certain associated powers on

this subject. The United States Government believes, however, that under existing circumstances the same ends may now be accom-

this country. Individuals who so elect will be physically examined by the armed forces of the United States, and if found physically qualified, the results of such examinations will be forwarded to the proper authorities of the co-belligerent nation for determination of acceptability.

Government to initiate a procedure which will permit aliens who have registered under the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, as amended, who are nationals of co-belligerent countries and who have not declared their intention of becoming American citizens, to elect to serve in the forces of their respective countries, in lieu of service in the armed forces of the United States, at any time prior to their induction into the armed forces of the United States.

I am instructed by my Government to inform you that it desires to avail itself of the procedure set out and to give you the following assurances-

(a) No threat or compulsion of any nature will be exercised by the Australian Government to induce any person in the United States to enlist in the forces of any foreign Government.
(b) Reciprocal treatment will be granted to American citizens by the Australian Government ; that is, prior to induction in the armed forces of Australia they will be granted the opportunity of electing to serve in the armed services of the United States . Furthermore, all American citizens serving in the Australian forces, or former American citizens who have lost their American citizenship by joining these forces and are still serving in them, will be informed that they may transfer to the United States forces if they so desire, and if they are acceptable to the United States forces .
(c) No enlistments will be accepted in the United States by the Australian Government of American citizens subject to registration or of aliens of any nationality who have declared their intention of becoming American citizens and are subject to registration .

My Government proposes, when the procedure comes into effect, that American citizens who are to be released from service in the

Australian forces should be handed over to the United States service

authorities there for re-enlistment.

I should be glad to learn what machinery it is proposed to set up to

give effect to the above-mentioned arrangement .

AMBASSADE DE BELGIQUE

No. 4421

WASHINGTON, July 31, 1942

SIR :

I have the honor to refer to your Excellency's note of March 31 , 1942 concerning the application of the U.S.A. Selective Training Service Act of 1940 , as amended, to Belgian Nationals residing in the U.S.A.

Your Excellency is well aware that, according to Belgian law, Belgian nationals only and no aliens are liable for military service. Consequently, no American citizen residing on Belgian territory has ever been submitted to military service in Belgian forces ; on the other hand, Belgians are liable for military service in the Belgian army wherever they reside.
The Belgian Government had, therefore, reason to expect that Belgians residing in the U.S.A. be given the same treatment regarding military service as is given to Americans living on Belgian territory. In the absence of a de facto reciprocity, the Belgian Government feels that an agreement should have been reached between the U.S.A. and

Belgium before Belgian citizens living in the U.S.A. be conscripted for military service in the U.S.A. forces . It may be pointed out in this connection that according to an opinion expressed by the Hague Peace Conference of 1907 , the conscription of aliens should be regulated by special treaties between the interested governments.
The Belgian Government regrets that the American Government has adopted , as regards military service, a policy which seriously hampers the efforts of the Belgian Government to carry on the fight against the Axis Powers.
Since Belgium is occupied by the enemy, the Belgian Government lacks man power to reinforce its small armed forces in England as well as to meet the needs of its Colony . With the exception of the few Belgians who succeed in escaping from the occupied country, Belgian nationals residing in free countries and particularly in the U.S.A. constitute the sole available supply of man power for the Belgian Government.
As has already been emphasized , it is of paramount political importance for the Belgian Government to raise and organize an armed force in the present conflict, while the presence of Belgian units fighting under the Belgian flag will be an obvious advantage to the common cause for the future liberation of Belgian territory and the reestablishment of law and order therein..

In the note of March 31st, your Excellency states that the government of the U.S.A. is prepared to initiate a procedure which will permit non-declarant Belgian nationals , who have registered under the U.S.A. Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 , as amended , to elect, at any time prior to their induction into the armed forces of the U.S.A. , to serve in the armed forces of Belgium , in lieu of service in the forces of the U.S.A.

1891

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [56 STAT.

Although the proposals of the American Government are far from meeting the wishes of the Belgian Government, such as they were set forth in previous notes of this Embassy, in view of the close cooperation between the U.S.A. and Belgium in the prosecution of the war, the Belgian Government is prepared to participate in the régime outlined in your Excellency's note of March 31st .
The Belgian Government agrees that :
A. No threat or compulsion of any nature will be exercised by the Belgian Government to induce any person in the U.S.A. to enlist in the forces of Belgium or of any other foreign government .
It should be understood that this engagement is not intended :

16 Stat. 747; 18 Stat. (pt. 2) 61.

1. to prevent the Belgian Government from informing non-declarant Belgian nationals in the U.S.A. of their military obligations according to the Belgian law, so long as nothing is said or done by the Belgian Government in the U.S.A. by way of threat or compulsion.
2. to waive the right of enforcing the provisions of the Belgian law and those of the Naturalization Convention of 1868 between the U.S.A. and Belgium, upon Belgians residing in the U.S.A. who were called to the colours by the Belgian Government and failed to answer this call before the arrangements proposed in your Excellency's note of March 31st becomes effective .

B. Reciprocal treatment will be granted to American citizens by the Belgian Government, should the conscription of American citizens residing on Belgian soil be established by the Belgian Government ; that is, prior to induction in the armed forces of Belgium, these American citizens will be granted the opportunity of electing to serve in the armed forces of the U.S.A. in substantially the same manner as set forth in your Excellency's note of March 31st .
Furthermore, the Belgian Government shall agree to inform all American citizens who may be serving in its armed forces or former American citizens who may have lost their citizenship as a result of having taken an oath of allegiance on enlistment in such armed forces and who are now serving in those forces that they may transfer to the armed forces of the United States provided they desire to do so and provided they are acceptable to the armed forces of the U.S.A.
It should be understood , however, that the U.S. Government will accord the same right of transfer to Belgian citizens now serving in the U.S.A. forces as is accorded U.S. citizens serving in Belgian forces.
The arrangements for effecting such transfers are to be worked out by the appropriate representatives of the armed forces of the respective governments.

56 STAT. ] BELGIUM-MILITARY SERVICE- Mar. 31 , July 31, 1942 Oct. 10, 16, 1942
C. No enlistments will be accepted in the U.S.A. by the Belgian Government of American citizens subject to registration or of aliens of any nationality who have declared their intention of becoming American citizens and are subject to registration.
In order to make sure that Belgian nationals in the U.S.A. be informed of the conditions of service in the armed forces of Belgium, this Embassy will give the Selective Service System of the U.S.A. pamphlets setting forth the conditions of service, on the understanding that the Selective Service System will make the pamphlets available to non-declarant Belgian nationals who are called up for induction into the armed forces of the U.S.A.
The Belgian Government would also appreciate it if the names and addresses of Belgian subjects who are free to elect to serve in the armed forces of Belgium could be made available to this Embassy.
The Belgian Government referring to this Embassy's note of April 23rd regarding the reentry permits of the Belgian nationals who are permanent residents of the U.S.A. and are serving or will elect to serve abroad in the armed forces of Belgium, assumes that these Belgians will be permitted to return to the U.S.A. at any time within six months after the termination of their service with the Belgian forces.
I avail myself, Sir , of this occasion, to renew to Your Excellency, the assurances of my highest consideration.

I have the honor to refer further to your note D.488 no . 4221 of July 31 , 1942 in the matter of the proposed arrangement concerning the services of nationals of one country in the armed forces of the other country.

The appropriate authorities of this Government have given careful consideration to your note, and consider it to contain satisfactory assurances. Accordingly, the reciprocal induction arrangement between the United States and Belgium is considered as having become effective on August 4 , 1942 , the date on which your note was received in the Department. The appropriate authorities of this Government are being informed accordingly.

Effective date.

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [56 STAT.
In regard to the third paragraph on page 4 of your note, in which you express the understanding of your Government that the Government of the United States will accord the same right of transfer to Belgian citizens now serving in the armed forces of the United States as is accorded to American citizens serving in the Belgian forces, I am pleased to inform you the necessary arrangements have been made by the War Department to release, upon application, all nondeclarant Belgian nationals in the United States forces who desire to be discharged in order that they may transfer to the Belgian forces.
However, in regard to the hope expressed in the penultimate paragraph of your note, that Belgian nationals who elect to serve in the armed forces of Belgium will be permitted to return to the United States within six months after the termination of their service with the Belgian forces , I have to inform you that this matter is still under consideration by the appropriate authorities of the Government . I shall communicate further with you as soon as definite arrangements in regard to this question have been made.
The Director of Selective Service has indicated that it will not be possible for the Selective Service System to furnish the desired names and addresses of Belgian nationals registered under Selective Service, since the compilation of such lists would place an added burden on the local boards which cannot be undertaken at this time. He also states that he assumes that, in so far as Belgium is concerned, the details of the action taken by the Selective Service System will be exactly as outlined in the enclosed local board release of May 2 , 1942. [2]
Major W. D. Partlow of the War Department, and Major Sherrow G. Parker of the Selective Service System, will be available to discuss with the appropriate Belgian officials the details relating to this arrangement.
Accept, Excellency, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration.

SIR:

DEPARTMENT OF STATE WASHINGTON March 31 , 1942

I have the honor to refer to conversations which have taken place between officers of the Netherlands Legation and of the Department

with respect to the application of the United States Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 , as amended , [' ] to Netherlands subjects residing in the United States .

As you are aware, the Act provides that with certain exceptions every male citizen of the United States and every other male person residing in the United States between the ages of eighteen and sixtyfive shall register. The Act further provides that, with certain exceptions , registrants within specified age limits are liable for active military service in the United States armed forces.
This Government recognizes that from the standpoint of morale of the individuals concerned and the over-all military effort of the countries at war with the Axis Powers, it would be desirable to permit certain classes of individuals who have registered or who may register

under the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 , as amended, to enlist in the armed forces of a cobelligerent country, should they desire to do so. It will be recalled that during the World War this Government signed conventions with certain associated powers on

this subject. The United States Government believes , however,

that under existing circumstances the same ends may now be accom-

plished through administrative action, thus obviating the delays

incident to the signing and ratification of conventions.

This Government is prepared, therefore, to initiate a procedure

countries, in lieu of service in the armed forces of the United States, at any time prior to their induction into the armed forces of this

country. Individuals who so elect will be physically examined by the

armed forces of the United States, and if found physically qualified , the results of such examinations will be forwarded to the proper

The Netherlands Ambassador to the Secretary of State

NETHERLANDS EMBASSY WASHINGTON, D.O.
No 4521

WASHINGTON, D.C. , July 2, 1942.

SIR, I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of Your Excellency's fur-
ther note of May 6 , 1942 , [ 2] No 811.2222 ( 1940/712) in the matter of the application of the United States Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 , as amended, to Netherlands subjects residing in the United States.
After giving the most careful attention to the reasons set forth in that note which have prompted the Government of the United States to reach a decision as explained therein, my Government cannot but express its great disappointment at the policy adopted by the United States Government which will prevent an important number of Netherlands subjects to fulfill their military duties in the armed forces of their own country, while it also seriously hampers the efforts of the Netherlands Government to reinforce their military effectives, a considerable part of which were lost in the fight against the common enemies of the United Nations . In previous conferences and in correspondence with the Department of State on this subject the Netherlands Embassy has already had an opportunity to stress the obvious advantage for the common war effort to use preferably men of Netherlands nationality fighting under the Netherlands flag for the future liberation of Netherlands territory and the re-establishing of law and order there. As Your Excellency is undoubtedly aware, the number of men in the Netherlands Armed forces is already extremely limited under existing conditions, whereas by the proposed arrangement the principal source of manpower for those forces , to wit from among those living in the United States would henceforth be reduced to unappreciable figures.
The Netherlands Government regrets that apparently no alternative is left but to comply with the proposals in question, although they are being felt as a considerable handicap in the Government's constant endeavor to prepare for the liberation of its country from the invader as one of its contributions to the combined war effort.
My Government has noted that the United States Government is prepared to permit Netherlands nationals who have registered under the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 as amended , and who have not declared their intention of becoming American citizens, to elect to serve in the Netherlands forces, in lieu of service in the armed forces of the United States, at any time prior to their induction into the armed forces of this country.
The Netherlands Government assumes that the names and addresses of Netherlands subjects , who are free to elect to serve in the armed forces of the Netherlands will be made available immediately to the Director of Netherlands Military Registration in the United States, 10 Rockefeller Plaza, New York. It is therefore requested that the

2 [Not printed .]

56 STAT. ] NETHERLANDS- MILITARY SERVICE- Mar. 31 , July 2, 1942 Sept. 24, 30, 1942
National Headquarters Selective Service System be instructed accordingly and that the Netherlands Military authorities will be allowed to exchange information with the local boards.
Individuals who ellect to serve in the Netherlands Armed forces need not be physically examined by the medical service of the armed forces of the United States. The appropriate Netherlands authorities will provide for the medical examination. If it is found that the individual is not acceptable for the armed forces of the Netherlands , he shall then become liable for immediate induction into the armed forces of the United States.
In connection with the foregoing the attention of the Government of the United States is invited to the fact that in case Netherlands subjects enter the American military service of their own free choice, without previously having obtained the official permission of the Netherlands Government to do so, they thereby lose the status of Netherlands subject according to article 7, paragraph 4 of the Netherlands Law on nationality and citizenship.
The Netherlands Government therefore would feel obliged if the United States authorities concerned could see their way not to accept such aliens for military service without such permission previously having been obtained , in which connection the Netherlands Government explicitly reserves full authority to grant or refuse permission, as each particular case would seem to warrant.
In view of the foregoing, the Netherlands Government on its part agrees that:
A) No threat or compulsion of any nature will be exercised by the Netherlands Government to induce any person in the United States to enlist in the forces of any foreign government.
B) Reciprocal treatment will be granted to American citizens by the Netherlands Government ; that is , prior to induction in the Armed Forces of that Government, they will be granted the opportunity of electing to serve in the Armed Forces of the United States in substantially the same manner as outlined above. Furthermore the Netherlands Government agrees to inform all American citizens serving in the Netherlands Armed Forces or former American citizens who may have lost their citizenship as a result of having taken an oath of allegiance on enlistment in such Armed Forces, and who are now serving in those Forces , that they may transfer to the Armed Forces of the United States provided that they desire to do so and provided they are acceptable to the Armed Forces of the United States. The arrangements for effecting such transfers are to be worked out by the appropriate representatives of the Armed Forces of our Governments.
C) No enlistments will be accepted in the United States by the Netherlands Government of American citizens subject to registration or of aliens of any nationality who have declared their intention of becoming American citizens and are subject to registration .

1903

1904

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [56 STAT.

It should, however, be understood that the arrangement set forth above does not intend to prevent the Netherlands Government from exercising its sovereign powers under existing treaties and international

law to protect the rights and to impose duties upon its citizens residing in the United States, and to take such measures to that effect as may appear necessary.
The Netherlands Government suggests the regime as proposed above to become effective immediately upon receipt of a note from Your Excellency stating that the Government of the United States agrees thereto, particularly with regard to the names and addresses to be supplied by the Selective Service System.
The Netherlands Government assumes that pending the negotiations concerning the above the Selective Service Headquarters will instruct the local Boards to refrain from enlisting persons into the armed forces of the United States who under the proposed agreement are free to elect to serve in the Netherlands armed forces .

The appropriate authorities of this Government have given careful consideration to the contents of your note, and consider it to contain satisfactory assurances in regard to the points raised in the Department's note of March 31 , 1942. Accordingly, the arrangement is

The Selective Service System, in connection with your request to be given the names and addresses of Netherlands subjects who are free to opt for service in the netherlands armed forces, has made the following statement :

"This Headquarters has no available list of declarant citizens of the Netherlands except the names taken from Alien's Personal History and Statement (DSS Form 304) . It is now contemplated that the use of this form will be discontinued shortly, at least as far as cobelligerent and neutral countries are concerned. If this should be the case, it will be very difficult and practically impossible to furnish the names desired , since it will be inadvisable to request local boards to undertake the added burden of compiling such lists ."

BRITISH EMBASSY, WASHINGTON, D.C. , April 29th, 1942

SIR,

I have the honour to refer to your note of March 30th in regard to the application of the Selective Training and Service Act to British subjects residing in the United States .

2. His Majesty's Government are in sympathy with the objects of the proposal contained in your note, and will be glad to see the régime made effective immediately . As regards the stipulations set forth in the fifth paragraph of that note, His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom agree to stipulations (a) and (c) without qualifications, and are glad to give the required assurances. As regards

stipulation (b) , His Majesty's Government will grant reciprocal treatment to American citizens in the United Kingdom ; further information in regard to the arrangements for American citizens of military age in the United Kingdom will be supplied shortly . American citizens now serving in the Royal Navy who wish to transfer will be released unconditionally. American citizens now serving in the British Army will be allowed to resign their Commissions or take their discharge if the United States Military authorities in the United Kingdom are prepared to accept them. On discharge they will be given into the charge of the United States Military authorities in the United Kingdom, to be enlisted into the United States forces. United States citizens serving in the Royal Air Force will be treated in accordance with arrangements which have been agreed upon by the Air Ministry, the Royal Canadian Air Force and the American Military Mission in London. The State Department is doubtless aware of these arrangements . They will be put into effect by an Air Ministry order which will shortly be issued , of which the following is a summary :-

1. The application must be made in writing within fifteen days of the publication of the order.
2. No guarantee can be given whether or when the transfer will be effected . The efficiency of the war effort of the United Nations as a whole is the first consideration .

56 STAT. ] GREAT BRITAIN- MILITARY SERVICE- Mar. 30, Apr. 29 , 1942 June 9, Sept. 30, 1942

3. Transfers will be allowed only to suitable vacancies in United States forces which may be stationed in the country in which the men are serving, since shipping difficulties preclude transfers involving sea passages .

4. The transfer will be subject to the report of a Medical Board and interview by the United States Army authorities .
5. His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom trust that the above arrangements, which apply to former American citizens who may have lost their citizenship as the result of having taken an Oath of Allegiance as well as to American citizens in the full sense of the word, will be regarded by the United States authorities as satisfying the stipulations of the fifth paragraph of your note under reply, and will thus enable the régime described in that note to be brought into effect.

The British Ambassador to the Secretary of State
No. 282
His Majesty's Ambassador presents his compliments to the Secretary of State, and with reference to his note to Mr. Hull of April 29th on the subject of the application of the Selective Training and Service Act to British subjects in the United States, has the honour to inform the Department that a bill will shortly be introduced in Parliament to enable the United Kingdom National Service Acts to be applied to Allied Nationals who do not join their National Forces within a reasonable period or hold a certificate of exemption from military service issued by their own Government.
The primary object of this bill is to deal with refractory Nationals in the United Kingdom of Allied countries whose governments are established there and who refuse to comply with calling up notices from those governments, since His Majesty's Government, like the United States Government, are unwilling to allow the enforcement in the United Kingdom of foreign conscription laws. In pursuance of the general policy towards Allied Governments this legislation will however only be applied to specific Allied nationalities with the concurrence of respective Allied government .
The numbers of United States citizens of military age in the United Kingdom available for military service must be very small, but His Majesty's Government presume that on the basis of that reciprocity which they favour in this matter United States Government will wish

1909

the proposed legislation to be applied eventually to United States citizens. If this presumption is confirmed it is suggested that the Foreign Office should show the text of the bill to the United States Embassy in London and should discuss its details with them.

I have the honor to advise you that the competent authorities of this Government consider your two notes of April 29 , 1942 , relative to the application of the United States Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, as amended , to British subjects residing in the United

States, to contain satisfactory assurances concerning the points raised in my note of March 30 , 1942. The procedure described in my note of March 30 is accordingly deemed to be in effect with respect to Great Britain and the War Department and the Selective Service System have been so advised.

The procedure contemplated to enable non-declarant British subjects and nationals residing in the United States to be enrolled in the British armed forces is identical with that now in effect for Canadian nationals, which is described in detail in the enclosed memorandum of May 2 , 1942 [2] from the National Headquarters of the Selective Service System to all state directors . It is contemplated that this same procedure will be applicable to the nationals of any country with which an agreement on this subject may be concluded .
It is understood that certain specific agreement must be reached between the armed forces of our two Governments, particularly with reference to the transfer of individuals from the armed forces of the

United Kingdom to the armed forces of the United States.

Accept, Excellency, the renewed assurances of my highest considera-

The foregoing applies also to Indian nationals.

I have the honor to refer to conversations which have taken place

As you are aware the Act provides that with certain exceptions every male citizen of the United States and every other male person residing in the United States between the ages of 18 and 65 shall register. The Act further provides that, with certain exceptions , registrants within specified age limits are liable for active military service in the United States armed forces.

This Government recognizes that from the standpoint of morale of the individuals concerned and the over-all military effort of the coun-

SIR,

I have the honour to refer to your letter dated the 30th March, 1942 to His Excellency the British Ambassador regarding the application of the United States Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 , as amended, to British subjects residing in the United States.
2. In paragraph 7 of that letter the Government of the United

States expressed its willingness to make the proposed regime effective

with respect to India upon the receipt of formal assurances similar to

those outlined earlier in the despatch. The Government of India has

authorised me to say that it accepts the procedure proposed , and gives

an assurance that no threat or compulsion of any nature will be

exercised to induce any person in the United States to enlist in the

forces of my Government. Similarly no enlistments will be accepted

in the United States of American citizens subject to registration or of

aliens of any nationality who have declared their intention of becoming

American citizens and are subject to registration .

3. With regard to the request that reciprocal treatment should be

granted to American citizens by the Government of India , I am to explain that strict reciprocity is not possible as there is no conscription law for United States citizens in India. The Government of India,

however, has no objection to the Government of the United States

calling up its citizens in India for military service. 4. I have the honour to be , Sir , with the highest consideration , your

the points raised in my note of March 30 , 1942. The procedure described in my note of March 30 is accordingly deemed to be in effect with respect to India and the War Department and the Selective Service System have been so advised.

The procedure contemplated to enable Indian nationals residing in the United States to be enrolled in the British Indian armed forces is

identical with that now in effect for Canadian nationals, which is described in detail in the enclosed memorandum of May 2 , 1942[2]

It is noted that Sir Girja's note contains no indication that American citizens now serving in the armed forces of India or persons in those forces who have lost American citizenship as a result of having taken the oath of allegiance in connection with their entry into those forces have been informed that they may transfer to United States forces if they so desire and if they are acceptable to the United States . It is assumed that appropriate steps will be taken, if they have not already been taken, to have such information conveyed to any such persons who may be serving in the armed forces of India.

respect to a co-belligerent country, this Department wishes to receive

(a) No threat or compulsion of any nature will be exercised by his government to induce any person in the United States to enlist in the forces of any foreign government ;

(b) Reciprocal treatment will be granted to American citizens by his government ; that is, prior to induction in the armed forces

of his government they will be granted the opportunity of electing to serve in the armed forces of the United States in substantially

the same manner as outlined above. Furthermore, his government shall agree to inform all American citizens serving in its armed forces or former American citizens who may have lost their citizenship as a result of having taken an oath of allegiance on enlistment in such armed forces and who are now serving in

those forces that they may transfer to the armed forces of the United States provided they desire to do so and provided they are acceptable to the armed forces of the United States. The arrangements for effecting such transfers are to be worked out by

the appropriate representatives of the armed forces of the respective governments .

32/4. LEGATION OF THE UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA WASHINGTON, D.C.

SIR,

9th JUNE, 1942.

I have the honour to refer to your Note of 31st March, 1942 , and to inform you on instructions of my Government that the Government of the Union of South Africa are desirous of participating in the

procedure under which certain classes of aliens are permitted on

conditions outlined in your note, to elect for service in their own national armed forces in lieu of service in the United States armed

forces as provided by the Selective Service Act of 1940 . I am also directed to say that the Government of the Union of
South Africa agrees to the stipulations set forth in the lettered paragraphs A, B and C of your note.

In accepting the procedure and the conditions which govern it the Union Government proposes as a further proviso that all Union Nationals who may be affected by the arrangement should be attested as volunteers by this Legation before they leave the U.S.A.

Although the Union Government do not specifically indicate the reason for this proviso it is clear that such attestation is necessary in order that nullification of the procedure on the part of the Union Nationals concerned may be obviated , inasmuch as compulsory military service is not applicable in the Union of South Africa. As you may be aware the Union's armed forces are composed of volunteers only.

I shall be glad to learn as soon as possible whether the proviso indicated above is acceptable to the United States Government, and if that is the case, on what date the procedure can be regarded as taking effect.

I shall also be glad to receive in due course such practical details for carrying out of the procedure, as may be available.
Accept, Sir, the renewed assurance of my highest consideration . RALPH W. CLOSE MINISTER.

which you refer to the Department's note of March 31 , 1942 on the subject of arrangements between the Union of South Africa and this

Government concerning the services of the nationals of one country in the armed forces of the other. You state that the Government of

the Union of South Africa agrees to the stipulations set forth in para-

graphs (a) , (b) and (c) of the Department's note, and proposes as a further proviso that all Union Nationals who may be affected by the arrangement should be attested as volunteers by the Legation of the Union of South Africa before they leave the United States.

I have the honor to inform you that the appropriate authorities of this Government consider your note to contain satisfactory assurances ,

and that, accordingly, the arrangement may become effective at any time .

The Selective Service System has indicated that it assumes that all arrangements relating to this matter will be identical with those now

in effect in the case of Canada, which are outlined in the Memorandum

to All State Directors, a copy of which is attached for your information . [2] The Director of Selective Service also desires to stress that

it is important that the persons to be taken into the armed forces of South Africa under the arrangement should actually be accepted as such by the Government of the Union of South Africa before the time of their departure.

I shall be pleased to receive from you an indication as to whether your Government agrees to the proviso made by the Selective Service System. If so , it is suggested that your Government indicate the date on which it is desired that the arrangement become effective.

Accept, Sir, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration.

You state that the Director of Selective Service desires to stress that it is important that the persons to be taken into the armed forces of the Union of South Africa should actually be accepted as such by the Government of the Union of South Africa, before the time of their departure . I am directed by my Government to give the assurance that volunteers attested by the Legation will be so accepted by the Government of the Union of South Africa.
You state also that the Selective Service System assumes that the procedure relating to the transfer of registrants to the armed forces of the Union of South Africa will be identical with that now in effect in the case of Canada, which is outlined in Selective Service System Memorandum No. 1-422 dated May 2nd, 1942 .
With the exception of paragraphs 6 (a) and 7, it is agreed that the procedure outlined in the Memorandum may be conveniently applied to the Union of South Africa . In view of the fact that there may be delays in obtaining transportation for persons accepted by the Government of the Union of South Africa , it would be appreciated if modifications in procedure, on lines similar to those applied for the United Kingdom, could be accepted . The modifications contemplated for the Union of South Africa are to the following effect :
(a) that instead of endorsing the time and place of reporting and instead of enclosing meal and transportation vouchers in returning the forms, as required by paragraph 6 (a) , the Legation endorse Form 503 to the effect that the registrant will be directly notified as to time and place for reporting for induction and will then be provided with transportation and subsistence vouchers by the Legation.
(b) that the procedure outlined in paragraph 7 be so modified that if the registrant does report, the Legation will complete Form 503 "Report of Induction " , by entering as the place of induction the "Port of Embarkation".
I shall be glad to learn whether these modifications in procedure are acceptable to the United States Government. If so, the Government of the Union of South Africa would be prepared to make the proposed arrangements effective immediately upon receipt of your note in reply.

I am pleased to state that this Government considers that your Government has given all the necessary assurances . Accordingly, the arrangement with the Union of South Africa is now regarded as being in effect, and the appropriate authorities of this Government are being informed accordingly.
In this connection, I also take pleasure in informing you that the War Department is prepared to discharge, for the purpose of transferring to the armed forces of their own country, nondeclarant South African nationals now serving in the United States forces who have not heretofore had an opportunity of electing to serve in the forces of their own country, under the same conditions existing for the transfer of American citizens from the South African forces .
In regard to the various questions of procedure contained in your note under acknowledgment, I may state that these matters may be discussed directly between officials of the Legation and officers of the Selective Service System and of the War Department . Major Sherrow G. Parker of the Selective Service System, and Major V. L. Sailor of the Recruiting and Induction Section of the War Department, will be available to discuss with representatives of the South African Legation all matters relating to the practical details of the arrangement.

NATIONAL EMPLOYMENT WEEK

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA A PROCLAMATION

April 13, 1942 [No. 2552]

Annually for the past three years I have designated a National Employment Week, urging all people of the Nation to give particular attention to the employment problem of older workers , and especially of veterans of the last World War. It is fitting to remember, with respect to the latter, that these men who were in the ranks of America's military forces in 1917 and 1918 not only can serve, but are vitally needed in the ranks of industry and agriculture today . They had something to give in youth and valor then ; they have something to give in experience and skill today.
There is a place for these men and other workers past forty in the
gigantic war production program in which we are engaged . There is a place for them in jobs for which they are already fitted , and there is

Place in war production program, etc.

a place for them in job-training courses designed to build up the skills of the Nation's manpower. While employment in many industries not essential to the prosecution of the war will be diminished , it is also

true that as the war program accelerates, many Americans not now

regularly employed will be called upon to take an active part in production vital to the war effort . Yet it is not on a basis of patriotism

alone that employers are urged to open their doors to older workers , but on the basis of sound business sense as well , for it should not be

forgotten that these older workers have qualifications that younger

persons lack. Work experience, stability, and responsibility are assets we cannot afford to waste in this crisis .
The United States Employment Service with its far-flung network of full-time and part-time public employment offices has always made

FLAG DAY, 1942

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA A PROCLAMATION

May 9, 1942 [No. 2556]

For many years it has been our American custom to set aside June 14 in honor of the flag, the emblem of our freedom, our strength, and
our unity as an independent nation under God. Now we are fighting in the greatest cause the world has known. We are fighting to free the people of this earth from the most powerful, the most ruthless, the most savage enemy the world has ever seen. We are dedicating
all that we have and all that we are to the combat. We will not stop this side of victory.

We as a nation are not fighting alone. In this planetary war we are a part of a great whole: we are fighting shoulder to shoulder with

the valiant peoples of the United Nations, the massed , angered forces of common humanity. Unless all triumph, all will fail .
For these reasons it is fitting that on our traditional Flag Day we honor not only our own colors but also the flags of those who have, with us, signed the Declaration by United Nations, paying homage to those nations awaiting liberation from the tyranny we all oppose, to those whose lands have escaped the scars of battle, to those who have long been heroically fighting in the blaze and havoc of war.
It is also fitting in this time of stress that we express our devotion to our courageous mothers, many of whom are sending out their sons to

55 Stat. 1600.

do battle with the enemy and all of whom are so loyally contributing to the waging of the war on the home front.
NOW , THEREFORE, I , FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT, President of the United States of America , do hereby ask that on Flag Day, June 14, 1942 , the people of our Nation honor the peoples of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, China, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Costa Rica, Cuba , Czechoslovakia, the Dominican Republic , El Salvador, Greece , Guatemala , Haiti, Honduras, India, Luxembourg, the Netherlands , New Zealand, Nicaragua, Norway, Panama, Poland, the Union of

and to arrange, where feasible , for joint displays of the emblems of the freedom-loving nations on that day.

FIRE PREVENTION WEEK- 1942

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA A PROCLAMATION

August 5, 1942 [No. 2565]

Any loss of human life , any interference with production, any loss of critical materials hinders and impedes our war effort.
Uncontrolled fire, even in normal times, is a national menace. It kills or disables thousands of our people and destroys a significant
portion of our national wealth each year. Today, when every machine is being taxed to its fullest productive capacity, when new hands are working with unfamiliar tools, and when agents of our enemies are seeking to hinder us by every possible means, it is essential that destructive fire be brought under stricter control in order that victory may be achieved at the earliest date.
Nothing less than the united vigilance and effort of all the people will suffice to break the grip of this menace . Fire hazards everywhere must be detected at once and eliminated . Loss of life and property from blaze and smoke must be reduced in every State of the Union. Prevention of all uncontrolled fires must be our goal.
NOW, THEREFORE , I , FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT , President Designation ofweek of the United States of America , do hereby designate the week begin- as Fire Prevention
ning October 4 , 1942 , as Fire Prevention Week; and I earnestly request Week. the people of the country to give special heed to the importance of taking active measures during that week, and throughout the year, to conserve our human and material resources from the destructive toll of fire ; and I direct the Office of Civilian Defense and other appropriate Federal agencies to initiate programs for emphasizing the importance of attaining these objectives . I also desire to enlist. the cooperation of State and local governments, of educators and civic groups, and of the press , the radio, and the motion-picture industry, with a view to promoting widespread realization of the dangers of fire and knowledge of the methods of controlling it.

GENERAL PULASKI'S MEMORIAL DAY BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
A PROCLAMATION

One of the bravest of the foreign volunteers in our first struggle for existence as a free people was Count Casimir Pulaski, who was

grievously wounded on October 9, 1779, while engaged in a gallant action at the siege of Savannah, and died two days later.

The aid rendered by General Pulaski and other foreigners in the winning of our independence is vividly recalled to our minds this

year by the association of other governments and peoples with us in our present struggle. The countrymen of General Pulaski are today among our allies in a global conflict the outcome of which will

mean freedom or slavery for millions of human beings on all the continents.

Ante, p. 760.

By a joint resolution approved September 26 , 1942 (Public Law 717, 77th Congress) , the Congress has authorized me "to issue a proclamation calling upon officials of the Government to display the flag of the United States on all governmental buildings on October 11 , 1942, and inviting the people of the United States to observe the

day in schools and churches, or other suitable places, with appropriate ceremonies in commemoration of the death of General Casimir

Pulaski. "

DAYS OF PRAYER: THANKSGIVING DAY AND NEW YEAR'S DAY BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA A PROCLAMATION

November 11, 1942 [No. 2571]

"It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord." Across the uncertain ways of space and time our hearts echo those words, for the days are with us again when, at the gathering of the harvest, we solemnly express our dependence upon Almighty God.
The final months of this year, now almost spent, find our Republic and the nations joined with it waging a battle on many fronts for the preservation of liberty.
In giving thanks for the greatest harvest in the history of our nation, we who plant and reap can well resolve that in the year to come we will do all in our power to pass that milestone ; for by our labors in the fields we can share some part of the sacrifice with our brothers and sons who wear the uniform of the United States.

It is fitting that we recall now the reverent words of George Washington ,
"Almighty God, we make our earnest prayer that Thou wilt keep the United States in Thy holy protection",

and that every American in his own way lift his voice to Heaven. I recommend that all of us bear in mind this great Psalm :
"The Lord is my shepherd ; I shall not want. "He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters .
"He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake .
"Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me ; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.
"Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil ; my cup runneth over.
"Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever."

Inspired with faith and courage by these words, let us turn again to the work that confronts us in this time of national emergency:

in the armed services and the merchant marine ; in factories and offices ;

on farms and in the mines ; on highways, railways and airways ; in

FARM MOBILIZATION DAY

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA A PROCLAMATION

December 16, 1942 [No. 2574]

The people of this country may well be grateful that for three successive years the farmers of the United States have given us record harvests. Every pound of food finds use in wartime . Our soldiers , sailors, and marines require large supplies of food both in this country and abroad, and these three record-smashing years of farm production will mean much for victory .
Farmers may justly be proud of the production record of agriculture. They have achieved this record in spite of many handicaps, and the country owes them a debt of gratitude. Although they have produced much this year, the nation will require even more of them during the year that is now before us . ÎIn full realization of the

many difficulties affecting farm production during wartime , the people of this nation place reliance on the zeal, devotion, and un-

stinting efforts of farmers to do their part toward ultimate victory .

Food is no less a weapon than tanks, guns, and planes. As the

power of our enemies decreases, the importance of the food resources of the United Nations increases. With this thought in mind, we

must further mobilize our resources for the production of food:

NOW,

THEREFORE ,

I,

FRANKLIN

D.

ROOSEVELT,

Presi-

Proclamation of JJanP. 112,119343 as Farm

dent of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Tuesday, Mobilization Day.

January 12 , 1943 , as Farm Mobilization Day ; and ask that on that

day the farmers of this country gather, wherever possible, with

Department of Agriculture representatives, Extension Service agents, vocational teachers, State officials, farm organizations, and others

concerned, in order to discuss ways and means of insuring for the

year 1943 the maximum production of vital foods upon every farm in this country.
I should like Farm Mobilization Day to be a symbol of a free

America ; a symbol of the might and productivity of our nation ; and a symbol of our unalterable determination to put to full use our agricultural resources, as well as our other resources, in the achievement of complete victory .

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed .

DONE at the City of Washington this 16th day of December in

the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-two ,
