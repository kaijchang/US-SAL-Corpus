Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That it shall be lawful for the

Feb. 20, 1812. Act of March
1, 1817, ch. 30.

(a) The decisions of the Courts of the United States upon the law of Bail have been: Bail in Criminal Cases.--The circuit court has no authority to issue a habeas corpus for the purpose of surrendering a principal in discharge of his bail, when the principal is confined in jail merely under the process of a state court; nor will the court discharge the bail of such party, who has become bound by recognizance in the circuit court to answer, &c., merely on account of such impediment; but, in their discretion, the court will respite the recognizance. U. S. v. Jonathan French, 1 Gallis. C. C. R. 1. The mere continuance of a cause, on sufficient grounds exhibited by the district attorney, constitutes no reason why the court should admit a defendant who is in confinement, to bail. But if the court is satisfied that the health of the accused is such as that his life will be endangered by his being kept in confinement until next term, it furnishes a strong ground for bail. The U. S. v. Jones, 3 Wash. C. C. R. 209. Probable cause, on oath, must be stated, to justify the holding a defendant to bail under the 3d sec. of the act of Congress of 26th Feb. 1795, ch. 31. Leonard v. Caskin, Bee's Adm. Decis. 146. Aaron Burr, charged with carrying on a military expedition against a nation with whom the United States were at peace, was admitted to bail. 1 Burr's Trial, 18. The postponement of a criminal case, on the application of the defendant, to allow him an opportunity to obtain testimony, is not a cause of bail. The U. S. v. Stewart. C. C. U. S. of Pennsylvania, 2 Dall. 345. The circumstances must be very strong, which will, at any time, induce the court to admit a person to bail who stands charged with high treason. Ibid. The supreme court of the United States has jurisdiction, under the constitution and laws of the United States, to bail a person committed for trial on a criminal charge, by a district judge of the United States.
U. S. v. Hamilton, 3 Dall. 13. The marshal of the United States of the Connecticut district, upon a writ of attachment sued out by the
United States, to recover a penalty, may commit a defendant to prison for want of bail, without a mittimus from a state magistrate, as is required by the local laws of the state; for such municipal regulation does not bind the officers of the United States. Palmer v. Allen, 7 Cranch, 560; 2 Cond. Rep. 607.
Bail in Civil Cases.--The bail is fixed by the death of the principal, after the return of a capias ad satisfaciendum, and before the return of the scire facias; and the bail is not entitled to an exoneretur in such a case. Davidson v. Taylor, 12 Wheat. 604; 6 Cond. Rep. 660.
Demanding excessive bail, where the plaintiff has a good cause of action, or holding to bail where there is no cause of action, if done vexatiously, entitles the party injured to an action for a malicious prosecution. If bail be not demanded, no such action will lie. Ray v. Law, Peters' C. C. R. 207.
Pennsylvania. The circuit court will discharge, on common bail, a defendant who has been arrested for a debt contracted in the state in which he has, subsequent to the commencement of the suit, been discharged by the insolvent laws of the state. Read v. Chapman, Peters' C. C. R. 404.
Pennsylvania. Where a capias has been issued against a person who has been discharged from the debt for which it was issued, by the insolvent laws of the state in which it was contracted, the court will not quash the writ, but will discharge the defendant on common bail. Ibid.
On a rule to show cause why the defendant should not be discharged on common bail, he having been discharged under the insolvent laws of Pennsylvania; evidence to show that the discharge had been fraudulently obtained, cannot be given. Campbell et al. v. Claudius, Peters' C. C. R. 484.
Pennsylvania. Where the debt has been contracted and made payable out of the state, the circuit court will not discharge, on common bail, a defendant arrested for such debt, notwithstanding his discharge by the insolvent laws of the state in which the action was brought. Ibid.
After bail given, and plea pleaded, the defendant cannot arrest the judgment on the ground of a misnomer. Scull v. Briddle, 2 Wash. C. C. R. 200.
The proceedings were amended by the recognizance of bail, and the name of the defendant in the recognizance was inserted in the declaration. Ibid.
The court are not precluded from obtaining further satisfaction as to the debt sworn to in an. affidavit to

For the pay of the army of the United States, eight hundred and sixty-nine thousand nine hundred and sixty-eight dollars.
For forage, one hundred and four thousand six hundred and twenty four dollars.
For subsistence, six hundred and eighty-five thousand five hundred and thirty-two dollars and five cents.

if there be danger of injustice, the court will withhold it from either party, and content itself with retaining the property, or with ordering a sale thereof, and a deposit of the proceeds in the registry. Ibid. 452.
If a bond, taken on the delivery of property on bail, be void, as not conforming to law, the court will enforce a re-delivery of the property by attachment. The Struggle, 1 Gallis. C. C. R. 476.
A bond voluntarily given upon the delivery of property on bail, on application of the claimant, is good; although the condition does not exactly conform to the act of Congress, under which it may have been intended to take it. Ibid.

The act of Congress of 2d March, 1799, chap. 22, is not understood as compulsory on the court as to the delivery on bail. It still rests in the discretion of the court. Ibid. 477.

Whether the security for property, delivered on bail, be by bond or stipulation, is immaterial. On such security, a summary judgment may be entered for the appraised value, and for the costs. The Alligator. 1 Gallis. C. C. R. 145.

The district court, by virtue of its general admiralty jurisdiction, may deliver property on bail; and the form in which the security is taken is immaterial: on such security a summary judgment may be rendered to the appraised value. The Lively, 1 Gallis. C. C. R. 315.

It is the duty of commissioners to whom it is referred to estimate damages, to make their report as specific as the nature of the thing will admit; so that not only the result, but the detail of their judgment should appear. Ibid.

In cases of restitution with damages, in prize proceedings, if in order to ascertain the damages, an inspection or a sale of the cargo be, in the judgment of the commissioner or the parties, necessary ; application should be made to the court for an order of unlivery and appraisement, or for a sale, as the case may require. Ibid.

No delivery of property on bail, in a prize cause, can be made legally, where the United States are parties, without due notice to the district attorney. Ex parte Robbins, 2 Gallis. C. C. R. 320.
If the cargo is liable to deteriorate or perish, or the ship to be injured by the delay incident to the sal. vage proceedings, the proper course is to apply to the court for a sale thereof. It is not a matter of right of either party to have a delivery on bail in such cases. The Ship Nathaniel Hooper, 3 Sumner's C. C. R. 542.

Feb. 20, 1812. Act of March
1, 1817, ch. 30.

(a) The decisions of the Courts of the United States upon the law of Bail have been: Bail in Criminal Cases.--The circuit court has no authority to issue a habeas corpus for the purpose of surrendering a principal in discharge of his bail, when the principal is confined in jail merely under the process of a state court; nor will the court discharge the bail of such party, who has become bound by recognizance in the circuit court to answer, &c., merely on account of such impediment; but, in their discretion, the court will respite the recognizance. U. S. v. Jonathan French, 1 Gallis. C. C. R. 1. The mere continuance of a cause, on sufficient grounds exhibited by the district attorney, constitutes no reason why the court should admit a defendant who is in confinement, to bail. But if the court is satisfied that the health of the accused is such as that his life will be endangered by his being kept in confinement until next term, it furnishes a strong ground for bail. The U. S. v. Jones, 3 Wash. C. C. R. 209. Probable cause, on oath, must be stated, to justify the holding a defendant to bail under the 3d sec. of the act of Congress of 26th Feb. 1795, ch. 31. Leonard v. Caskin, Bee's Adm. Decis. 146. Aaron Burr, charged with carrying on a military expedition against a nation with whom the United States were at peace, was admitted to bail. 1 Burr's Trial, 18. The postponement of a criminal case, on the application of the defendant, to allow him an opportunity to obtain testimony, is not a cause of bail. The U. S. v. Stewart. C. C. U. S. of Pennsylvania, 2 Dall. 345. The circumstances must be very strong, which will, at any time, induce the court to admit a person to bail who stands charged with high treason. Ibid. The supreme court of the United States has jurisdiction, under the constitution and laws of the United States, to bail a person committed for trial on a criminal charge, by a district judge of the United States.
U. S. v. Hamilton, 3 Dall. 13. The marshal of the United States of the Connecticut district, upon a writ of attachment sued out by the
United States, to recover a penalty, may commit a defendant to prison for want of bail, without a mittimus from a state magistrate, as is required by the local laws of the state; for such municipal regulation does not bind the officers of the United States. Palmer v. Allen, 7 Cranch, 560; 2 Cond. Rep. 607.
Bail in Civil Cases.--The bail is fixed by the death of the principal, after the return of a capias ad satisfaciendum, and before the return of the scire facias; and the bail is not entitled to an exoneretur in such a case. Davidson v. Taylor, 12 Wheat. 604; 6 Cond. Rep. 660.
Demanding excessive bail, where the plaintiff has a good cause of action, or holding to bail where there is no cause of action, if done vexatiously, entitles the party injured to an action for a malicious prosecution. If bail be not demanded, no such action will lie. Ray v. Law, Peters' C. C. R. 207.
Pennsylvania. The circuit court will discharge, on common bail, a defendant who has been arrested for a debt contracted in the state in which he has, subsequent to the commencement of the suit, been discharged by the insolvent laws of the state. Read v. Chapman, Peters' C. C. R. 404.
Pennsylvania. Where a capias has been issued against a person who has been discharged from the debt for which it was issued, by the insolvent laws of the state in which it was contracted, the court will not quash the writ, but will discharge the defendant on common bail. Ibid.
On a rule to show cause why the defendant should not be discharged on common bail, he having been discharged under the insolvent laws of Pennsylvania; evidence to show that the discharge had been fraudulently obtained, cannot be given. Campbell et al. v. Claudius, Peters' C. C. R. 484.
Pennsylvania. Where the debt has been contracted and made payable out of the state, the circuit court will not discharge, on common bail, a defendant arrested for such debt, notwithstanding his discharge by the insolvent laws of the state in which the action was brought. Ibid.
After bail given, and plea pleaded, the defendant cannot arrest the judgment on the ground of a misnomer. Scull v. Briddle, 2 Wash. C. C. R. 200.
The proceedings were amended by the recognizance of bail, and the name of the defendant in the recognizance was inserted in the declaration. Ibid.
The court are not precluded from obtaining further satisfaction as to the debt sworn to in an. affidavit to

Commissioners to be appointed by the circuit courts of the U. States,

circuit court of the United States, to be holden in any district in which the present provision, by law, for taking bail and affidavits in civil causes, (in cases where such affidavits are, by law, admissible) is inadequate, or on account of the extent of such district, inconvenient, to appoint such

hold to bail, because the affidavit is positive; but the necessity to examine the party who makes the affidavit, must be presented on the face of the same. Oliver v. Parish, 2 Wash. C. C. R. 462.
New York. Under the act of Congress of 6th January, 1800, the sheriff of a county is bound to take a bond for the limits, as provided by the state laws, from a prisoner confined on process from the courts of the United States; and false imprisonment would lie on his refusal. United States v. Noah, Paine's C. C. R. 368.
New York. Such a bond has, in all respects, the same incidents, and the like legal effects with a bond taken under the state laws. Ibid.
New York. It is assignable : and an assignment discharges the sheriff from a liability for a subsequent escape. Ibid.
New York. The United States are expressly named in the act, and bound by it; and an assignment of a bond to them when they are plaintiffs, is valid. Ibid.
New York. The Secretary of the Treasury having accepted such an assignment, the court presumed that he was authorized, and held the plaintiffs bound by his acceptance. Ibid.
New York. The term " process," in the act, includes executions, as well as mesne process. Ibid. New York. After a prisoner has been enlarged upon a limit bond, the sheriff can confine him again only on the bail's becoming insufficient. He cannot accept a surrender of him ; certainly not after an assignment of the bond. Ibid. Pennsylvania. The bail to the sheriff entered special bail; on being excepted to, he refused to justify, whereupon he was sued on the bail bond, and he surrendered the principal before the return of the writ. Held, that the surrender was good, and the bail was entitled to relief on the usual terms. Stockton v. Throgmorton, 1 Baldwin's C. C. R. 148. No justification of bail is necessary, when special bail is entered for the purpose of a surrender. Ibid. Bail may take the principal on a Sunday, or in another state. Johnson v. Tomkins, 1 Baldwin's C. C. R. 577. If the defendant be discharged under an insolvent law of the state where the contract is made, after the bail bond has been assigned to the plaintiff, the court will not order an exoneretur to be entered on the bail piece. Bosbyshell v. Oppenheimer, 4 Wash. C. C. R. 317. By the Pennsylvania practice, filing the declaration before the return of the writ, is not a waiver of the bail. The English rule is otherwise, unless the declaration be filed de bene esse. Ibid. The undertaking of the appearance bail can be no otherwise fulfilled, than by the defendant giving special bail, if so ruled ; and that bail justifying, if excepted to. Ibid. If, instead of ruling the marshal to bring in the body of the defendant, the plaintiff accept an assignment of the bail bond, and bring a suit thereon, still the court will not fix the appearance bail, if certain terms are complied with ; one of which is the defendant's entering special bail. Ibid. On a rule on the plaintiff to show his cause of action, who thereupon filed a positive affidavit of the debt, the court will not order the party making the affidavit, to be examined on oath in court; no ground appearing to the court to justify a suspicion that the debt was not due. Champion v. Ross, 4 Wash. C. C. R. 325. The court will not relieve the appearance bail, upon his delivering the principal in court, unless he put in and perfect special bail. Bosbyshell v. Oppenheimer, 4 Wash. C. C. R. 317. Although the special bail may deliver up the principal at any time before the second scire facias, it does not follow that the appearance bail may do it. Their engagements are of a different nature. Ibid. Where the defendant is discharged under the insolvent law of the state where the debt was contracted, and has given special bail, the court will order an exoneretur to be entered on the bail piece. Richardson v. M`Intyre, 4 Wash. C. C. R. 412. If the special bail surrender the principal, who has been discharged under an insolvent law, the court will discharge the principal from custody. Ibid. Under the act of assembly of Virginia, the defendant may enter special bail, and defend the suit at any time before the entering up of judgment, upon a writ of inquiry executed; and the appearance of the defendant, or the entry of special bail, before such judgment, discharges the appearance bail. Bartle v. Coleman, 6 Wheat. 475 ; 5 Cond. Rep. 142. If the defendant does not appear, or give special bail, the appearance bail may defend the suit, and is liable to the same judgment as the defendant would have been liable to ; but the defendant cannot appear and consent to a reference, the report and judgment on which is to bind the appearance bail as well as himself. Such a joint judgment is erroneous, and will be reversed as to both. Ibid. District of Columbia. The bail is fixed by the death of the principal after the return of the ca. sa. and before the return of the scire facias ; and the bail is not entitled to an exoneretur in such a case. Davidson v. Taylor, 12 Wheat. 604; 6 Cond. Rep. 660. Ohio. The recognizance of special bail being a part of the proceedings in a suit, and subject to the regulation of the court, the nature, extent, and limitations of the responsibility created thereby, are to be decided, not by a mere examination of the terms of the instrument, but by a reference to the known rules of the court, and the principles of law applicable thereto. Whatever, in the sense of these rules and principles, will constitute a discharge of the liability of the special bail, must be deemed included within the purview of the instrument, as much as if it were expressly stated. Beers et al. v. Haughton, 9 Peters, 329. By the rules of the circuit court of Ohio, adopted as early as January, 1808, the liability of special bail was provided for and limited; and it was declared, that special bail may surrender their principal at any time before or after judgment against the principal, provided such surrender shall be before a return of a scire facias executed, or a second scire facias returned " nihil" against the bail. And this, in fact, constituted a part of the law of Ohio, at the time the present recognizance was given ; the same having been so enacted by the legislature. This act of the legislature of Ohio, was in force at the time of the passage of the act of Congress of the 19th of May, 1828, regulating the process of the courts of the

and so many discreet persons, in different parts of the district, as such court shall deem necessary, to take acknowledgments of bail and affidavits: which acknowledgments of bail and affidavits shall have the like force and effect as if taken before any judge of said court; and any per-

for taking bail and affidavits, and the acknowledgments so taken to have

United States, in the new states; and must therefore be deemed as a part of the "modes of proceeding in suits," and to have been adopted by it: so that the surrender of the principal within the time thus prescribed, is not a mere matter of favour of the court, but is strictly a matter of legal right. Ibid.
It is not strictly true, that on the return of "non est inventus" to a capias ad satisfaciendum against the principal, the bail is "fixed," in courts acting professedly under the common law, and independently of statute. So much are the proceedings against bail deemed a matter subject to the regulation and practice of the court, that the court will not hesitate to relieve them in a summary manner, and direct an exoneretur to be entered in cases by the indulgence of the court, by giving them time to render the principal until the appearance day of the last scire, facias against them, as in cases of strict right. Ibid.
When bail is entitled to be discharged, ex debito justitise, they may not only apply for an exoneretur by way of summary proceeding, but they may plead the matter as a bar to the suit, in their defence. But when the discharge is matter of indulgence only, the application is to the discretion of the court; and an exoneretur cannot be insisted on, except by way of motion. Ibid. *
When the party is, by the practice of the court, entitled to an exoneretur without a positive surrender of the principal, according to the terms of the recognizance ; he is, a fortiori, entitled to insist on it by way of defence, when he is entitled, ex debito justitise, to surrender the principal. Ibid.
The doctrine is fully established, that where the principal would be clearly entitled to an immediate and unconditional discharge, if he had been surrendered, there the bail are entitled to relief by entering an exoneretur without any surrender. And, a fortiori, this doctrine will apply, when the law prohibits the party from being imprisoned at all, and where by the positive operation of law the surrender is prevented. Ibid.
Where the defendants in a judgment are not liable to be imprisoned, having been released under the insolvent laws of a state, the special bail is not bound to surrender them in his discharge. Beers et al. v. Haughton, 1 M`Lean's C. C. R. 231.
To an action on the recognizance of bail, he may plead the discharge of his principal. Ibid. To hold to bail under the statute of Illinois, the affidavit must state more than the belief of the assent, or the legal import of the action on which it is founded. Wright et al. v. Cayswell, 1 M`Lean's C. C. R.

The act of 20th February, 1839, which adopted the state laws, in regard to imprisonment of debtors, took immediate effect, as well in suits pending, as in other cases. Gray, Sherwood & Co. v. Monroe et al., 1 M`Lean's C. C. R. 528.
The law relates to the remedy, and under it, when appearance bail has been given, the defendantmay, on motion, be discharged on common bail. Ibid.
Bail in Admiralty, and in Prize Causes.-Where the court of admiralty has parted with the possession of the property upon bail er stipulation, and it is necessary for the purposes of justice to retake the property into the custody of the court, the proper process against any person not a party to the stipulation, but who is alleged to have the actual or constructive possession, is a monition, and not an execution in the first instance. The Gran Para, 10 Wheat. 497; 6 Cond. Rep. 199.
Wherever a stipulation is taken in an admiralty suit for property subjected to legal process and condemnation, the stipulation is deemed a mere substitute for the thing itself; and the stipulators are liable to the exercise of all those authorities on the part of the court, which it could properly exercise if the thing was in custody. The Palmyra, 12 Wheat. 1; 6 Cond. Rep. 397.
Regularly there should be no delivery of prize property on bail, until after a hearing of the cause, and in most cases a sale is preferable to an appraisement. The George, 2 Gallis. C. C. R. 249.
Proceedings by libel were instituted upon a seizure of goods, and a bond given for their appraised value on the delivery of the goods to the claimant. Afterwards the libel was by amendment changed to an information, and the goods were condemned. On an application for an attachment against the obligors in the bond, it was held that although the case was not regularly within the 89th section of the collection law, yet a compliance with the stipulations in the bond might be enforced by attachment against the obligors. United States v. Four Part Pieces of Woollen Cloth, 1 Paine, 435.
And the court held that it made no difference that the obligors were only sureties, and had not themselves received the goods. Ibid.
If the claimant is not a party on the bond, all the obligors are to be deemed principals. Ibid. The bond was taken in the district court of New York, and under the statute dividing the district, the proceedings were transferred to the district court of the northern district, and by a subsequent statute to this court, where the condemnation took place. The condition of the bond was to pay the appraised value of the goods into the district court, if they should be condemned in that court. Held, that a condemnation in this court had the same effect to forfeit the bond. Ibid. In prize causes, before a hearing, the property is never delivered on bail, unless by consent. If it is perishable, the proper remedy is by an appraisement and sale ; and in like manner the court will decree a sale, pending the proceedings, for any other justifiable cause. After a hearing, the property may, in the discretion of the court, be delivered on bail. In cases ordered for further proof, a delivery on bail is sometimes allowed, to the claimants ; and if they decline, to the captors. But it is a proceeding adopted with extreme caution, as it opens a door to many inconveniences, and sometimes to frauds. In no case should a delivery on bail take place, until the court is fully satisfied that the appraisement is perfectly fair, and the property estimated at its full value. The ship Euphrates, 1 Gallis. C. C. R. 451. Where, on the hearing, the property is acquitted, and an appeal is interposed to a tribunal not sitting within the same jurisdiction; or into which the property does not follow the cause, (as an appeal to the supreme court of the United States,) the claimants are generally allowed a delivery of the property, or in a case of sale of the proceeds on bail. Where there is a decree of condemnation, the same rule is generally adopted, as to the captors. But it is always an application to the sound discretion of the court; and

House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That for defraying the expenses of the military establishment of the United States for the year one thousand eight hundred and twelve, for the Indian department, and for the expense of fortifications, magazines, arsenals and armories, the following sums, including the sum of one million five hundred thousand dollars already appropriated by the first section of the act, entituled "An act authorizing the purchase of ordnance and ordnance stores, camp equipage and other quartermaster's stores and small arms," be, and the same hereby are respectively appropriated; that is to say:
For the pay of the army of the United States, eight hundred and sixty-nine thousand nine hundred and sixty-eight dollars.
For forage, one hundred and four thousand six hundred and twenty four dollars.
For subsistence, six hundred and eighty-five thousand five hundred and thirty-two dollars and five cents.
For clothing, two hundred and ninety-three thousand eight hundred and four dollars.
For bounties and premiums, seventy thousand dollars.

if there be danger of injustice, the court will withhold it from either party, and content itself with retaining the property, or with ordering a sale thereof, and a deposit of the proceeds in the registry. Ibid. 452.
If a bond, taken on the delivery of property on bail, be void, as not conforming to law, the court will enforce a re-delivery of the property by attachment. The Struggle, 1 Gallis. C. C. R. 476.
A bond voluntarily given upon the delivery of property on bail, on application of the claimant, is good; although the condition does not exactly conform to the act of Congress, under which it may have been intended to take it. Ibid.

The act of Congress of 2d March, 1799, chap. 22, is not understood as compulsory on the court as to the delivery on bail. It still rests in the discretion of the court. Ibid. 477.

It is the duty of commissioners to whom it is referred to estimate damages, to make their report as specific as the nature of the thing will admit; so that not only the result, but the detail of their judgment should appear. Ibid.

In cases of restitution with damages, in prize proceedings, if in order to ascertain the damages, an inspection or a sale of the cargo be, in the judgment of the commissioner or the parties, necessary ; application should be made to the court for an order of unlivery and appraisement, or for a sale, as the case may require. Ibid.

No delivery of property on bail, in a prize cause, can be made legally, where the United States are parties, without due notice to the district attorney. Ex parte Robbins, 2 Gallis. C. C. R. 320.
If the cargo is liable to deteriorate or perish, or the ship to be injured by the delay incident to the sal. vage proceedings, the proper course is to apply to the court for a sale thereof. It is not a matter of right of either party to have a delivery on bail in such cases. The Ship Nathaniel Hooper, 3 Sumner's C. C. R. 542.

Where as , the representatives of the people of all that part of the territory or country ceded, under the name of " Louisiana," by the treaty

April 8,1812. Act of Feb. 15,1811, ch.21. Act of May 22,1812, ch. 93.

(a) The decisions of the Supreme Court on the extension of the laws of the United States to Louisiana, and the practice of the courts of the United States in the district of Louisiana, have been :--
As, by the laws of Louisiana, questions of fact in civil cases are tried by the court, unless either of the parties demand a jury, in an action of debt on a judgment, the interest on the original judgment maybe computed, and make part of the judgment in Louisiana, without a writ of inquiry, and the intervention of a jury. Mayhew v. Thatcher, 6 Wheat. 129; 5 Cond. Rep. 34.
By the treaty by which Louisiana was acquired, the United States stipulated that the inhabitants of the ceded territories should be protected in the free enjoyment of their property. The United States, as a just nation, regard this stipulation as the avowal of a principle which would have been held equally sacred, although it had not been inserted in the treaty. Soulard et al. v. The United States, 4 Peters, 511.
The term property, as applied to lands, comprehends every species of title, inchoate or complete. It is supposed to embrace those rights which lie in contract; those which are executory, as well as those which are executed. In this respect, the relation of the inhabitants of Louisiana to their government, is not changed. The new government takes the place of that which is passed away. Ibid.
By the provisions of the acts of Congress, Louisiana, when she came into the Union, had organized therein a district court of the United States, having the same jurisdiction, except as to appeals and writs of error, as the circuit courts of the United States in other states; and the modes of proceeding in that court, were required to be according to the principles, rules, and usages which belong to courts of equity, as contradistinguished from courts of common law. And whether there were or not, in the several states, courts of equity proceeding according to such principles and usages, made no difference, according to the construction uniformly given by the supreme court. Livingston v. Story, 9 Peters, 632.
The provisions of the act of Congress of 1824, relative to the practice of the courts of the United States in Louisiana, contain the descriptive term civil actions, which embrace cases at law and in equity ; and may be fairly construed as used in contradistinction to criminal causes. They apply equally to cases in equity ; and if there are any laws in Louisiana directing the mode of proceeding in equity causes, they are adopted by that act, and will govern the practice in the courts of the United States. Ibid.
Under the law of Louisiana, there are two kinds of pledges, the pawn and the antichresis. A thing is said to be pawned, when a movable is given as a security; the antichresis consists of immovables. Livingston v. Story, 11 Peters, 351.

April 8,1812. Act of Feb. 15,1811, ch.21. Act of May 22,1812, ch. 93.

(a) The decisions of the Supreme Court on the extension of the laws of the United States to Louisiana, and the practice of the courts of the United States in the district of Louisiana, have been :--
As, by the laws of Louisiana, questions of fact in civil cases are tried by the court, unless either of the parties demand a jury, in an action of debt on a judgment, the interest on the original judgment maybe computed, and make part of the judgment in Louisiana, without a writ of inquiry, and the intervention of a jury. Mayhew v. Thatcher, 6 Wheat. 129; 5 Cond. Rep. 34.
By the treaty by which Louisiana was acquired, the United States stipulated that the inhabitants of the ceded territories should be protected in the free enjoyment of their property. The United States, as a just nation, regard this stipulation as the avowal of a principle which would have been held equally sacred, although it had not been inserted in the treaty. Soulard et al. v. The United States, 4 Peters, 511.
The term property, as applied to lands, comprehends every species of title, inchoate or complete. It is supposed to embrace those rights which lie in contract; those which are executory, as well as those which are executed. In this respect, the relation of the inhabitants of Louisiana to their government, is not changed. The new government takes the place of that which is passed away. Ibid.
By the provisions of the acts of Congress, Louisiana, when she came into the Union, had organized therein a district court of the United States, having the same jurisdiction, except as to appeals and writs of error, as the circuit courts of the United States in other states; and the modes of proceeding in that court, were required to be according to the principles, rules, and usages which belong to courts of equity, as contradistinguished from courts of common law. And whether there were or not, in the several states, courts of equity proceeding according to such principles and usages, made no difference, according to the construction uniformly given by the supreme court. Livingston v. Story, 9 Peters, 632.
The provisions of the act of Congress of 1824, relative to the practice of the courts of the United States in Louisiana, contain the descriptive term civil actions, which embrace cases at law and in equity ; and may be fairly construed as used in contradistinction to criminal causes. They apply equally to cases in equity ; and if there are any laws in Louisiana directing the mode of proceeding in equity causes, they are adopted by that act, and will govern the practice in the courts of the United States. Ibid.
Under the law of Louisiana, there are two kinds of pledges, the pawn and the antichresis. A thing is said to be pawned, when a movable is given as a security; the antichresis consists of immovables. Livingston v. Story, 11 Peters, 351.

made at Paris, on the thirtieth day of April, one thousand eight hundred and three, between the United States and France, contained within the following limits, that is to say: beginning at the mouth of the river Sabine; thence, by a line to be drawn along the middle of said river, including all islands to the thirty-second degree of latitude; thence, due north, to the northernmost part of the thirty-third degree of north latitude; thence, along the said parallel of latitude, to the river Mississippi; thence, down the said river, to the river Iberville; and from thence, along the middle of the said river, and lakes Maurepas and Ponchartrain, to the gulf of Mexico; thence, bounded by the said gulf, to the place of beginning, including all islands within three leagues of the coast; did, on the twenty-second day of January, one thousand eight hundred and twelve, form for themselves a constitution and state government, and give to the said state the name of the state of Louisiana, in pursuance of an act of Congress, entituled "An act to enable the people of the territory of Orleans to form a constitution and state government, and for the admission of the said state into the Union, on an equal footing with the original states, and for other purposesAnd the

a sum of money paid to him, and took from them a counter-letter, signed by them; by which it was agreed, that on the payment of a sum stated in it, on a day stated, the property should be reconveyed by them to L.; and if not so paid, the property should be sold by an auctioneer; and, after repaying, out of the proceeds, the sum mentioned in the counter-letter, the balance should be paid to L. The money was not paid on the day appointed, and a further time was given for its payment, with additional interest and charges; and if not paid at the expiration of the time, it should be sold by an auctioneer. An agreement was at the same time made by L., that the counter-letter should be delivered up to F. and S., and cancelled. The money not being paid, it was again agreed between the parties, that if on a subsequent day fixed upon, it should not, with an additional amount for interest, &c., be paid, the property should belong absolutely to F. and S. The money was not paid, and F. and S. afterwards held the property as their own. The supreme court held this transaction to be an antichresis, according to the civil code of Louisiana: and on a bill filed in the district court of the United States, for the eastern district of Louisiana, in 1832, decreed that the rents and profits of the estate should be accounted for by S., who had become the sole owner of the property by purchase of F.'s moiety, and that the property should be sold by an auctioneer, unless the balance due S., after charging the sum due at the time last agreed upon for the payment of the money, and legal interest, with all the expenses of the estate, deducting the rents and profits, should be paid to S.; and on payment of the balance due S., the residue should be paid to the legal representative of L. Ibid.
The antichresis must be reduced to writing. The creditor acquires by this contract, the right of reaping the fruits, or other rewards of the immovables given to him in pledge, on condition of deducting, annually, their proceeds from the interest, if any be due to him, and afterwards from the principal of his debt. The creditor is bound, unless the contrary is agreed on, to pay the taxes, as well as the annual charges of the property given to him in pledge. He is likewise bound, under the penalty of damages, to provide for the keeping and necessary repairs of the pledged estate; and may lay out, from the revenues of the estate, sufficient for such expenses. Ibid.
The creditor does not become proprietor of the pledged immovables, by the failure of payment at the stated time ; any clause to the contrary is null: and in that case, it is only lawful for him to sue his debtor before the court, in order to obtain a sentence against him, and to cause the objects which have been put into his hands, to be seized and sold. Ibid.
The debtor cannot, before the full payment of his debt, claim the enjoyment of the immovables which he has given in pledge ; but the creditor, who wishes to free himself from the obligations under the antichresis, may always, unless he has renounced this right, compel the debtor to retake the enjoyment of his immovables. Ibid.
The doctrine of prescription, under the civil law, does not apply to this case, which is one of pledge ; and if it does, the time before the institution of this suit had not elapsed, in which, by the law of Louisiana, a person may sue for immovable property. Ibid.
By the contract of antichresis, the possession of the property is transferred to the person advancing the money. In case of failure to pay, the property is to be sold by judicial process: and the sum which it may bring, over the amount for which it was pledged, is to be paid to the person making the pledge. Ibid.
If any rule has been made by the district court of Louisiana, abolishing chancery practice in that court, it is a violation of those rules which the supreme court of the United States has passed to regulate the courts of equity of the United States. Those rules are as obligatory on the courts of the United States in Louisiana, as they are upon all other courts of the United States; and the only modifications or additions which can be made by the circuit or district courts, are such as shall not be inconsistent with the rules prescribed. When the rules prescribed by the supreme court do not apply, the practice of the circuit and district courts shall be regulated by the practice of the high court of chancery in England. Story v. Livingston, 13 Peters, 359.
The supreme court has said, upon more than one occasion, after mature deliberation upon able arguments of distinguished counsel against it, that the courts of the United States in Louisiana, possess equity powers under the constitution and laws of the United States. That if there are any laws in Louisiana, directing the mode of procedure in equity causes, they are adopted by the act of 26th May, 1829; and will govern the practice in the courts of the United States. But if there are no laws regulating the practice in any equity causes, the rules of chancery practice in Louisiana, mean the rules prescribed by the supreme court, for the government of the courts of the United States, under the act of Congress of May 8, 1792, chap. 36, sec. 2.

emoluments as the officers of the army of the United States. Sec . 3. And be it further enacted, That the said detachment shall not
be compelled to serve a longer time than six months after they arrive at the place of rendezvous; and during the time of their service the noncommissioned officers, musicians and privates, shall be entitled to the

The President is the sole and exclusive judge whether the exigency has arisen, in which he is authorized to call out the militia. Ibid.
Where a party justifies, in an action against him, under the orders of the President calling out the militia, it is not necessary that he should aver in his pleadings, that the exigency had actually occurred ; it is sufficient that the President has so decided, and has issued his orders ; and if the fact of the existence of the exigency were averred, it might be traversed. Ibid.
Nor is it necessary to set forth the orders of the President at large; it is sufficient to state that the call made by the governor of the state was in obedience to the orders of the President. Ibid.
A requisition from the President upon the governor, is an order, in legal intendment. Ibid. A militia man who refuses to obey the order of the President, calling him into public service, is liable to be tried for the offence, under the 5th section of the act of 1795. Ibid. The 64th of the rules and articles of war, enacted by the act of April 10, 1806, chap. 20, which provides that general courts martial may consist of any number of commissioned officers, from five to thirteen inclusively, but they shall not consist of less than thirteen where that number can be convened without manifest injury to the service, being in a matter submitted to his sound discretion, is conclusive. Ibid.
This article, however, is not obligatory in cases where the court martial is convened to try militiamen who have neglected to obey the orders of the President, calling them into public service. Ibid.
Where there is no positive statutory regulation as to the number of persons of whom the court is to be constituted, reference must be had to the general usage of the military service, or what may be called the customary military law. Ibid.
Courts martial, when duly organized, are bound to execute their duties, and regulate their modes of proceeding by this customary military law in the absence of positive enactment. Ibid.
In a case out of the operation of the articles of war, the sentence of a court martial, which has been approved by the President, is sufficiently approved. Ibid.
A court martial regularly called under the act of 1795, does not expire with the termination of the war then existing ; nor is its jurisdiction to try offences in any way dependent upon the fact of war or peace. Ibid.
Where, in an action of replevin, the defendant being a deputy marshal of the United States, avowed and justified the taking of the plaintiff's goods, by virtue of a warrant issued to the marshal of the district, to collect a fine imposed by the judgment of a court martial, described as a general court martial, composed of officers of the militia of the state of New York, in the service of the United States, (six in number, and naming them,) duly organized and convened by general orders issued pursuant to the act of Congress of February 28, 1795, chap. 36, for the trial of those of the militia of the state of New York, ordered into the service of the United States, in the third military district, who had refused to rendezvous and enter into the service of the United States, in obedience to the order of the commander in chief of the state of New York, of the 4th and 29th of August, 1814, issued in compliance with the requisition of the President, made in pursuance of the same act of Congress ; and alleging that the plaintiff being a private in the militia, neglected and refused to rendezvous, &c.; and was regularly tried by the said general court martial, and duly convicted of the said delinquency: Held, that the avowry was good. Ibid.
Alien enemies, who had enrolled themselves as volunteers, and been accepted by the President, under the act of February 6th, 1812, chap. 21, are not entitled to a discharge on the ground of such alienage; there being no law enjoining the President from accepting their services. Wilson et al. v. Izard et al., Paine's C. C. R. 68.
It seems that the President had a right to accept volunteers to serve at a particular post, as well as for general service; the act being silent on the subject: at any rate, he had a discretion on the subject, not to be controlled by a court of justice. Ibid.
The insertion in the enrolment, of the officer's name, under whom the volunteers were to serve, was meant merely to ascertain the post where they were to serve, by designating its commander; and not to attach them to his personal command, so that he could not be changed. Ibid.

repeal the act now in force for those purposes, passed the twenty-eighth day of February, one thousand seven hundred and ninety-five;" and if a part only of said detachment shall be called into actual service, they shall be taken from such part thereof, as the President of the United States shall deem proper.
Sec . 5. And be it further enacted, That no non-commissioned officer, musician or private belonging to the aforesaid detachment of militia, who shall be ordered into actual service by the President of the United
States, shall be subject to corporal punishment by whipping, any thing contained in any act to the contrary notwithstanding.

And be it further enacted, That any non-commissioned officer or private belonging to the aforesaid detachment of militia, who shall, while in actual service, be convicted before any court martial of any offence, which before the passing of this act might or could have subjected such person to be whipped, shall, for the first offence, be put under such stoppages of pay as such court martial shall adjudge, not exceeding the one half of one month's pay for any one offence; but such offender may, moreover, at the discretion of such court martial, be confined under guard, on allowance of half rations, any length of time, not exceeding ten days for any one offence, or may, at the discretion of such court martial, be publicly drummed out of the army.

18,1814, ch. 85. Act of May 8,
1822, ch. 12'8.

(a) On the 12th February,1813, Congress passed an " act authorizing the President of the United States to take possession of a tract of country lying south of the Mississippi territory, and west of the river Perdido." This act was not promulgated until the publication of the " Session acts " of the first session of the fifteenth Congress, which terminated April 20, 1818. See " resolution and acts relative to the occupation of Florida by the United States," Appendix to the acts of the first session of the fifteenth Congress, 1818, Vol. 3, p. 472.
Upon the titles to lands in this country, the following decisions have been made by the Supreme Court:--

By the treaty of St. Ildefonso, made on the 1st of October, 1800, Spain ceded Louisiana to France; and France, by the treaty of Paris, signed the 30th of April, 1803, ceded it to the United States. Under this treaty, the United States claimed the countries between the Iberville and the Perdido. Spain contended that her cession to France comprehended only that territory which at the time of the cession was denominated Louisiana, consisting of the island of New Orleans, and the country which had been originally ceded to her by France, west of the Mississippi. The land claimed by the plaintiffs in error, under a grant from the crown of Spain, made after the treaty of St. Ildefonso, lies within the disputed territory; and this case presents the question, to whom did the country between the Iberville and Perdido belong after the treaty of St. Ildefonso ? Had France and Spain agreed upon the boundaries of the retroceded territory before Louisiana was acquired by the United States; that agreement would undoubtedly have ascertained its limits. But the declarations of France, made after parting with the province, cannot be admitted as conclusive. In questions of this character, political considerations have too much influence over the conduct of nations, to permit their declarations to decide the course of an independent government, in a matter vitally interesting to itself. Foster et al. v. Neilson, 2 Peters, 306.
If a Spanish grantee had obtained possession of the land in dispute so as to be the defendant, would a court of the United States maintain his title under a Spanish grant, made subsequent to the acquisition of Louisiana, singly on the principle that the Spanish construction of the treaty of St. Ildefonso was right, and the American construction wrong ? Such a decision would subvert those principles which govern the relations between the legislative and judicial departments, and mark the limits of each. Ibid. 309.

The sound construction of the 8th article of the treaty between the United States and Spain, of the 22d

of February, 1829, will not enable the court to apply its provisions to the case of the plaintiff. Ibid. 314.

The article does not declare that all the grants made by his Catholic Majesty before the 24th January,

1818, shall be valid to the same extent as if the ceded territories had remained under his dominion. It

does not say that those grants are hereby confirmed. Had such been its language, it would have acted

directly on the subject, and it would have repealed those acts of Congress which were repugnant to it;

but its language is, that those grants shall be ratified and confirmed to the persons in possession, &c.

By whom shall they be ratified and confirmed ? This seems to be the language of contract; and if it is,

the ratification and confirmation which are promised must be the act of the legislature. Until such act

shall be passed, the court is not at liberty to disregard the existing laws on the subject. Ibid,

April 25, 1812. Act of April
18,1814, ch. 85. Act of May 8,
1822, ch. 12'8.

(a) On the 12th February,1813, Congress passed an " act authorizing the President of the United States to take possession of a tract of country lying south of the Mississippi territory, and west of the river Perdido." This act was not promulgated until the publication of the " Session acts " of the first session of the fifteenth Congress, which terminated April 20, 1818. See " resolution and acts relative to the occupation of Florida by the United States," Appendix to the acts of the first session of the fifteenth Congress, 1818, Vol. 3, p. 472.
Upon the titles to lands in this country, the following decisions have been made by the Supreme Court:--

By the treaty of St. Ildefonso, made on the 1st of October, 1800, Spain ceded Louisiana to France; and France, by the treaty of Paris, signed the 30th of April, 1803, ceded it to the United States. Under this treaty, the United States claimed the countries between the Iberville and the Perdido. Spain contended that her cession to France comprehended only that territory which at the time of the cession was denominated Louisiana, consisting of the island of New Orleans, and the country which had been originally ceded to her by France, west of the Mississippi. The land claimed by the plaintiffs in error, under a grant from the crown of Spain, made after the treaty of St. Ildefonso, lies within the disputed territory; and this case presents the question, to whom did the country between the Iberville and Perdido belong after the treaty of St. Ildefonso ? Had France and Spain agreed upon the boundaries of the retroceded territory before Louisiana was acquired by the United States; that agreement would undoubtedly have ascertained its limits. But the declarations of France, made after parting with the province, cannot be admitted as conclusive. In questions of this character, political considerations have too much influence over the conduct of nations, to permit their declarations to decide the course of an independent government, in a matter vitally interesting to itself. Foster et al. v. Neilson, 2 Peters, 306.
If a Spanish grantee had obtained possession of the land in dispute so as to be the defendant, would a court of the United States maintain his title under a Spanish grant, made subsequent to the acquisition of Louisiana, singly on the principle that the Spanish construction of the treaty of St. Ildefonso was right, and the American construction wrong ? Such a decision would subvert those principles which govern the relations between the legislative and judicial departments, and mark the limits of each. Ibid. 309.

The sound construction of the 8th article of the treaty between the United States and Spain, of the 22d

of February, 1829, will not enable the court to apply its provisions to the case of the plaintiff. Ibid. 314.

The article does not declare that all the grants made by his Catholic Majesty before the 24th January,

1818, shall be valid to the same extent as if the ceded territories had remained under his dominion. It

does not say that those grants are hereby confirmed. Had such been its language, it would have acted

directly on the subject, and it would have repealed those acts of Congress which were repugnant to it;

but its language is, that those grants shall be ratified and confirmed to the persons in possession, &c.

By whom shall they be ratified and confirmed ? This seems to be the language of contract; and if it is,

the ratification and confirmation which are promised must be the act of the legislature. Until such act

shall be passed, the court is not at liberty to disregard the existing laws on the subject. Ibid,

Twenty days' notice to be given.

taining the titles and claims to lands in that tract of country which lies south of the Mississippi territory, east of the river Mississippi and island of New Orleans, and west of the river Perdido, and a line drawn with
the general course thereof to the southern boundary of the said Mississippi territory, the lands within the said limits shall be laid off into two
land districts, between which Pearl river shall be the boundary; and for each of which districts a commissioner for land claims shall be appointed
by the President of the United States, with the advice and consent of the Senate. The said commissioners shall, respectively, have power to appoint a clerk, who shall be a person capable of translating the French and Spanish languages, and who shall, in addition to the other duties required of him by this act, perforin the duties of translator, when required by the commissioner. And the said commissioners and clerk shall, before entering on the duties of their appointments, respectively take an oath or affirmation, truly and faithfully to execute the duties
imposed on them by this act. Sec . 2. And be it further enacted, That for the more convenient
ascertainment of the titles and claims to lands as aforesaid, it shall be the duty of each of the said commissioners, respectively, and their clerks, to attend in each of the several parishes in his district, at such time and place therein as he shall appoint, for the purpose of receiving notices and evidences of titles and claims to lands within the same; and when
the commissioners shall have appointed the time and place for his attendance in any parish, he shall cause public notice thereof to be given to the inhabitants of the same, for at least twenty days previous to
the time of his commencing the business of his appointment therein. Sec . 3. And be it further enacted, That each commissioner, after he
shall have attended for a reasonable and sufficient length of time in each parish of his district, for the claimants of lands within the same to have

Congress, in order to guard against imposition, declared, by the law of 1804, that all grants of land made by the Spanish authorities in the territory west of the Perdido, after the treaty of St. Ildefonso, should be null and void, excepting those to actual settlers, acquired before December 20, 1803. Garcia v. Lee, 12 Peters, 511.
The controversy relative to the country lying between the Mississippi and the Perdido rivers, and the validity of the grants made by Spain in the disputed territory after the cession of Louisiana to the United States, were carefully examined in the case of Foster & Elam v. Neilson. The supreme court, in that case, decided that the question of boundary between the United States and Spain was a question for the political departments of the government: that the legislative and executive branches having decided the question, the courts of the United States are bound to regard the boundary determined by them as the true one ; that grants made by the Spanish authorities of lands, which, according to this boundary line, belonged to the United States, gave no title to the grantees, in opposition to those claiming under the United States; unless the Spanish grants were protected by the subsequent arrangements made between the two governments ; and that no such arrangements were to be found in the treaty of 1819, by which Spain ceded the Floridas to the United States, according to the fair import of its words, and its true construction. Ibid.
In the case of Foster & Elam v. Neilson, the supreme court said that the Florida treaty of 1819, declares that all grants made before the 24th of January, 1818, by the Spanish authorities, " shall be ratified and confirmed to the persons in possession of the lands, to the same extent that the same grants would be valid, if the territories had remained under the dominion of his Catholic Majesty:" and in deciding the case of Foster & Elam, the court held, that even if this stipulation applied to lands in the territory in question, yet the words used did not import a present confirmation by virtue of the treaty itself, but that they were words of contract: " that the ratification and confirmation which were promised, must be the act of the legislature ; and until such shall be passed, the court is not at liberty to disregard the existing laws on the subject." Afterwards, in the case of the United States v. Percheman, 7 Peters, 86, in reviewing the words of the 8th article of the treaty; the court, for the reasons there assigned, came to a different conclusion ; and held, that the words were words of present confirmation, by the treaty, where the land had been rightfully granted before the cession ; and that it did not need the aid of an act of Congress to ratify and confirm the grant. This language was, however, applied by the court, and was intended to apply to grants made in a territory which belonged to Spain at the time of the grant. The case then before the court was one of that description. It was in relation to a grant of land in Florida, which unquestionably belonged to Spain at the time the grant was made; and where the Spanish authorities had an undoubted right to grant, until the treaty of cession in 1819. It is of such grants that the court speak, when they declare them to be confirmed and protected by the true construction of the treaty; and that they do not need the aid of an act of Congress to ratify and confirm the title of the purchaser. The court do not apply this principle to grants made within the territory of Louisiana. The case of Foster & Elam v. Neilson must, in all other respects, be considered as affirmed by the case of Percheman ; as it underwent a careful examination in that case, and as none of its principles were questioned except that referred to.

And if such person shall neglect to deliver such notice in writing of his claim, together with the plat (in case the lands claimed shall have been surveyed) as aforesaid, or cause to be recorded such written evidence of the same within the time and times as aforesaid, his claim shall never after be recognized or confirmed by the United States; nor shall any grant, order of survey, deed, conveyance, or other written evidence, which shall not be recorded as above directed, ever after be considered or admitted as evidence in any court of the United States, against any grant which may hereafter be derived from the United States.
Sec . 5. And be it further enacted, That the said commissioners shall have power, in their respective districts, to inquire into the justice and validity of the claims filed with them as aforesaid : it shall be their duty to ascertain in every case, whether the lands claimed have been inha-
bited and cultivated; at what time such inhabitation and cultivation commenced; when surveyed, and by whom and what authority; and into every other matter respecting the claims which may affect the justice and validity thereof; and for that purpose shall have power to administer oaths, and to compel the attendance of, and examine witnesses and such other testimony as may be adduced; to have access to all records of a public nature, relative to the granting, sale, transfer or titles of lands within their respective districts, and to take transcripts from such record or records or any part thereof; and the evidence thus adduced and obtained, shall, by the clerk, be entered in a book to be kept for that purpose.

In 1822, Congress passed an act authorizing the corporation of Washington to drain the ground in and

near certain public reservations, and to improve and ornament certain parts of the public reservations. The corporation are empowered to make an agreement, by which parts of the location of the canal shall

be changed, for the purpose of draining and drying the low grounds near the Pennsylvania avenue, &c.

To effect these objects, the corporation is authorized to lay off in building lots certain parts of the public

Act of May 15, 1820, ch. 81.

be composed of a mayor, a board of aidermen and a board of common council, to be elected by ballot, as herein after directed. The board of aldermen shall consist of eight members, to be elected for two years, two to be residents of and chosen from each ward by the qualified voters resident therein: and the board of common council shall consist of

reservations, No. 10, 11, and 12, and of other squares, and also a part of B. street, as laid out and designated in the original plan of the city, which lots they may sell at auction, and apply the proceeds to those objects, and afterwards to enclosing, planting and improving other reservations, and building bridges, &c.; the surplus, if any, to be paid into the treasury of the United States. The act authorizes the heirs, &c. of the former proprietors of the land on which the city was laid out, who may consider themselves injured by the purposes of the act, to institute in the circuit court a bill in equity, in the nature of a petition of right, against the United States, setting forth the grounds of any claim they may consider themselves entitled to make, to be conducted according to the rules of a court of equity; the court to hear and determine upon the claim of the plaintiffs, and what portion, if any, of the money arising from the sale of the lots they may be entitled to, with a right of appeal to the supreme court. The plaintiffs, Van Ness and wife, filed in the circuit court their bill against the United States and the corporation of Washington, claiming title to the lots which had been thus sold, under David Burns, the original proprietor of that part of the city, and father of one of the plaintiffs, on the ground that by the agreement between the United States and the original proprietors, upon laying out the city, those reservations and streets were, for ever, to remain for public use ; and, without the consent of the proprietors, could not be otherwise appropriated or sold for private use ; that the act of Congress was a violation of that contract; that by such sale and appropriation for private use the right of the United States thereto was determined, or that the original proprietors re-acquired a right to have the reservations, &c. laid out in building lots for their joint and equal benefit with the United States, or that they were in equity entitled to the whole or a moiety of the proceeds of the sales of the lots. Held, by the supreme court, that no rights or claims exist in the former proprietors or their heirs, and that the proceedings of the corporation of Washington, under and in conformity with the provisions of the act, are valid and effectual for the purposes of the act. Van Ness et al. v. The City of Washington and the United States, 4 Peters, 232.
The official tax books of the corporation of Washington, made up by the register from the original returns or lists of the assessors laid before the court of appeals, he being empowered by the ordinances of the corporation to correct the valuations made by the assessors, are evidence ; and it is not required that the assessor's original lists shall be produced in evidence, to prove the assessment of the taxes on real estate in the city of Washington. Ronkendorf v. Taylor's Lessee, 4 Peters, 349.
In an ex parte proceeding, as a sale of land for taxes under a special authority, great strictness is required. To divest an individual of his property against his consent, every substantia] requisite of the law must be complied with. No presumption can be raised, in behalf of a collector who sells real estate for taxes, to cure any radical defect in his proceedings ; and the proof of regularity devolves upon the person who claims under the collector's sale. Ibid.
Proof of the regular appointment of the assessors is not necessary. They acted under the authority of the corporation, and the highest evidence of this fact is the sanction given to their returns. Ibid.
The act of Congress, under which the lot in the city of Washington in controversy was sold, required that public notice of the time and place of sale of lots, the property of non-residents, should be given, by advertising " once a week" in some newspaper in the city for three months. Notice of the sale of the lot in controversy was published for three months; but in the course of that period, eleven days at one time, at another ten days, and at another eight days transpired in succeeding weeks, between the insertions of the advertisement in the newspapers. "A week " is a definite period of time, commencing on Sunday and ending on Saturday. The notice was published Monday, January 6th, and was omitted until Saturday, January 18th, leaving an interval of eleven days. Still the publication on Saturday was within the week preceding the notice of the 6th ; and this was sufficient. It would be a most rigid construction of the act of Congress, justified neither by its spirit nor its language, to say that this notice must be published on any particular day of a week. If published once a week for three months, the law is complied with, and its object effectuated. Ibid.
No doubt can exist that a part of a lot may be sold for taxes, where they have accrued on such part. Ibid.
The lot on which the taxes were assessed, belonged to two persons as tenants in common. The assessment was made by a valuation of each half of the lot. To make a sale of the interest of one tenant in common for unpaid taxes valid, it need not extend to the interest of both claimants ; one having paid his tax, the interest of the other may well be sold for the balance. Ibid.
The advertisement purported to sell " half of lot No. 4, in square No. 491;a"nd the other half was advertised in the same manner, as belonging to the other tenant in common. This was not a sufficient advertisement; and a sale made under the same was void. It is not sufficient that in an advertisement of land for sale for unpaid taxes, such a description is given as would enable the persons desirous of purchasing, to ascertain the situation of the property by inquiry ; nor, if the purchaser, at the sale, had been informed of every fact necessary to enable him to fix a value upon the property, would the sale be valid, unless the same information had been communicated to the public in the notice. Ibid.
The 10th section of the act of Congress provides that real property in Washington, on which two or more years' taxes shall be due and unpaid, may be sold, &c. In this section a distinction is made between a general and a special tax. Property may be sold to pay the former as soon as two years' tax shall be due; but to pay the latter, property cannot be sold until the expiration of two years after the second year's tax becomes due. The taxes for which the property in controversy was sold, became due, by the ordinance of the corporation, on the 1st day of January, 1821 and 1822. The special tax for paving was charged against the lot in 1820, and became due on the first of January, 1821; but the ground on which it was assessed, was not liable to be sold for the tax until the 1st of January, 1823. The first notice of the sale was given on the 6th of December, 1822, nearly a month before the lot was liable to be sold for the special tax of 1820. Held, by the supreme court, that the whole period should have elapsed, which was necessary to render the lot liable to be sold for the special tax, before the advertisement was published, Ibid.

A majority of each board shall be necessary to form a quorum to do business, but a less number may adjourn from day to day. The board of aldermen, immediately after they shall have assembled in consequence of the first election shall

And every free white male citizen of lawful age, who shall have resided in the city of Washington for the space of one year next preceding the day of election, and shall be a resident of the ward in which he
shall offer to vote, and who shall have been assessed on the books of the corporation not less than two months prior to the day of election, shall be qualified to vote for members to serve in the said board of aldermen and board of common council, and no other person whatever shall exer-
cise the right of suffrage at such election. Sec . 3. And be it further enacted, That the present mayor of the city
of Washington shall be, and continue such until the second Monday in June next, on which day, and on the second Monday in June annually thereafter, the mayor of the said city shall be elected by ballot of the board of aldermen and board of common council in joint meeting, and a majority of the votes of all the members of both boards shall be necessary to a choice; and if there should be an equality of votes between two persons, after the third ballot, the two boards shall determine the choice by lot. He shall, before he enters upon the duties of his office, take an oath or affirmation, in the presence of both boards, " lawfully to execute the duties of his office to the best of his skill and judgment, without favour or partiality." He shall, ex-officio, have and exercise all the powers, authority and jurisdiction of a justice of the peace for the county of Washington, within the said county. He shall nominate, and, with the consent of a majority of the members of the board of aldermen, appoint to all offices under the corporation, (except the commissioners of election,) and any such officer shall be removed from office on the concurrent remonstrance of a majority of the two boards. He shall see that the laws of the corporation be duly executed, and shall report the negligence or misconduct of any officer to the two boards. He shall appoint proper persons to fill up all vacancies during the recess of the board of aldermen, to hold such appointment until the end of the then ensuing session. He shall have power to convene the two boards, when in his opinion the good of the community may require it; and he shall lay before them from time to time, in writing, such alterations in the laws of the corporation, as he shall deem necessary or proper, and shall receive for his services annually, a just and reasonable compensation,

Any person shall be eligible to the office of mayor, who is a free white male citizen of the United States, who shall have attained to the age of thirty years, and who shall be the bona fide owner of a freehold estate in the said city, and shall have been resident in the said city two years immediately preceding his election : and no other person shall be eligible to the said office. In case of the refusal of any person to accept the office of mayor upon his election thereto, or of his death, resignation, inability or removal from the city, the said two boards shall elect another in his place to serve the remainder of the year.
Sec . 4. And be it further enacted, That the first election for members of the board of aldermen and board of common council, shall be held
on the first Monday in June next, and on the first Monday in June annually thereafter: the first election to be held by three commissioners, to be appointed in each ward by the mayor of the city, and at such place in each ward as he may direct; and all subsequent elections shall be held by a like number of commissioners, to be appointed in each ward by the two boards in joint meeting, which several appointments, except the first,
shall be at least ten days previous to the day of each election. And it shall be the duty of the mayor, for the first election, and of the commissioners for all subsequent elections, to give at least five days' previous public notice of the place in each ward where such elections are to be held. The said commissioners shall, before they receive any ballot, severally take the following oath or affirmation, to be administered by the mayor of the city or any justice of the peace for the county of Wash-
ington : " I, A. B. do solemnly swear, or affirm (as the case may be), that I will truly and faithfully receive and return the votes of such persons as are by law entitled to vote for members of the board of aldermen and board of common council in ward, No. according to the best of my
judgment and understanding; and that I will not, knowingly, receive or return the vote of any person who is not legally entitled to the same, so help me God." The polls shall be opened at ten o'clock in the morning, and be closed at seven o'clock in the evening of the same day. Immediately on closing the polls, the commissioners of each ward, or a majority of them, shall count the ballots and make out under their hands and seals a correct return of the two persons for the first election, and of the one person for all subsequent elections, having the greatest number of legal votes, together with the number of votes given to each, as members of the board of aldermen; and of the three persons having the greatest number of legal votes, together with the number of votes given to each, as members of the board of common council; and the two persons at the first election and the one person at all subsequent elections, having the greatest number of legal votes for the board of aldermen; and the
three persons having the greatest number of legal votes for the board of common council, shall be duly elected ; and in all cases of an equality of votes the commissioners shall decide by lot. The said returns shall be delivered to the mayor of the city on the succeeding day, who shall cause the same to be published in some newspaper printed in the city of Washington. A duplicate return,together with a list of the persons who voted at such election, shall also be made by the said commissioners to the register of the city, on the day succeeding the election, who shall preserve and record the same; and shall, within two days thereafter, notify the several persons so returned, of their election. And each board shall judge the legality of the elections, returns and qualifications of its own members; and shall supply vacancies in its own body, by
causing elections to be made to fill the same in the ward and for the board in which such vacancies shall happen, giving at least five days'
notice previous thereto; and each board shall have full power to pass all

mayor or some justice of the peace for the county of Washington.

Sec . 5. And be it further enacted, That in addition to the powers

(a) Land titles in Missouri:-- The state of Missouri was formerly part of the territory, first of France, next of Spain, then of France, who ceded it to the United States by the treaty of 1803, in full propriety, sovereignty and dominion, as she had acquired and held it; by which this government put itself in place of the former sovereigns, and became invested with all their rights, subject to their concomitant obligations to the inhabitants. Both were regulated by the law of nations, according to which the rights of property are protected, even in the case of a conquered country, and held sacred and inviolable when it is ceded by treaty, with or without any stipulation to such effect; and the laws, whether in writing, or evidenced by the usage and customs of the conquered or ceded country, continue in force, until altered by the new sovereign. Strother v. Lucas, 12 Peters, 410. No principle can be better established by the authority of the supreme court, than "that the acts of an officer, to whom a public duty is assigned by his king, within the sphere of that duty, are prima facie taken to be within his power." The principles on which it rests, are believed to be too deeply founded in law and reason, ever to be successfully assailed. He who would controvert a grant executed by the lawful authority, with all the solemnities required by law, takes on himself the burthen of showing that the officer has transcended the powers conferred upon him; or that the transaction is tainted with fraud. Ibid.
Where the act of an officer to pass the title to land according to the Spanish law, is done contrary to the written order of the king, produced at the trial, without any explanation, it shall be presumed that the power has not been exceeded : that the act was done on the motive set out therein ; and according to some order known to the king and his officers, though not to his subjects : and courts ought to require very full proof, that he had transcended his powers, before they so determine it. Ibid.
In favour of long possession and ancient appropriation, every thing which was done shall be presumed to have been rightfully done ; and though it does not appear to have been done, the law will presume that whatever was necessary has been done. Ibid.

in the territory of Missouri.(a)
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the rights, titles and

(a) Land titles in Missouri:-- The state of Missouri was formerly part of the territory, first of France, next of Spain, then of France, who ceded it to the United States by the treaty of 1803, in full propriety, sovereignty and dominion, as she had acquired and held it; by which this government put itself in place of the former sovereigns, and became invested with all their rights, subject to their concomitant obligations to the inhabitants. Both were regulated by the law of nations, according to which the rights of property are protected, even in the case of a conquered country, and held sacred and inviolable when it is ceded by treaty, with or without any stipulation to such effect; and the laws, whether in writing, or evidenced by the usage and customs of the conquered or ceded country, continue in force, until altered by the new sovereign. Strother v. Lucas, 12 Peters, 410. No principle can be better established by the authority of the supreme court, than "that the acts of an officer, to whom a public duty is assigned by his king, within the sphere of that duty, are prima facie taken to be within his power." The principles on which it rests, are believed to be too deeply founded in law and reason, ever to be successfully assailed. He who would controvert a grant executed by the lawful authority, with all the solemnities required by law, takes on himself the burthen of showing that the officer has transcended the powers conferred upon him; or that the transaction is tainted with fraud. Ibid.
Where the act of an officer to pass the title to land according to the Spanish law, is done contrary to the written order of the king, produced at the trial, without any explanation, it shall be presumed that the power has not been exceeded : that the act was done on the motive set out therein ; and according to some order known to the king and his officers, though not to his subjects : and courts ought to require very full proof, that he had transcended his powers, before they so determine it. Ibid.
In favour of long possession and ancient appropriation, every thing which was done shall be presumed to have been rightfully done ; and though it does not appear to have been done, the law will presume that whatever was necessary has been done. Ibid.
The stipulations of the treaty ceding Louisiana to the United States, affording that protection or security to claims under the French or Spanish government to which the act of Congress refers, are in the first, second and third articles. They extended to all property until Louisiana became a member of the Union; into which the inhabitants were to be incorporated as soon as possible, "and admitted to all the

rights, advantages and immunities of citizens of the United States.?' The perfect inviolability and security of property is among these rights. Delassus v. The United States, 9 Peters, 117.
The right of property is protected and secured by the treaty, and no principle is better settled in this country, than that an inchoate title to lands is property. This right would have been sacred, independent of the treaty. The sovereign who acquires an inhabited country, acquires full dominion over it; but this dominion is never supposed to divest the vested rights of individuals to property. The language of the treaty ceding Louisiana, excludes any idea of interfering with private property. Ibid.
On the 18th of April, 1802, the lieutenant-governor of Upper Louisiana granted sixteen hundred arpents of land near certain rivers named in the grant, with directions to survey the same in a vacant place of the royal domain ; but no survey was made before the cession of Louisiana to the United States. By the Court--As the grant contained no description of the land granted, and was not located within the time prescribed by the act' of Congress of the 10th of March, 1804, it comes directly within the point decided by the supreme court in the case of John Smith, T., and cannot be confirmed. Wherry v. The United States, 10 Peters, 338.
In repeated decisions, the supreme court have affirmed the authority of local governors, under the crown of Spain, to grant land in Louisiana, before the same was ceded by Spain to France: and the court have also affirmed the validity of descriptive grants, though not surveyed before the 11th of March, 1804, in Missouri, and the 24th of January, 1818, in Florida. Mackey v. The United States, 10 Peters, 340.
A grant or concession made by an officer who is by law authorized to make it, carries with it prima facie evidence that it is within his powers. .No excess of them, or departure from them, is to be presumed. He violates his duty by such excess, and is responsible for it. He who alleges that an officer entrusted with an important duty has violated his instructions, must show it. Delassus v. The United States, 9 Peters, 117.
The instructions of governor O'Reilly, relative to granting lands in Louisiana, were considered by the court, in 8 Peters, 455. These regulations were intended for the general government of subordinate officers, and not to control and limit the power of the person from whose will they emanated. The Baron De Carondelet must be supposed to have had all the powers which had been vested in Don O'Reilly; and a concession ordered by him is as valid as a similar concession directed by governor O'Reilly would have been. Ibid.
A concession of land was made by the lieutenant-governor of Upper Louisiana, at the time when the power of granting lands was vested in the governors of provinces. This power was, in 1799, after the concession, transferred to the intendant-general; and after this transfer, in January, 1800, the order of survey of the land was made by the lieutenant-governor. The validity of the order of survey depends on the authority of the lieutenant-governor to make it. The lieutenant-governor was also a sub-delegate, and as such was empowered to make inchoate grants. The grant was confirmed. Chouteau's heirs v. The United States, 9 Peters, 137.
The transfer of the power to make concessions of lands belonging to the royal domain of Spain, from the governor-general to the intendant-general, did not affect the power of the sub-delegate, who made this concession. The order in this case is the foundation of title, and is, according to the act of Congress on the subject of confirming titles to lands in Missouri, &c., and the general understanding and usage of Louisiana and Missouri, capable of being perfected into a complete title. It is property, capable of being alienated, of being subjected to debts : and is, as such, to be held as sacred and inviolate as other property. Ibid.
A concession of one league square of land, in Upper Louisiana, was made by Don Zenon Trudeau, the lieutenant-governor of that province, to Auguste Chouteau, and a decree made by him directing the surveyor-general of the province to put him in possession of the land, and to survey the same, in order to enable Chouteau to solicit a complete title thereto from the governor-general, who by the said decree was informed that the circumstances of Chouteau were such as entitled him to a grant of the land. The land was surveyed, and the grantee put in full possession of it on the 20th of December, 1803. He retained possession of it until his death. The objection to the validity of the concession was, that the petitioner had not as many tame cattle as the eighth regulation of governor O'Reilly, governor-general of Louisiana, required. That regulation required that the applicant for a grant of a league square of land should make it appear that he is possessed of one hundred head of tame cattle, some horses and sheep, and two slaves to look after them, a proportion which shall always be observed for the grants, &c. By the Court--"In the spirit of the decisions which have been heretofore made by the supreme court, and of the acts of confirmation passed by Congress, the fact that the applicant possessed the requisite amount of property to entitle him to the land he solicited, was submitted to the officer who decided on the application ; and he is not bound to prove it to the court, which passes on the validity of the grant. These incomplete titles were transferable, and the assignee might not possess the means of proving the exact number of cattle in possession of the petitioner when the concession was made." The grant was confirmed. Ibid. 147.
If the court can trust the information received on this subject, neither the governor nor the intendantgeneral has ever refused to perfect an incomplete title granted by a deputy governor or a sub-delegate. Ibid.
The regulation made by Don O'Reilly, as to the quantity of land to be granted to an individual, is not that no individual shall receive grants for more than one league square, but that no grant shall exceed a league square. The words of the regulation do not forbid different grants to the same person ; and, so far as the court are informed, it has never been so construed. Ibid.
The act of Congress passed 13th June, 1812, confirming the titles and claims of certain towns and villages to village lots and commons, gave a title which is paramount to a title held under an old Spanish concession confirmed by Congress in 1836. Chouteau v. Eckhart, 2 Howard, 344.

And be it further enacted, That every claim to a donation of lands in the said territory, in virtue of settlement and cultivation, which is embraced by the report of the commissioners, transmitted to the Secretary of the Treasury, and which by the said report, shall appear not to have been confirmed, merely because permission, by the proper Spanish officer, to settle, has not been duly proven; or because the tract claimed, although inhabited, was not cultivated on the twentieth of December, one thousand eight hundred and three, or not to have been confirmed on account of both said causes; the same shall be confirmed, in case it shall appear that the tract so claimed was inhabited by the claimant or some one for his use prior to the twentieth day of December, one thousand eight hundred and three as aforesaid, and cultivated in eight months thereafter, subject, however, to every other limitation
and restriction prescribed by former laws in respect to such claims; and in all cases where it shall appear by the said report or other records of the board that claims to land have not been confirmed merely on the ground that the claim was for a greater quantity than eight hundred arpens, French measure, every such claim to the extent of eight hundred arpens, shall be confirmed.

by law for the other lands of the United States. Sec . 5. And be it further enacted, That the principal deputy surveyor
shall survey, or cause to be surveyed, under the direction of the surveyor general, so much of the lands in the said territory, to which the Indian title has been extinguished, as the President of the United States may direct, into townships of six miles square, by lines running due north and south, and others crossing these at right angles; and also the lands, the claims to which are directed to be confirmed, by the third section of this act; and the lands, the claims to which have been confirmed by the board of commissioners, where the same has not already been surveyed under the authority of the United States. And the said principal deputy surveyor shall make out a general and connected plat of all the surveys directed by this act to be made, or which have already been made under the authority of the United States, which he shall transmit to the surveyor general, who shall transmit copies of the said plat or plats to the recorder of land titles and the commissioner of the general land-office.

Proviso. Suit or action may be removed from one county to another.
Prosecution by information or indictment may also be removed, on suggestion of the district attorney.
Slaves may be removed from one county to another.

(a) Slavery in the District of Columbia :-- The plaintiffs in error filed a petition for freedom in the circuit court of the United States for the county of Washington, and they proved that they were born in the state of Virginia, as slaves of Richard B. Lee, now deceased, who moved with his family into the county of Washington, in the District of Columbia, about the year 1816, leaving the petitioners residing in Virginia as his slaves, until the year 1820, when the petitioner Barbara was removed to the county of Alexandria, in the District of Columbia, where she was hired to Mrs. Muir, and continued with her thus hired for the period of one year. That the petitioner, Sam, was in like manner removed to the county of Alexandria, and was hired to General Walter Jones, for a period of about five or six months. That after the expiration of the said periods of hiring, the petitioners were removed to the said county of Washington, where they continued to reside as the slaves of the said Richard B. Lee until his death, and since, as the slaves of his widow, the defendant. On the part of the defendant in error, a preliminary objection was made to the jurisdiction of the supreme court, growing out of the act of Congress of the 2d of April, 1816, which declares that no cause shall be removed from the circuit court for the District of Columbia, to the supreme court, by appeal or writ of error, unless the matter in dispute shall be of the value of one thousand dollars, or upwaids. By the Court--The matter in dispute in this case, is the freedom of the petitioners. The judgment of the court below is against their claims to freedom ; the matter in dispute, is, therefore, to the plaintiffs in error, the value of their freedom, and this is not susceptible of a pecuniary valuation. Had the judgment been in favour of the petitioners, and the writ of error brought by the party claiming to be the owner, the value of the slaves as property, would have been the matter in dispute, and affidavits might be admitted to ascertain such value. But affidavits, estimating the value of freedom, are entirely inadmissible, and no doubt is entertained of the jurisdiction of the court. Lee v. Lee, 8 Peters, 44. The circuit court refused to instruct the jury that if they should believe, from the evidence, that bringing the petitioners from Virginia to Alexandria, by their owner, and hiring them there, was merely colourable, with intent to evade the law, that then the petitioners are entitled to their freedom. By the Maryland law, of 1796, it was declared, that it shall not be lawful to import or bring into this state, by land or water, any negro, mulatto, or other slave, for sale, or to reside within this state; and any person brought into this state as a slave, contrary to this act, if a slave before, shall thereupon cease to be the property of the person so importing, and shall be free. And by the act of Congress of the 27th of February, 1801, it is provided, that the laws of the state of Maryland, as they then existed, should be, and continue in force in that part of the district which was ceded by that state to the United States.

Persons obtaining letters testamentary, or of administration out of the district of Columbia, may prosecute claims within it.
Certified copies of letters testamentary, &c. to be evidence.
Sessions ofthe courts of Alexandria, to be held in April and November.

Sec . 10. And be it further enacted, That in paying the debts of any deceased person, the executor or administrator, who shall hereafter qualify and obtain letters testamentary or of administration in the orphans' court in the county of Alexandria, shall observe the following rules; funeral expenses shall be first paid, next judgments and decrees against the deceased obtained in his lifetime in the said district shall be wholly discharged before any other claims; after such funeral expenses, judgments and decrees within the said district shall be satisfied, all other just claims shall be admitted to payment on an equal footing, without priority or preference, and in equal proportion; if there be not sufficient to discharge all such judgments and decrees, a proportionable
dividend shall be made among the judgment and decree creditors aforesaid. In no case shall an executor or administrator aforesaid, be allowed
to retain for his own claim against the deceased, unless the same be passed by the orphans' court, and when passed it shall stand on an equal footing with other claims of like nature; and it shall be the duty of
every executor or administrator aforesaid to give in a claim against himself, and no executor or administrator shall discharge any claim against the deceased, otherwise than at his own risk, unless the same shall be first passed by the orphans' court granting the administration.
Sec . 11. And be it further enacted, That it shall be lawful for any person or persons to whom letters testamentary or of administration hath been or may hereafter be granted by the proper authority in any of the United States or the territories thereof, to maintain any suit or action and to prosecute and recover any claim in the district of Columbia, in the same manner as if the letters testamentary or of administration had been granted to such person or persons by the proper authority in the
said district; and the letters testamentary or of administration, or a copy thereof, certified under the seal of the authority granting the same,
shall be sufficient evidence to prove the granting thereof, and that the person or persons, as the case may be, hath or have administration.
Sec . 12. And be it further enacted, That instead of the sessions as heretofore by law directed, the courts for the county of Alexandria shall, after this act goes into operation, commence on the third Monday in April, and on the fourth Monday in November in every year; and all cases, motions, process, causes, matters and things pending in or returnable to the sessions as heretofore fixed by law, shall be continued and returned respectively to the sessions of the said court hereby appointed to be holden.
Sec . 13. And be it further enacted, That it shall be the duty of the constables of the county of Washington in the district of Columbia, upon a capias ad satisfaciendum issuing out of the clerk's office of the said

Maryland law of 1796 is, therefore, in force in the county of Washington ; and the petitioners, if brought directly from the state of Virginia into the county of Washington, would, under the provisions of that law, be entitled to their freedom. By the act of Congress of the 24th of June, 1812, it was declared, " that hereafter it shall be lawful for any inhabitant or inhabitants, in either of the said counties, (Washington and Alexandria,) owning and possessing any slave or slaves therein, to remove the same from one county into the other, and to exercise, freely and fully, all the rights of property, in and over the said slave or slaves therein, which would be exercised over him, her, or them, in the county from whence the removal was made." Ibid.
The court erred in refusing to give the fourth instruction prayed on the part of the petitioner, which asked that it should be submitted to the jury whether, from the evidence, the bringing of the petitioners from Virginia to Alexandria, and the hiring them there, was not merely colourable, with intent to evade the law. Ibid.
A wife having separated herself from her husband, for ill-treatment by him, applied to the county court of Prince George, Maryland, for alimony, which was allowed to her, pendente lite. The husband gave the wife a female negro slave, and some other property, in discharge of the alimony. She removed to Washington, hired out the slave, and afterwards, in consideration of a sum of money, and for other considerations, she manumitted, by deed, the slave, and her two infant children, the eldest not three years old. Some time after the arrangement between the husband and wife, a final separation took place between them, by a verbal agreement; each to retain "the property each had, and to be quits for ever," and the wife relinquished all further claim for alimony. After the death of the wife, the husband claimed the female and her children as his slaves. Held, that they were free by virtue of the deed of manumission executed by the wife. Wallingsford v. Allen, 10 Peters, 583.

Sec . 14. And be it further enacted, That the said marshal shall be entitled to the same fee for commitment and releasement of said debtor

Sec . 5. And be it further enacted, That all vessels, goods and effects, the property of any citizen of the United States, or of persons resident within and under the protection of the United States, or of persons per-
manently resident within and under the protection of any foreign prince, government or state, in amity with the United States, which shall have
been captured by the enemy and which shall be recaptured by vessels commissioned as aforesaid, shall be restored to the lawful owners, upon payment by them respectively, of a just and reasonable salvage, to be
determined by the mutual agreement of the parties concerned, or by the decree of any court having competent jurisdiction, according to the nature of each case, agreeably to the provisions heretofore established by law. And such salvage shall be distributed among the owners, officers and crews of the vessels commissioned as aforesaid, and making such recaptures according to any written agreement which shall be between them; and in case of no such agreement, then in the same manner and upon the principles herein before provided in case of cap-
ture.(b)

(a) The prize act of June 26th, 1812, chap. 107, operates as a grant from the United States to the captors, of all property rightfully captured by commissioned privateers, as prize of war. The Sally, 8 Cranch, 382; 3 Cond. Rep. 177.
Prize money must be distributed according to some written agreement of the parties, otherwise it is distributable according to the 4th sec. of the prize act of the 26th of June, 1812, chap. 107. A parol agreement as to distribution is void. The Dash, 1 Mason's C. C. R. 4.
If the shipping articles omit to state the shares, to which some of the officers and crew are entitled, they are still entitled to claim their shares under the prize act. Ibid.
A parol assignment of a share in prizes is void. Ibid. All captures, made by non-commissioned captors, are made for the government: and since the provisions in the prize acts as to the distribution of prize proceeds, are confined to public and private armed vessels, cruising under regular commissions; the only claim which can be sustained by such non-commissioned captors must be in the nature of salvage, for bringing in and preserving the property. The Dos Hermanos, 10 Wheat. 306 ; 6 Cond. Rep. 109. The commander of a squadron, to whose command a ship of war is attached, and under whose orders she sails, is entitled to the flag-twentieth of all prizes made by such ship, although the other part of the squadron may never have sailed on the cruise, in consequence of a blockade by a superior force. Decatur v. Chew, 1 Gallis. C. C. R. 506. To deprive such commander of his flag-twentieth, on account of his having left his station, under the sixth section of the act of April 23d, 1800, chap. 33, it is indispensable that some local station should have been assigned him. Ibid. Where no grant is made, all captures made under the authority of the executive, inure to the use of the government. The Emulous, 1 Gallis. C. C. R. 563. As between public ships, the rule for the distribution of prizes is settled by the seventh article of the sixth section in the act of April 23d, 1800, chap. 33, which provides that, in cases of joint capture, the capturing ships shall share " according to the number of men and guns on board each ship in sight." The
Despatch, 2 Gallis. C. C. R. 1. As to privateers, no statute regulation exists, and therefore their claims are settled by the general law
of relative strength, which is to be measured by the number of men on board each ship. Ibid. (b) Salvage in Prize Causes.--On a recapture of a vessel by a neutral vessel, no claim for salvage can
arise, for the recapture was a hostile act, not justified by the situation of the nation to which the recapturing vessel belongs, in relation to that from the possession of which the vessel recaptured was taken. The degree of service rendered in such a case, is precisely the same as if it had been rendered by a belligerent; yet, the rights accruing from the recapture are different, because no right can accrue from an act which was unlawful. Talbot v. Seeinan, 1 Cranch, 1; 1 Cond. Rep. 229.
When a belligerent permits her cruisers to capture neutral vessels, and carry them in for adjudication, and thus subjects such vessels to perils, almost equal to those of absolute capture, salvage for a recapture of such a neutral vessel will be allowed. Ibid.
American property recaptured, was restored on payment of salvage ; the libel having prayed a condemnation as prize, and no salvage having been claimed. The question of salvage is incident to the question of prize. The Adeline, 9 Cranch, 244; 3 Cond. Rep. 397.
A merchant ship, the property of subjects of the king of Great Britain, was captured on the high seas by a French squadron, a prize master and crew put on board of her, and she remained in company with the captors upwards of twenty-four hours, when she was loft by the prize master and the crew; frequent

Sec . 6. And be it further enacted, That before breaking bulk of any vessel which shall be captured as aforesaid, or other disposal or conversion thereof, or of any articles which shall be found on board the same, such captured vessel, goods or effects, shall be brought into some port of the United States, or into some port of a nation in amity with the United States, and shall be proceeded against, before a competent tribunal ; and after condemnation and forfeiture thereof, shall belong to the owners and captors thereof, and be distributed as aforesaid : and in
the case of all captured vessels, goods and effects which shall be brought within the jurisdiction of the United States, the district courts of the
United States shall have exclusive original cognizance thereof, as in civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction ; and the said courts, or the courts, being courts of the United States, into which such cases shall be removed, and in which they shall be finally decided, shall and may decree restitution, in whole or in part, when the capture shall have been made without just cause. And if made without probable cause, or otherwise unreasonably, may order and decree damages and costs to the party injured, and for which the owners and commanders of the vessels making such captures, and also the vessels, shall be liable.
Sec . 7. And be it further enacted, That all prisoners found on board any captured vessels, or on board any recaptured vessel, shall be reported to the collector of the port in the United States in which they shall first arrive, and shall be delivered into the custody of the marshal of the district or some civil or military officer of the United States, or of any state in or near such port, who shall take charge of their safe keeping and support, at the expense of the United States.
Sec . 8. And be it further enacted, That the President of the United States shall be, and he is hereby authorized to establish and order suitable instructions for the better governing and directing the conduct of the vessels, so commissioned, their officers and crews, copies of which
shall be delivered, by the collector of the customs,.to the commanders when they shall give bond as aforesaid.
Sec . 9. And be it further enacted, That a bounty shall be paid by the United States of twenty dollars for each person on board any armed ship or vessel, belonging to the enemy, at the commencement of an engagement, which shall be burnt, sunk or destroyed, by any vessel commissioned as aforesaid, which shall be of equal or inferior force, the same to be divided as in other cases of prize money.

She was found deserted and abandoned, by an American vessel, bound on a European voyage, and by the mate and part of the crew brought into Boston. A claim was made to her by the British consul for the original owners, and by the French consul for the captors. Salvage, amounting to one third of the gross proceeds of the sales of the ship and cargo, were decreed to the owners, masters and crew of the American ship; and the residue of the proceeds were ordered to be paid to the French republic, or those concerned in the capture. M'Donough v. Danery, and the Ship Mary Ford, 3 Dall. 188; 1 Cond. Rep. 94.
One half of the whole value of an American vessel and cargo, recaptured by a vessel of war of the United States, after she had been captured by a French privateer, on the 31st of March, 1799, was allowed as salvage. Bas, Plaintiff in Error v. Tingy, 4 Dall. 37 ; 1 Cond. Rep. 221.
An American vessel was captured by the enemy, and after condemnation and sale to a subject of the enemy, was recaptured by an American privateer. Held, that the original owner was not entitled to restitution on payment of salvage, under the salvage act of the 3d of March, 1800, chap. 14, and the prize act of 26th June, 1812, chap. 107. The Star, 3 Wheat. 78; 4 Cond. Rep. 198.
In order to entitle to salvage, as upon a recapture or rescue, the property must have been in the possession, either actual or constructive, of the enemy. The Ann Green, 1 Gallis. C. C. R. 274, 289.
Salvage allowed upon a recapture of a ransomed ship, the ransom bill declaring that the sum agreed upon therein, should be payable only upon the arrival of the vessel at her port of destination, which she never reached. The Harriet, Bee's D. C. R. 128.
In case of a recapture by a public vessel of war, the salvage can be ascertained only by a sale of the property, unless both parties consent to an appraisement. The Dolphin, Bee's D. C. R. 152,
Salvage is not due for rescuing the vessel of a neutral out of the hands of a belligerent, who has taken possession for a supposed violation of a treaty or of the law of nations. The Antelope, Bee's D. C. R.

Cha p. CXXIX.--An Act to prohibit American vessels from proceeding to or
trading with the enemies of the United States, and for other purposes.(a)

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That no ship or vessel, owned

(a) The decisions of the Courts of the United States, on " Trading with the Enemy," have been :-- Action of assumpsit to recover the balance of an account current for merchandise purchased in England by order of the defendants. The defence was, that the contract was made during the war, and therefore void. By the Court--The doctrine is not to be questioned at this day, that, during a state of hostility, lhe citizens of the hostile states are incapable of contracting with each other. Scholefield v. Eichelberger, 7 Peters, 586. To say that this rule is without exception, would be assuming too great latitude. The question has never yet been examined whether a contract for necessaries, or even for money to enable the individual to get home, could not be enforced; and analogies familiar to the law, as well as the influence of the general rule, in international law, that the severities of war are to be diminished by all safe and practical means, might be appealed to in support of such an exception. But at present, it may be safely affirmed that there is no recognized exception, but permission of a state to its own citizens; which is also implied in any treaty stipulation to that effect, entered into with a belligerent. Ibid. Property engaged in illicit trade with the enemy, must be condemned to the captors, not to the United States. The Sally, Porter, Master, 8 Cranch, 382; 3 Cond. Rep. 177. A vessel owned by citizens of the United States, sailed from Naples in the year 1812, for the United States, with a cargo, and a British license to carry the same to England. On her passage, hearing of the war, she altered her course for England, was captured by the British, carried into Ireland, libelled and acquitted, sold her cargo, and after a detention of seven months in Ireland, purchased a return cargo in England, sailed for the United States, and was captured by an American privateer. The vessel and cargo were condemned as prize to the captors. The Alexander, 8 Cranch, 169 ; 3 Cond. Rep. 72. If a citizen of the United States establishes his domicil in a foreign country, between which and the United States hostilities afterwards break out, any property shipped by him before knowledge of the war, and captured by an American cruiser after the declaration of war, will be condemned as prize. The Venus, 8 Cranch, 253; 3 Cond. Rep. 109. Illegal traffic stamps a hostile character on the property, and attaches to it all the penal consequences of enemy ownership. The Sally, 8 Cranch, 382; 3 Cond. Rep. 177. The property of a citizen does not become divested, ipso facto, by the mere act of illicit intercourse with the enemy; the property is only liable to be condemned as enemy's property, or as adhering to the enemy, if rightfully captured during the voyage. The Thomas Gibbons, 8 Cranch, 421 ; 3 Cond. Rep. 193. A vessel sailing to an enemy port, after knowledge of the war, and captured, bringing thence a cargo consisting chiefly of enemy goods, is liable to confiscation as prize of war. The St. Lawrence, 8 Cranch, 434; 3 Cond. Rep. 202. Trading with the enemy is not excused by the necessity of obtaining funds to pay the expenses of the ship; nor by the opinion of an American minister expressed to the master, that by undertaking the voyage he would violate no law of the United States. The Joseph, 8 Cranch, 451 ; 3 Cond. Rep. 212. If, upon the breaking out of a war, a citizen has a right to withdraw his property from the enemy's country, it is necessary it should be exercised with due diligence, and within a reasonable time after the knowledge of hostilities. The St. Lawrence, 9 Cranch, 120; 3 Cond. Rep. 301. If a cargo be innocently put on board in an enemy's country, if at that time the importation be lawful, it cannot be rendered unlawful by a detention, occasioned in the course of the voyage, either by the perils of the sea or the act of the enemy ; unless this effect be produced by some positive act of the legislature. The Mary, 9 Cranch, 126 ; 3 Cond. Rep. 306. An American citizen is equally guilty of trading with the enemy, whether that trade is carried on between a hostile port and the United States, or between such port and any foreign nation. The Rugen, 1 Wheat. 62 ; 3 Cond. Rep. 485. The offence of trading with the enemy is complete, the moment a vessel sails with intention to carry her cargo to a hostile port. Ibid. A subject of a state at war cannot, under cover of neutral muniments, however regularly procured, or formal, violate with impunity his duty and allegiance to his own country. Ibid. All trade with the enemy, unless with the permission of the sovereign, is interdicted ; and subjects the property engaged in it to the penalty of confiscation. The Rapid, 1 Gallis. C. C. R. 295. All communication and intercourse with the enemy is prohibited, and it is in nowise important, whether the property engaged in the inimical communication be bought and sold, or merely transported and shipped. Ibid. A citizen of the United States cannot lawfully withdraw his property, acquired before the war, from the enemy's country, after he has knowledge of the war, without permission of government. The St. Lawrence, 1 Gallis. C. C. R. 467. If a vessel be sent from the United States, after knowledge of the war, to the enemy's country to withdraw such property, the vessel and cargo are subject to capture and condemnation, jure belli. 1 Gallis. C. C. R. 295. The property of citizens taken trading with the enemy, is considered as quasi enemy's property.
Ibid. A trade to a neutral port, during war, is not rendered illegal from the mere circumstance that the
interests of the enemy are thereby aided, or his policy enforced : it must, before it can be liable to condemnation on that ground, be carried on, on account of the enemy, under contract with him, destined for his use, or voluntarily incorporated into his service by licenses. The Liverpool Packet, 1 Gallis. C. C. R. 513.
The circumstance that a neutral is engaged in enemy navigation does not subject all his trade from the neutral country, on neutral voyages, to the enemy character. Ibid.

in whole or in part by a citizen or citizens of the United States, shall be permitted to clear out or depart from any port or place within the limits of the United States or territories thereof, to any foreign port or place, till the owner or owners, agent, factor, freighter, master or commander, shall have given bond, with sufficient security, in the amount of such ship or vessel and cargo, not to proceed to or trade with the enemies of the United States. And if any ship or vessel owned as aforesaid, shall depart from any port or place within the limits of the United States or territories thereof, for any foreign port or place without giving bond with security aforesaid, such ship or vessel, and cargo, shall be forfeited to the use of the United States; and the owner or owners, freighter, factor or agent, master or commander, shall severally forfeit and pay a sum equal to the value of such ship or vessel and cargo; and the said master or commander, if privy thereto, and being thereof convicted, shall be liable to a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars, and imprisoned for a term not exceeding twelve months, in the discretion of the court.
Sec . 2. And be it further enacted, That if any citizen or citizens of the United States, or person inhabiting the same, shall transport or attempt to transport, over land or otherwise, in any wagon, cart, sleigh, boat, or otherwise, naval or military stores, arms or the munitions of war, or any article of provision, from any place of the United States, to any place in Upper or Lower Canada, Nova Scotia or New Brunswick, the wagon, cart, sleigh, boat, or the thing by which the said naval or military stores, arms, or munitions of war or articles of provision are transported or attempted to be transported, together with such naval or

Owners of vessels to give bonds, upon clearing out, not to trade with the enemy.
Penalty for so doing.
Trade with the enemy by land interdicted.

Every voyage from an enemy port, especially with a cargo on board, and without the license of the government, carries with it a presumption of illegal traffic and hostile interests, from which nothing but the most explicit proofs by the claimants can relieve the cause. The presumption of illegal traffic arises, notwithstanding any papers or any explanation of the persons found on board: the captors have a right to bring the property in, and subject the whole to the adjudication of a competent tribunal. In such case, damagesand costs are never to be adjudged as against the captors. Ibid.
If, after a knowledge of the war, an American vessel go to an enemy port, and take in a cargo there, the vessel and cargo are liable to confiscation for trading with the enemy. The Alexander, 1 Gallis. C. C. R. 532.

If an American vessel, after knowledge of the war, proceed from a neutral to a hostile port on freight, it is a trading with the enemy, which subjects the vessel to forfeiture; and she is liable therefore on her return voyage to the United States. The Joseph, 1 Gallis. C. C. R. 545.
In cases of trading With the enemy, the property is deemed quasi enemy's property, and it is condemned to the captors and not to the United States. Ibid.
No principle of national or municipal law is better settled than that all contracts with an enemy, made during war, are utterly void. The Emulous, 1 Gallis. C. C. R. 563.
A shipment made from the enemy's country, after a knowledge of the war, by an American citizen, subjects the property to condemnation as prize of war. The Mary, 1 Gallis. C. C. R. 620.
A shipment made, after a known war, by an American citizen, subjects the property to condemnation as prize of war. The Diana, 2 Gallis. C. C. R. 93.
If an American vessel take on board a cargo from an enemy's ship, under the pretence that it is ransomed, it is an illegal traffic, for which, by the law of war, she is liable to condemnation as prize of war; and may be seized on the return voyage. The Lord Wellington, 2 Gallis. C. C. R. 103.
A citizen of the United States may lawfully draw a bill on a subject of a foreign power, with whom we are at war; such an act not leading to any injurious intercourse, nor amounting to a trading with the enemy. United States v. Barker, Paine's C. C. R. 156.
An American vessel, after the commencement of hostilities with Great Britain, sailed,having on board a messenger from the British minister in the United States, with despatches for his government, and a letter of protection from British capture ; this is a sufficient cause of condemnation. The Tulip, 3 Wash. C. C. R. 181.

All contracts with an enemy are not necessarily void. Cases of extreme necessity, form exceptions

to the rule. Contracts made under license of the government, whether they arise directly or collaterally,

out of the licensed trade; or if the enemy, with whom the contract is made, be in the hostile country,

by license of that government, (cases of ransom bonds,) so contracts made by prisoners of war, for their

subsistence, are also exceptions. The William Penn, 3 Wash. C. C. R. 484.

A voyage from an enemy port with a cargo on board, without the license of the government, is of

itself a probable cause for capture. The Liverpool Packet, 1 Gallis. C. C. R. 513.

A trade to a neutral port is not illegal, although the public enemy derive benefit thereby, unless such

trade be considered in connexion with, or subservient to, hostile interests and policy. Ibid.

The United States may proceed against property found engaged in trade with the enemy, as prize of

war. The Eliza, 2 Gallis. C. C. R. 4.

At common law, any individual might seize for the king; and upon this ground it has been held, that public or private armed ships may seize for violation of a statute. But, in such case, it is at the peril of the party making the seizure. The Rover, 2 Gallis. C. C. R. 240.
