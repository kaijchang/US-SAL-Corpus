The memorial of Doctor Joseph Merideth Toner, of the City of Washington, in the District of Columbia, respectfully shows to your honorable bodies, that he is the owner of a large and valuable collection of books and pamphlets, about twenty thousand volumes or upwards in number, treating of medical, scientific, historical, biographical, literary, and miscellaneous subjects, and many of which are very rare and of great interest ; and desiring that said collection of books, to the accumulation of which your memorialist has devoted considerable funds and a large part of his life, should be permanently preserved and placed where it would be most beneficial to the cause of science and most
advantageous to the public, he respectfully offers the said collection to the United States of America, to be placed in the National Library of the United States at the city of Washington, under the management and control of the Librarian of Congress, upon the terms and conditions following, which he deems to be reasonable and just, and which he trusts will prove acceptable to your honorable bodies ; namely :
First. That the collection should be kept separate and apart from the other books and pamphlets in the Library, in separate rooms or alcoves, and that it should be known and distinguished as "The Toner Collection ."
Second. That the collection of books and pamphlets be bound, when requiring it, in a uniform and substantial manner, and have placed upon the back of each a parchment band to distinguish them , and that a device distinctive of the donation be stamped upon the title page of each, and that they be kept accessible for reference, and be catalogued as speedily as practicable, and when they appear by title in the printed catalogue of the Library that some letter or symbol indicative of the collection be used , and that the condition and growth of the collection be made a matter of record in each annual report by the Librarian of Congress .
Third, That the collection be kept and used mainly for reference, and be consulted subject to the rules governing the use of rare books, and be called upon for service only when no other copy of a book or pamphlet asked for is available, and not be taken out of the Library except for special reasons.
Fourth, That your memorialist should be permitted to make additions to the collection from time to time as he may desire, upon the same
terms as herein specified ; and that he have liberty to insure the perpetual increase and improvement of the collection by the establishment of a trust-fund for the purpose.
Your memorialist, while desiring to perpetuate his name in connection with the donation which he here proposes to make, believes that the "Toner Collection " will prove useful and valuable to the country, and will involve no unusual expense upon the part of the United States.
Respectfully Submitted, J. M TONER.

duly appointed and commissioned a paymaster in the Navy of the United States from the twentieth day of February, anno Domini eighteen hundred and sixty-six ; and

Whereas, on the twenty eighth day of January, anno Domini eighteen hundred and sixty - nine, the Secretary of the Navy issued an order declaring that said Bellows was dismissed the Naval service, declared in such order of dismissal to be "in consequence of the facts appearing

upon the record of the naval court martial before which he was tried, in November, eighteen hundred and sixty- eight ; " and
Whereas, on the twenty-second day of January, anno Domini eighteen hundred and eighty, the President of the United States, through the Secretary of the Navy, after investigation of the facts in the case, determined and issued an order declaring that said order of dismissal was illegal and void, and annulled and revoked, because issued contrary to the provisions of section sixteen hundred and twenty-four, article thirtysix, page two hundred and eighty-two of the Revised Statutes of the United States, and the name of said Edward Bellows was thereupon, by order of the President, restored to the list of Paymasters on the Naval Register, next after that of Paymaster George A. Lyon, being the original relative position held by him on that list, and to which he is entitled by virtue of his commission, which position on said list the said Bellows has ever since held and now holds, and

Whereas, on the sixteenth day of March, anno Domini eighteen hundred and sixty-nine, while the said order of dismissal remained upon the records unrevoked , the President of the United States, under the mistaken belief that said order of dismissal was valid and according to law, and that the same caused a vacancy, by reason of said dismissal, in the list of paymasters, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate appointed Leonard A. Frailey paymaster in the Navy, de-

claring such appointment to be " vice Bellows, dismissed ; " and Whereas, by a recent decision and judgment of the Supreme Court
of the United States in the case of Charles M. Blake versus the United

States (thirteenth Otto, page two hundred and twenty-seven) said de-
cision makes questionable the right of said Bellows to hold said office ; and

Whereas, including the said Bellows, the present number of paymas-

ters does not exceed the number now allowed by law: Therefore

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United

States

of America

That the President

during the time his name was not borne on said list, and during which
he was not recognized as a paymaster in the service; Provided further, That after such appointment the said Edward Bellows shall be entitled
to longevity pay upon his said commission of date February twentieth, eighteen hundred and sixty-six.

CONVENTION- INTERNATIONAL. AUG. 22, 1864.

ART. X. Any merchantman, to whatever nation she may belong, charged ex clusively with removal of sick and wound-
ed, is protected byneutrality, but the mere fact, noted on the ship's books, of the vessel having been visited by an enemy's cruiser, renders the sick and wounded in-
capable of serving during the continuance of the war. The cruiser shall even have the right of putting on board an officer
in or ler to accompany the convoy, and thus verify the good faith of the operation.
If the merchant ship also carries a cargo, her neutrality will still protect it, provided that such cargo is not of a nature to be confiscated by the belligerents.
The belligerents retain the right to interdict neutralized vessels from all commu-
nication, and from any course which they
may deem prejudicial to the secrecy of their operations. In urgent cases special conventions may be entered into between commanders-in-chief, in order to neutralize temporarily and in a special manner the vessels intended for the removal ofthe sick and wounded.
ART. XI. Wounded or sick sailors and
soldiers, when embarked, to whatever nation they may belong, shall be protected and taken care of by their captors.
Their return to their own country is subject to the provisions of Article VI. of the Convention, and of the additional Article V.
ART. XII. The distinctive flag to be used with the national flag, in order to indicate any vessel or boat which may claim the benefits of neutrality, in virtue of the principles of this Convention, is a white
flag with a red cross. The belligerents may exercise in this respect any mode of verification which they may deem necessary .
Military hospital ships shall be distinguished by being painted white outside, with green strake.
ART. XIII. The hospital ships whichare equipped at the expense of the aid societies, recognized by the governments signing this Convention, and which are furnished with a commission emanating from the sovereign, who shall have given express authority for their being fitted out, and with a certificate from the proper
naval authority that they have been placed under his control during their fitting out and on their final departure, and that they were then appropriated solely to the purpose of their mission, shall be considered neutral, as well as the whole of their staff. They shall be recognized and protected by the belligerents.
They shall make themselves known by hoisting, together with theirnational flag, the white flag with a red cross. The distinctive mark of their staff, while per-

It has long been the pious custom of our people, with the closing of the year, to look back upon the blessings brought to them in the chang

ing course of the seasons, and to return solemn thanks to the All-giving Source from Whom they flow. And although at this period, when the

falling leaf admonishes us that the time of our sacred duty is at hand,

our Nation still lies in the shadow of a great bereavement, and the mourn

ing which has filled our hearts still finds its sorrowful expression toward

the God before Whom we but lately bowed in grief and supplication,

yet the countless benefits which have showered upon us during the past

twelvemonth call for our fervent gratitude and make it fitting that we

should rejoice with thankfulness that the Lord, in His infinite mercy

has most signally favored our country and our people. Peace without

and prosperity within have been vouchsafed to us, no pestilence has visited our shores, the abundant privileges of freedom which our fathers

left us in their wisdom are still our increasing heritage, and if, in parts of our vast domain , sore affliction has visited our brethren in their forest

homes, yet even this calamity has been tempered and in a manner sanetified by the generous compassion for the sufferers which has been called

forth throughout our land. For all these things, it is meet that the

voice of the Nation should go up to God in devout homage.
Appointment of Wherefore I , Chester A. Arthur, President of the United States, do
November 24 , 1881 , recommend that all the people observe Thursday, the twenty-fourth day
as a day of thanks- of November instant, as a day of National Thanksgiving and Prayer, giving.
by ceasing so far as may be from their secular labors, and meeting in

their several places of worship, there to join in ascribing honor and praise to Almighty God, whose goodness has been so manifest in our

history and in our lives, and offering earnest prayers that His bounties may continue to us and to our children.

In witness whereof I have hereunto set my band, and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.

Done at the city of Washington this fourth day of November in the

year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and eighty-one, and of

the Independence of the United States the one hundred & sixth.

A PROCLAMATION.

Whereas it is provided in the laws of the United States that " when Preamble.

ever, by reason of unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages of persons, or rebellion against the authority of the Government of the

United States, it shall become impracticable, in the judgment of the

President, to enforce, by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings,

the laws of the United States within any State or Territory, it shall be lawful for the President to call forth the militia of any or all the States, and to employ such parts of the land and naval forces of the United States as he may deem necessary to enforce the faithful execution of

the laws ofthe United States, or to suppress such rebellion, in whatever

State or Territory thereof the laws of the United States may be forcibly opposed or the execution thereof forcibly obstructed ; "
And whereas it has been made to appear satisfactorily to me, by information received from the Governor of the Territory of Arizona, and from the General of the Army of the United States, and other reliable sources, that in consequence of unlawful combinations of evil disposed MI persons who are banded together to oppose and obstruct the execution ofthe laws, it has become impracticable to enforce, by the ordinary course profjudicial proceedings, the laws ofthe United States within that Territory, and that the laws of the United States have been therein forcibly opposed and the execution thereof forcibly resisted ;
And whereas the laws of the United States require that whenever it

may be necessary, in the judgment of the President, to use the military forces for the purpose of enforcing the faithful execution of the laws

Fal 10

of the United States, he shall forthwith, by proclamation, command such insurgents to disperse and retire peaceably to their respective abodes, within a limited time :

Now, therefore, I, Chester A. Arthur, President of the United States, sonWsatronidensgisatllfpreormdo hereby admonish all good citizens of the United States, and es- violence in Ari-

pecially of the Territory of Arizona, against aiding, countenancing, zona.

abetting, or taking part in any such unlawful proceedings, and I do hereby warn all persons engaged in or connected with said obstruction

of the laws, to disperse and retire peaceably to their respective abodes

on or before noon of the fifteenth day of May.

In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.

The blessings demanding our gratitude are numerous and varied.

For the peace and amity which subsist between this Republic and all

the nations of the world ; for the freedom from internal discord and

violence ; for the increasing friendship between the different sections of

the land ; for liberty, justice and constitutional government ; for the

devotion of the people to our free institutions and their cheerful obedi

ence to mild laws ; for the constantly increasing strength of the Re-

public while extending its privileges to fellow men who come to us ; for

the improved means of internal communication, and the increased

facilities of intercourse with other Nations ; for the general prevailing

health of the year; for the prosperity of all our industries, the liberal

return for the mechanic's toil affording a market for the abundant har-

vests of the husbandman ; for the preservation of the national faith

and credit; for wise and generous provision to effect the intellectual

and moral education of our youth ; for the influence upon the conscience

of a restraining and transforming religion ; and for the joys of home ;

for these, and for many other blessings, we should give thanks. Day of National Wherefore, I do recommend that the day above designated be ob
