(a) Notes of the acts which have been passed relating to the assessment of lands for direct taxes.
Vol. i. page 580. Decisions of the courts of the United States, on the acts of Congress laying direct taxes on lands, &c. A collector selling land for taxes, must act in conformity with the law from which his power is de-
rived, and the purchaser is bound to inquire whether he has so acted. It is incumbent on the vendor to prove his power to sell. Stead's Executors v. Course, 4 Cranch, 403 ; 2 Cond. Rep. 151.
Under the act of Congress to lay and collect a direct tax, (July 14, 1798,) before the collector could sell the land of an unknown proprietor for non-payment of this tax, it was necessary that he should advertise the copy of the list of lands, &c. and the statement of the amount due for the tax and the notification to pay in sixty days, in four gazettes of the state, if there were so many. Parker v. Rule's lessee,
9 Cranch, 64 ; 3 Cond. Rep. 271. In the ease of a naked power not coupled with an interest, every pre-requisite to the exercise of
that power, should precede it. In the case of lands sold for the non-payment of taxes, the marshal's deed is not prima facie evidence that the pre-requisites of the law have been complied with; but the party claiming under it must show positively that the law has been complied with.

rived, and the purchaser is bound to inquire whether he has so acted. It is incumbent on the vendor to prove his power to sell. Stead's Executors v. Course, 4 Cranch, 403 ; 2 Cond. Rep. 151.
Under the act of Congress to lay and collect a direct tax, (July 14, 1798,) before the collector could sell the land of an unknown proprietor for non-payment of this tax, it was necessary that he should advertise the copy of the list of lands, &c. and the statement of the amount due for the tax and the notification to pay in sixty days, in four gazettes of the state, if there were so many.

that power, should precede it. In the case of lands sold for the non-payment of taxes, the marshal's deed is not prima facie evidence that the pre-requisites of the law have been complied with; but the party claiming under it must show positively that the law has been complied with.

And it shall be further lawful for the Secretary of the Treasury to direct all errors committed in the assessment, valuation, and tax lists, or in collection thereof, heretofore or hereafter made in the valuation, assessment, and tax lists of the direct tax, laid by virtue of the said act of Congress entitled " An act to lay and collect a direct tax within the United States," and also, all such errors as may from time to time be committed in the assessment, valuation, and tax lists, or in the collection thereof, as may hereafter be made in the assessment of the direct tax by this act laid, to be corrected in such form, and upon such evidence, as the said secre-

And the principal assessors, after hearing such appeals, shall proceed to make out and to deliver revised lists of their valuations and assessments, respectively, to the board of principal assessors, to be constituted as is hereinafter mentioned.

Art . 2. It is distinctly understood between the contracting parties, that no tribute, either as biennial presents, or under any other form or name whatever, shall ever be required by the Dey and Regency of Algiers from the United States of America, on any pretext whatever.

And it is agreed between the contracting parties, that, in lieu of the above, the Dey of Algiers shall cause to be delivered forthwith into the hands of the American Consul residing at Algiers, the whole of a quantity of bales of cotton left by the late Consul General of the United States in the public magazines in Algiers; and that he shall pay into the hands of the said Consul the sum of ten thousand Spanish dollars.

All vessels of war belonging to the United States of America, on meeting a cruiser belonging to the Regency of Algiers, on having seen her passports and certificates from the Consul of the United States residing in Algiers, shall permit her to proceed on her cruise unmolested, and without detention. No passport shall be granted by either party to any vessels, but such as are absolutely the property of citizens or subjects of the said contracting parties, on any pretence whatever.
Art . 8. A citizen or subject of either of the contracting parties having bought a prize vessel condemned by the other party, or by any other nation, the certificates of condemnation and bill of sale shall be a sufficient passport for such vessel for six months; which, considering the distance between the two countries, is no more than a reasonable time for her to procure proper passports.

Art . 15. As the government of the United States of America has, in itself, no character of enmity against the laws, religion, or tranquillity, of any nation, and as the said states have never entered into any voluntary war, or act of hostility, except in defence of their just rights on the high seas, it is declared, by the contracting parties, that no pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two nations; and the Consuls and Agents of both nations shall have liberty to celebrate the rites of their respective religions in their own houses.
The Consuls, respectively, shall have liberty and personal security given them to travel within the territories of each other, both by land and sea, and shall not be prevented from going on board any vessels they may think proper to visit; they shall likewise have liberty to appoint their own drogoman and broker.
Art . 16. In case of any dispute arising from the violation of any of the articles of this treaty, no appeal shall be made to arms, nor shall war be declared on any pretext whatever; but if the Consul residing at the place where the dispute shall happen shall not be able to settle the same, the government of that country shall state their grievance in writing and transmit the same to the government of the other, and the period of three months shall be allowed for answers to be returned, during which time no act of hostility shall be permitted by either party ; and in case the grievances are not redressed, and a war should be the event, the Consuls, and citizens, and subjects, of both parties, respectively, shall be permitted to embark with their effects unmolested, on board of what vessel or vessels they shall think proper, reasonable time being allowed for that purpose.

Ar t . 18. If any of the Barbary States, or other powers at war with the United States, shall capture any American vessel and send her into any port of the Regency of Algiers, they shall not be permitted to sell her, but shall be forced to depart the port on procuring the requisite

227

supplies of provisions; but the vessels of war of the United States, with any prizes they may capture from their enemies, shall have liberty to frequent the ports of Algiers for refreshments of any kind, and to sell

such disputes shall be settled by the Consuls or Agents of the respective
nations; and any disputes or suits at law that may take place between any citizens of the United States and the subjects of the Regency of
Algiers, shall be decided by the Dey in person, and no other.

Consul of U.S. to decide disputes between American citizens, &c.

Art . 20. If a citizen of the United States should kill, wound, or strike, a subject of Algiers, or, on the contrary, a subject of Algiers should kill, wound, or strike, a citizen of the United States, the law of the country shall take place, and equal justice shall be rendered, the Consul assisting at the trial; but the sentence of punishment against an American citizen shall not be greater or more severe than it would be against a Turk in the same predicament; and if any delinquent should make his escape, the Consul shall not be responsible for him in any manner whatever.
Art . 21. The Consul of the United States of America shall not be required to pay any customs or duties whatever on any thing he imports from a foreign country for the use of his house and family.
Art . 22. Should any of the citizens of the United States of America die, within the limits of the Regency of Algiers, the Dey and his subjects shall not interfere with the property of the deceased, but it shall be under the immediate direction of the Consul, unless otherwise disposed of by will. Should there be no Consul, the effects shall be deposited in the hands of some person worthy of trust, until the party shall appear who has a right to demand them, when they shall render an account of the property; neither shall the Dey or his subjects give hindrance in the execution of any will that may appear.

DECLARATION.
The undersigned, his Britannick majesty's charge d'affaires in the United States of America, is commanded by his royal highness the Prince Regent, acting in the name and on the behalf of his majesty, to explain and declare, upon the exchange of the ratifications of the Convention concluded at London, on the third of July of the present year, for regulating the commerce and navigation between the two countries, that, in consequence of events which have happened in Europe subsequent to the signature of the Convention aforesaid, it has been deemed expedient, and determined, in conjunction with the allied sovereigns that St. Helena shall be the place allotted for the future residence of general Napoleon Bonaparte, under such regulations as may be necessary for the perfect security of his person, and it has been resolved, for that purpose, that all ships and vessels whatever, as well British ships and vessels as others, excepting only ships belonging to the East-India company, shall be excluded from all communication with, or approach
to, that Island. It has therefore become impossible to comply with so much of the
third article of the treaty as relates to the liberty of touching for refreshment at the Island of St. Helena, and the ratifications of the said treaty will be exchanged under the explicit declaration and understanding, that the vessels of the United States cannot be allowed to touch at, or hold any communication whatever with, the said Island, so long as the said Island shall continue to be the place of residence of the said
Napoleon Bonaparte.(a)

Declaration of 24th Nov. 1815.
All vessels, except those of the East India Company, exeluded from approaching the Island. Vessels of the U. S. must not touch at St. Helena.

March. 4, 1815. BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
»
A PROCLAMATION.

The second Thursday in
April next, appointed a day of public Thanks-
giving for peace.

The Senate and House of Representatives of the United States, have, by a joint resolution, signified their desire that a day may be recommended to be observed by the people of the United States with religious solemnity, as a day of thanksgiving, and Of devout acknowledgments to Almighty God for His great goodness manifested in restoring to them the blessing of peace.
No people ought to feel greater obligations to celebrate the goodness of the Great Disposer of events, and of the destiny of nations, than the people of the United States. His kind providence originally conducted them to one of the best portions of the dwelling-place allotted for the great family of the human race. He protected and cherished them, under all the difficulties and trials to which they were exposed in their early days. Under His fostering care, their habits, their sentiments, and their pursuits prepared them for a transition, in due time, to a state of independence and self-government. In the arduous struggle by which it was attained, they were distinguished by multiplied tokens of His benign interposition. During the interval which succeeded, He reared them into the strength and endowed them with the resources which have enabled them to assert their national rights, and to enhance their national character, in another arduous conflict, which is now so happily terminated by a peace and reconciliation with those who have been our enemies. And to the same Divine Author of every good and perfect gift, we are indebted for all those privileges and advantages, religious as well as civil, which are so richly enjoyed in this favored land.
It is for blessings such as these, and especially for the restoration of the blessing of peace, that I now recommend that the second Thursday in April next, be set apart as a day on which the people of every religious denomination, may, in their solemn assemblies, unite their hearts and their voices in a free will

Preamble.
Arrangement as to naval forces on the Lakes
Assent of Senate.

Whe re as an arrangement was entered into at the city of Washington, in the month of April, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and seventeen, between Richard Rush, Esquire, at that time acting as Secretary for the Department of State of the United States, for and in behalf of the government of the United States, and the Right Honorable Charles Bagot, his Britannic Majesty's Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary, for and in behalf of his Britannic Majesty, which arrangement is in the words following, to wit:--
" The naval force to be maintained upon the American Lakes by his majesty and the government of the United States shall henceforth be confined to the following vessels on each side, that is--
" On Lake Ontario, to one vessel not exceeding one hundred tons burden, and armed with two eighteen pound cannon
" On the Upper Lakes, to two vessels not exceeding like burden each, and armed with like force.
" On the waters of Lake Champlain, to one vessel not exceeding like burden, and armed with like force.
" All other armed vessels on these lakes shall be forthwith dismantled, and no other vessels of war shall be there built or armed.
" If either party should hereafter be desirous of annulling this stipulation, and should give notice to that effect to the other party, it shall cease to be binding after the expiration of six months from the date of such notice.
" The naval force so to be limited shall be restricted to such services as will, in no respect, interfere with the proper duties of the armed vessels of the other party."
And whereas the Senate of the United States have approved of the said arrangement, and recommended that it should be carried into effect, the same having also received the sanction of his royal highness the Prince Regent, acting in the name and on the behalf of his Britannic majesty.
Now, therefore, I, JAMES MONROE, President of the United States, do, by this my proclamation, make known and declare that the arrangement afore-

A PROCLAMATION.

The two houses of the National Legislature having, by a joint resolution expressed their desire that, in the present time of public calamity and war, a day may be recommended to be observed by the people of the United States as a day of public humiliation and fasting, and of prayer to. Almighty God for the safety and welfare of these States, his blessing on their arms and a speedy restoration of peace: I have deemed it proper, by this proclamation, to recommend that
Thursday the twelfth of January next be set apart as a day on which all may have an opportunity of voluntarily offering, at the same time, in their respective religious assemblies, their humble adoration to the great Sovereign of the Universe, of confessing their sins and transgressions, and of strengthening their vows of repentance and amendment. They will be invited by the same solemn occasion to call to mind the distinguished favors conferred on the American people, in the general health which has been enjoyed, in the abundant fruits of the season ; in the progress of the arts instrumental to their comfort, their prosperity, and their security; and in the victories which have so powerfully contributed to the defence and protection of our country; a devout thankfulness for all which ought to be mingled with their supplications to the Beneficent Parent of the human race, that He would be graciously pleased to pardon all their offences against Him; to support and animate them in the discharge of their respective duties; to continue to them the precious advantages flowing from political institutions, so auspicious to their safety against dangers from abroad, to their tranquillity at home, and to their liberties, civil and religious; and that He would, in a special manner, preside over the nation, in its public councils and constituted authorities, giving wisdom to its measures and success to its arms, in maintaining its rights, and in overcoming all hostile designs and attempts against it; and finally, that, by inspiring the enemy with dispositions favorable to a just and reasonable peace, its blessings may be speedily and happily restored.

No. 15. Pardon to certain Offenders off Louisiana.
BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
A PROCLAMATION. *
Amo ng the many evils produced by the wars which, with little intermission, have afflicted Europe, and extended their ravages into other quarters of the globe, for a period exceeding twenty years, the dispersion of a considerable portion of the inhabitants of different countries, in sorrow and in want, has not been the least injurious to human happiness, nor the least severe in the trial of human virtue.
It had long been ascertained that many foreigners, flying from the dangers of their own home, and that some citizens, forgetful of their duty, had co-operated, in forming an establishment on the island of Barrataria, near the mouth of the River Mississippi, for the purposes of a clandestine and lawless trade. The government of the United States caused the establishment to be broken up and destroyed ; and having obtained the means of designating the offenders of every description, it only remained to answer the demands of justice by inflicting an exemplary punishment.
But it has since been represented that the offenders have manifested a sincere penitence ; that they have abandoned the prosecution of the worse cause for the support of the best; and, particularly, that they have exhibited, in the defence of New Orleans, unequivocal traits of courage and fidelity. Offenders, who have refused to become the associates of the enemy in the war, upon the most seducing terms of invitation, and who have aided to repel his hostile invasion of the territory of the United States, can no longer be considered as objects of punishment, but. as objects of a generous forgiveness.

No. 16. Day of Public Thanksgiving appointedfor Peace.

March. 4, 1815. BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
»
A PROCLAMATION.

The second Thursday in
April next, appointed a day of public Thanks-
giving for peace.

The Senate and House of Representatives of the United States, have, by a joint resolution, signified their desire that a day may be recommended to be observed by the people of the United States with religious solemnity, as a day of thanksgiving, and Of devout acknowledgments to Almighty God for His great goodness manifested in restoring to them the blessing of peace.
No people ought to feel greater obligations to celebrate the goodness of the Great Disposer of events, and of the destiny of nations, than the people of the United States. His kind providence originally conducted them to one of the best portions of the dwelling-place allotted for the great family of the human race. He protected and cherished them, under all the difficulties and trials to which they were exposed in their early days. Under His fostering care, their habits, their sentiments, and their pursuits prepared them for a transition, in due time, to a state of independence and self-government. In the arduous struggle by which it was attained, they were distinguished by multiplied tokens of His benign interposition. During the interval which succeeded, He reared them into the strength and endowed them with the resources which have enabled them to assert their national rights, and to enhance their national character, in another arduous conflict, which is now so happily terminated by a peace and reconciliation with those who have been our enemies. And to the same Divine Author of every good and perfect gift, we are indebted for all those privileges and advantages, religious as well as civil, which are so richly enjoyed in this favored land.
It is for blessings such as these, and especially for the restoration of the blessing of peace, that I now recommend that the second Thursday in April next, be set apart as a day on which the people of every religious denomination, may, in their solemn assemblies, unite their hearts and their voices in a free will
