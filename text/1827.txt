BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,

A PROCLAMATION.

Whereas, by the sixth section of an Act of Congress, entitled " An act to regulate the commercial intercourse between the United States and certain British colonial ports," which was approved on the first day of March, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and twenty-three, it is enacted,
that this act, unless repealed, altered or amended, by Congress, shall be and continue in force so long as the above enumerated British colonial ports shall be open to the admission of the vessels of the United States, conformably to the provisions of the British act of Parliament, of the twenty-fourth of June last, being the forty-fourth chapter of the acts of the third year of George the Fourth: but if at any time the trade and intercourse between the United States and all or any of the above enumerated British colonial ports, authorized by the said act of Parliament, should be prohibited by a British order in Council, or by act of Parliament, then, from the day of the date of such order in Council, or act of Parliament, or from the time that the same shall commence to be in force, proclamation to that effect having been made by the President of the United States, each and every provision of this act, so far as the same shall apply to the intercourse between the United States and the above- enumerated British Colonial ports, in British vessels, shall cease to operate in their favour ; and each and every provision of the ` Act concerning navigation,' approved on the eighteenth of April, one thousand eight hundred and eighteen, and of the act supplementary thereto, approved on the fifteenth of May, one thousand eight hundred and twenty, shall revive and be in full force: "
And whereas, by an act of the British Parliament, which passed on the fifth day of July, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and twentyfive, entitled " An act to repeal the several laws relating to the customs," the said act of Parliament of the twenty-fourth of June, one thousand eight hundred and twenty-two, was repealed; and by another act of the British Parliament, passed on the fifth day of July, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and twenty-five, in the sixth year of the reign of George the Fourth, entitled " An Act to regulate the trade of the British possessions abroad," and by an order of His Britannic Majesty in Council, bearing date the twentyseventh of July, one thousand eight hundred and twenty-six, the trade and intercourse authorized by the aforesaid act of Parliament, of the twenty-fourth of June, one thousand eight hundred and twenty-two, between the United States and the greater part of the said British Colonial ports therein enumerated, have been prohibited upon and from the first day of December last past, and the contingency has thereby arisen on which the President of the United States was authorized by the sixth section aforesaid of the act of Congress of first March, one thousand eight hundred and twenty-three, to issue a proclamation
to the effect therein mentioned: Now, therefore, I, John Quincy Adams, President of the United States of
America, do hereby declare and proclaim that the trade and intercourse authorized by the said act of Parliament of the twenty-fourth of June, one thousand eight hundred and twenty-two, between the United States and the British Colonial ports enumerated in the aforesaid act of Congress of the first of March, one thousand eight hundred and twenty-three, have been, and are, upon and from the first day of December, one thousand eight hundred and twentysix, by the aforesaid two several acts of Parliament of the fifth of July, one thousand eight hundred and twenty-five, and by the aforesaid British order in Council of the twenty-seventh day of July, one thousand eight hundred and
twenty-six, prohibited.
Given under my hand, at the City of Washington, this seventeenth day of March, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and twentyseven, and the fifty-first year of the Independence of the United States.

The court will not award a commission to take the testimony of absent witnesses until the commis-

sioners are named. Van Stephorst v. The state of Maryland, 2 Dall. 401 ; 1 Cond. Rep. 2.

Under particular circumstances the court allowed a special commission, to take the depositions of

witnesses, with instructions : 1. That the interrogatories should be filed in the court here by both par-

ties previous to the issuing of the commission. 2. That the commissioners should be directed not to

admit any additional interrogatories. 3. That neither parties nor counsel should be allowed to appear

before the commissioners. Cunningham v. Otis, 1 Gallis. C. C. R. 166. Commissioners to take depositions of witnesses, act under a special authority derived from the court,

which must be strictly pursued ; and, therefore, where a commission had issued to four commissioners

jointly to take depositions, and it was executed and returned by three only, although both of the com-

missioners nominated by the defendant, had acted ; yet he may object to the reading of the depositions,

and the objections will be sustained. Armstrong v. Brown, 1 Wash. C. C. R. 34. A commission to take testimony, which had issued in a case in which the United States was a

party, was set aside, because it had been opened by an officer of the government before it came into the

hands of the clerk, and a new commission was ordered, to which the original papers, which had been

annexed to the first commission, were attached. The United States v. Price's Adm'rs, 2 Wash. C. C.

R. 356.

A commission to take evidence in an enemy's country, in a prize cause, is contrary to the established

practice in a prize court. The Diana, 2 Gallis. C. C. R. 93. Each interrogatory, annexed to the commission, should be substantially answered, at least; and the

omission, so to answer, is fatal to the whole testimony of the witness: although, in his answer to the

general interrogatory, the witness has said he knows nothing material to either party. Zetland v. Bis-

sett, I Wash. C. C. R. 144.

Where a commission to take evidence was executed in a foreign country, the government of which re-

fused to let the commissioners act, considering it an assumption ofthe sovereign power, but the commis-

sion was executed by a judge of the court in the presence of the commissioners; the depositions were per-

mitted to be read, as otherwise the course of justice might be impeded. In such a case the evidence must

be fairly taken ; all the evidence on each side must be put and answered. If, however, the interroga-

tories have been substantially put and answered, it is sufficient. Winthrop v. The Union Ins. Co., 2 Wash. C. C. R. 7.

It is no objection to the reading of a deposition, taken under a commission to a foreign country, that

the same witness had been previously examined and cross-examined in the United States. Ibid.

A joint commission to take the depositions of witnesses, must be executed by all the commissioners,

testimony of a witness or witnesses, at any place within the United States, or the territories thereof, it shall be lawful for the clerk of any court of the United States, for the district or territory within which such place may be, and he is hereby enjoined and required, upon

to make the depositions evidence, although the commissioners named by the party making the objection, after proceeding some length in the examination of the witnesses, withdrew. Muns v. Dupont, 2 Wash. C. C. R. 563.
The provision of the judiciary act of 1789, ch. 20, sec. 30, as to taking depositions, de bene esse, does not apply to cases pending in the Supreme Court of the United States, but only to cases in the district and circuit courts. Testimony, by depositions, can only be regularly taken for the Supreme Court, under a commission issuing according to the rules of the court. The Argo, 2 Wheat. 287 ; 4 Cond. Rep. 119.
Depositions taken according to the proviso in the 13th section of the judiciary act of 1789, ch. 20, under a " dedimus potestatem," " according to common usage, where it may be necessary to prevent a failure or delay of justice," are,under no circumstances, to be considered as taken de bene esse, whether the witness reside beyond the process of the court, or within it: the provision of the act relative to depositions, de bene esse, being confined to those taken under the enacting part of the section. Sergeant's Lessee v. Biddle et al. 4 Wheat. 508; 4 Cond. Rep. 522.
A commission was issued in the name of Richard M. Meade, the name of the party being Richard W. Meade. This is a clerical error in making out the commission, and does not affect the execution of the commission. Keene v. Meade, 3 Peters, 1.
It is not known that there is any practice in the execution or return of a commission, requiring a certificate, in whose handwriting the depositions returned with the commission were set down. All that the commission requires, is, that the commissioners, having reduced the depositions taken by them to writing, should send them with the commission, under their hands and seals, to the judges of the court out of which the commission issued. But it is immaterial in whose handwriting the depositions are ; and it cannot be required that they should certify any immaterial fact. Ibid. 8.
A certificate by the commissioners, that A. B., whom they were going to employ as a clerk, had been sworn, admits of no other reasonable interpretation than that A. B. was the person appointed by them as clerk. Ibid. 9.
It is not necessary to return with the commission the form of the oath administered by the commissioners to the witnesses. When the commissioners certify the witnesses were sworn, and the interrogatories annexed to the commission were all put to them, it is presumed that they were sworn and examined as to all their knowledge of the facts. Ibid. 10.
The plaintiffs issued a commission to take testimony abroad, and the defendant joined in the same, by filing cross-interrogatories, but the plaintiffs afterwards found a witness to prove the facts they desired to establish by the commission ; and they abandoned it. The court said a trial under those circumstances, would be a surprise on the defendant. Le Roy v. The Delaware Ins. Co., 2 Wash. C. C. ju. 223.
If the cross-interrogatories are not put to a witness examined under a commission to take testimony, the examination of the witness cannot be read on the trial. Gilpins v. Consequa, Peters' C. C. R. 86.
It is no objection to a deposition taken under a commission to Holland, that it is in the English language, the commissioners before whom it was taken being Dutchmen, and not stating that they had the assistance of an interpreter. Ibid.
It is not an objection to the evidence taken under a commission, that the cross-interrogatories were not put to each witness, immediately after he had answered the chief interrogatories, but were put to him after all the chief interrogatories had been answered by all the witnesses. Ibid.
A commission is not defectively executed, because the commissioners and their clerk were not sworn. Ibid.
Those who execute a commission are appointed by the court, and although they may be nominated by the parties, they are not their agents. Ibid.
If all the interrogatories, which accompany a commission, are substantially, although not severally answered, it is sufficient; and this principle applies as well to the answers given to the interrogatories annexed to letters rogatory, as to answers under a commission. Nelson v. The United States, Peters' C. C. R. 235.
The circuit court of the United States will issue letters rogatory, for the purpose of obtaining the testimony of witnesses, when the government of the place where the evidence is to be obtained will not permit a commission to be executed. Ibid.
The testimony of a witness, taken under a commission, directed to five persons, or any one of them, cannot be read in evidence if another person than the commissioner, and who was not named in the commission, assisted in taking the examinations of the witnesses. Willings v. Consequa, Peters' C. C.R. 301.
A commission directed to A. to be executed in one county, cannot be executed by him in another. The commissioner ought to state when and where the commission was executed. He acts under a special authority. The depositions were rejected, being obnoxious to this principle. Bourdereau et al. v. Montgomery et al., 4 Wash. C. C. R. 186.
If the general interrogatory, under a commission, is not answered, it is a fatal objection to the whole deposition ; all the interrogatories must be substantially answered. Dodge v. Israel, 4 Wash. C. C. R. 323.
Query, If it is not an objection to a deposition, that it was committed to writing by the witness before he was sworn ; and whether exhibits, referred to in a deposition, ought not to be annexed by the commissioners to the deposition, or so designated by them as to leave no reasonable doubt of their identity. Ibid.
If reasonable notice of formal objections to the depositions taken under a commission, be not given, the court may be induced to set aside a verdict or nonsuit rendered in consequence of this objection, without costs. Ibid.
Depositions taken, under a commission, to another state, cannot be read, unless proof be given

like manner as any court of the United States may do in case of disobedience to process of subpoena ad testificandum, issued by such court; and the witness or witnesses, in such cases, shall be allowed the same compensation as is allowed to witnesses attending the courts of the United States: Provided, That no witness shall be required to attend at any place out of the county in which he may reside, nor more than forty miles from his place of residence, to give his or her deposition, under this law.

And be it further enacted, That whenever either of the parties in such suit, cause, action, or proceeding, shall apply to any judge of a court of the United States, in the district or territory of the United States, in which the place for taking such testimony may be, for a subpoena duces tecum, commanding the witness, therein to be named, to appear and testify before the said commissioner or commissioners, at the time and place in the said subpoena to be stated, and also to bring or carry with him or her, and produce to such commissioner or commissioners, any paper, writing, or written instrument, or book, or other document supposed to be in the possession or power of such witness, such judge being satisfied, by the affidavit of the person applying, or otherwise, that there is reason to believe that such paper, writing, written instrument, book, or other document, is in the possession or power of the witness, and that the same, if produced, would be competent and material evidence for the parly applying therefor, may order the clerk of the court, of which he is a judge, to issue such subpoena duces tecum, accordingly, and if such witness, after being duly served with such subpoena duces tecum, shall fail to produce any such paper, writing, written instrument, book, or other document, being in the possession or power of such witness, and described in such

witness or witnesses, at any place within the United States, or the territories thereof, it shall be lawful for the clerk of any court of the United States, for the district or territory within which such place may be, to issue a subpoena, or subpoenas, for such witness or witnesses named in said commission.

that a copy of the interrogatories, and a written notice of the rule for a commission, and the names of the commissioners, were served on the opposite party or his attorney, according to one of the rules of the circuit court of Pennsylvania. Lessee of Rhoads and Snyder v. Selin, 4 Wash. C. C. R. 715.
It is no objection to a deposition, that a material part of the evidence comes out under the general interrogatory. Ibid.
A commission was issued under a rule to take depositions at Selinsgrove, and was endorsed " commission to Selinsgrove." It should appear, by the certificate of the commissioners, or otherwise, that the depositions were taken at the place indicated, or they cannot be read. Ibid.
Affidavits to be used as further proof, in causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction in the Supreme Court, must be taken by commission. The London Packet, 2 Wheat. 371 ; 4 Cond. Rep. 162.
A deposition taken under a commission is fatally defective, if the general interrogatory, "Do you know any thing further," &c., is not answered. Richardson v. Golden, 3 Wash. C. C. R. 109.
If a commission issue to A. & B., or either of them, to take the depositions of witnesses, the depositions of A. may be taken before B. Lonsdale v. Brown, 3 Wash. C. C. R. 404.
Evidence to establish heirship and pedigree, had been obtained under a commission issued for that purpose to France, in an action of ejectment, in which the plaintiffs had recovered the lots of ground for
which the suit was instituted. In the course of that trial, a bill of exceptions was tendered by the plaintiffs and sealed by the court, in which the evidence contained in the commission was inserted. The commission, and the testimony obtained under it, were afterwards lost. In an action for mesne profits brought by the plaintiffs in the ejectment, against the landlord of the defendant in the suit, who had employed counsel to oppose the claims of the plaintiffs, but who was not a party to the suit on
record ; it was held, by the Supreme Court, that the testimony, as copied into the bill of exceptions, was legal and competent evidence of pedigree. Chirac v. Reinecker, 2 Peters, 613.

ARTICLES OF A TREATY

Made and concluded at the Butte des Morts, on Fox river, in the Territory of Michigan, between Lewis Cass and Thomas L. MKenney, Commissioners on the part of the United States, and the Chippewa, Menomonie, and Winebago tribes of Indians.

Aug. 11, 1827. Proclamation, Feb. 23, 1829.

Art ic le 1. Whereas, the southern boundary of the Chippewa country, from the Plover Portage of the Ouisconsin easterly, was left undefined by the treaty concluded at Prairie du Chien, August 19, 1825, in consequence of the non-attendance of some of the principal Menomonie chiefs; and, whereas it was provided by the said treaty, that, whenever the President of the United States might think proper, such of the tribes, parties to the said treaty, as might be interested in any particular line, should be convened, in order to agree upon its establishment;
Therefore, in pursuance of the said provision, it is agreed between the Chippewas, Menomonies and Winebagoes, that the southern boundary of the Chippeway country shall run as follows, namely: From the Plover Portage of the Ouisconsin, on a northeasterly course, to a point on Wolf river, equidistant from the Ashawano and Post lakes of said river, thence to the falls of the Pashaytig river of Green Bay; thence to the junction of the Neesau Kootag or Burnt-wood river, with the Menomonie ; thence to the big island of the Shoskinaubic or Smooth rock river; thence following the channel of the-said river to Green Bay, which it strikes between the little and the great Bay de Noquet.
Art . 2. Much difficulty having arisen from the negociations between the Menomonie and Winebago tribes and the various tribes and portions of tribes of Indians of the State of New York, and the claims of the respective parties being much contested, as well with relation to the tenure and boundaries of the two tracts, claimed by the said New York Indians, west of Lake Michigan, as to the authority of the persons who

signed the agreement on the part of the Menomonies, and the whole subject having been fully examined at the Council this day concluded, and the allegations, proofs, and statements, of the respective parties * having been entered upon the Journal of the Commissioners, so that the same can be decided by the President of the United States; it is agreed by the Menomonies and Winebagoes, that so far as respects their interest in the premises, the whole matter shall be referred to the President of the United States, whose decision shall be final. And the President is authorized, on their parts, to establish such boundaries between
them and the New York Indians as he may consider equitable and just.

Indian recognition of U. S. title to a certain tract of land. Boundaries thereof.
Proviso. Proviso.

Art . 3. It being important to the settlement of Green Bay that definite boundaries should be established between the tract claimed by the former French and British governments, and the lands of the Indians, as well to avoid future disputes as to settle the question of jurisdiction--It is therefore agreed between the Menomonie tribe and the United States, that the boundaries of the said tracts, the jurisdiction and title of which are hereby acknowledged to be in the United States, shall be as follows, namely:--Beginning on the shore of Green Bay, six miles due north from the parallel of the mouth of Fox river, and running thence in a straight line, but with the general course of the said river, and six miles therefrom to the intersection of the continuation of the westerly boundary of the tract at the Grand Kaukaulin, claimed by Augustin Grignion; thence on a line with the said boundary to the same; thence with the same to Fox river; thence on the same course, six miles; thence in a direct line to the southwestern boundary of the tract, marked on the plan of the claims at Green Bay, as the settlement at the bottom of the Bay; thence with the southerly boundary of the said tract to the southeasterly corner thereof; and thence with the easterly boundary of the said tract to Green Bay. Provided, that if the President of the United States should be of opinion that the boundaries thus established interfere with any just claims of the New York Indians, the President may then change the said boundaries in any manner he may think proper, so that the quantity of land contained in the said tract be not greater than by the boundaries herein defined. And provided also, that nothing herein contained shall be construed to have any effect upon the land claims at Green Bay; but the same shall remain as though this treaty had not been formed.

Distribution of goods among the Indians.

Art . 4. In consideration of the liberal establishment of the boundaries as herein provided for, the Commissioners of the United States have this day caused to be distributed among the Indians, goods to the amount of fifteen thousand six hundred and eighty-two dollars, payment
for which shall be made by the United States. 

Annual appropriation foreducation of Indians.

Art . 5. The sum of one thousand dollars shall be annually appropriated for the term of three years; and the sum of fifteen hundred dollars shall be annually thereafter appropriated as long as Congress think proper, for the education of the children of the tribes, parties hereto, and of the New York Indians, to be expended under the direction of the President of the United States.

Right of U. S. to punish certain Winnebagoes.
Treaty to be obligatory when ratified.

Art . 6. The United States shall be at liberty, notwithstanding the Winebagoes are parties to this treaty, to pursue such measures as they may think proper for the punishment of the perpetrators of the recent outrages at Prairie du Chien, and upon the Mississippi, and for the prevention of such acts hereafter.
Art . 7. This treaty shall be obligatory after its ratification by the President and Senate of the United States.

II ne sera rien paye pour la partie de la cargaison que le batiment remportera, et avec la quelle il pourra continuer sa route pour un ou plusieurs autres ports du meme pays, et y disposer du reste de sa cargaison, si elle est composee d'objets dont 1'importation est permise, en payant les droits qui y sont applicables, ou bien il pourra s'en aller dans tout autre pays. Il est cependant entendu que les droits, impots ou charges quelconques, qui sont ou seront payables pour les batimens memes, doivent etre acquittes au premier port ou ils romproient le chargement, ou en dechargeroient une partie, mais qu'aucuns droits, impots ou charges pareils ne seront demandes de nouveau dans les ports du meme pays ou lesdits batimens pourroient vouloir entrer apres, a moins que les nationaux ne soient sujets a quelques droits ulterieurs dans le meme cas.

ARTICLE XIII. Chacune des Hautes Parties Contractantes accorde a 1'autre la faculte d' entretenir dans ses ports et places de commerce, des Consuls, Vice Consuls, ou Agens de Commerce, qui jouiront de toute la protection, et recevront toute 1'assistance necessaire pour remplir duement leurs fonctions; mais il est expressement declare que dans le cas d'une conduite illegale ou impropre envers les lois ou le gouvernement du pays dans lequels lesdits Consuls, Vice Consuls, ou Agens Commerciaux, resideroient ils pourront etre poursuivis et punis conformement aux lois et prives de 1'exercice de leurs fonctions par le Gouvernement offense qui fera connoitre a 1'autre ses motifs pour avoir agi ainsi, bien entendu cependant que les archives et documens relatifs aux affaires du Consulat seront a 1'abri de toute recherche, et devront etre soigneusement conserves sous le scelie des Consuls, Vice Consuls, ou Agens Commerciaux, et de 1'autorite de 1'endroit ou ils resideroient.

Bien entendu que cette espece de jugement ou d'arbitrage ne sauroit pourtant priver les parties contendantes du droit qu'elles ont, a leur retour de recourir aux autorites judiciares de leur patrie.

ARTICLE XIV.

Les dits Consuls, Vice Consuls, ou Agens, Commerciaux, seront

autorises a requerir 1'assistance des autorites locales pour 1'arrestation,
