of the Treasury be, and he is hereby, authorized to pay, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, to Ross Engineer-

ing Company, of Washington , District of Columbia, the sum of $5,964.22. Such sum represents the amount of occupation taxes,

interest, and penalties, paid by Ross Engineering Company, herein called the contractor, to the State of West Virginia, in connection with the contractor's contract with the Federal Works Agency, Public

Buildings Administration , for the construction of a post office and courthouse at Fairmont, West Virginia. The contract was entered into on July 26, 1940, and was to be performed within three hundred

and sixty days thereafter upon a Federal area over which the United

States exercised exclusive jurisdiction by virtue of a grant from the Legislature of West Virginia, which reserved to the State only the

right of the State to serve process thereon. At the time such contract

was entered into the State of West Virginia had no authority to levy

or collect from the contractor any State taxes with respect thereto,

and in estimating the cost of the work the contractor excluded all

State taxes. After such contract had been entered into and partly performed by the contractor, the Congress enacted an Act ( Public , Numbered 819, Seventy-sixth Congress ) , approved October 9, 1940,

54 Stat. 1059. 4 U. S. C. §§ 12-18.

and effective January 1, 1941 , which relaxed the exclusive jurisdiction

exercised by the United States over various Federal areas so as to permit the several States to levy and collect from contractors under

Government contracts, and others , sales, use , and income taxes , not

theretofore collectible by the several States, because of the exclusive

jurisdiction exercised by the United States over the Federal area. Acting in pursuance of this Act of Congress the State of West

Virginia was enabled to levy and collect from the contractor the sum above referred to as an occupation tax of 2 per centum upon the

gross income from the contract received after January 1 , 1941.

FLAG DAY, 1944
BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
A PROCLAMATION
For many years June 14 has been set aside as Flag Day, observed throughout the Nation as a day of earnest rededication to those high principles of humanity and civilization which constitute the foundations of the Republic.
It is not necessary to recite that the stars and stripes of our flag symbolize the patriotic and loyal unity of one hundred and thirtyfive million people in a widely diversified land . Nor is it necessary to dwell on the struggles through which we have marched, under

58 STAT.]

May 3, 1944 PROCLAMATIONS--
June 16, 1944

that flag, to our present great part in the world's affairs . What we are, and what we do, speak of these things far more eloquently than any words.

Ours is a flag of battles . On the ships of our Navy, in the vanguard

of our soldiers and marines , it is carrying liberation and succor into stricken lands. It is carrying our message of promise and freedo.m into all corners of the world.
Ours is also a flag of peace. Under its protection, men have found refuge from oppression . Under its promise, men have found release from hatreds and prejudice , from exploitation and persecution . It is the flag under which men and women of varied heritage , creed, and
race may work and live or , if need be, fight and die together as only free men and women can .

Let us then display our flag proudly, knowing that it symbolizes
the strong and constructive ideals- the democratic ideals--which we
oppose to the evil of our enemies. Let us display our flag, and the flags of all the United Nations which fight beside us, to symbolize our
joint brotherhood , our joint dedication , under God , to the cause of unity and the freedom of men .
NOW, THEREFORE , I , FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT , President Observance of June 14, 1944 as Flag Day.
of the United States of America , do hereby ask that on Flag Day,

June 14, 1944 , the people of our Nation honor especially the members

of the armed forces - men and women equally -whose unfaltering

devotion to our national ideals has given the Nation's flag a new and hopeful meaning for those struggling against oppression in lands still held by our enemies .
I direct the officials of the Federal Government and I request the officials of the State and local governments to have our colors displayed on all public buildings on Flag Day, and I urge the people of the United States on that day to fly the American flag from their homes, and to arrange , where feasible, for joint displays of the emblems of the freedom-loving United Nations without whose staunch collaboration we could not have hoped for victory.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed .

THANKSGIVING DAY, 1944 BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
A PROCLAMATION

In this year of liberation, which has seen so many millions freed from tyrannical rule, it is fitting that we give thanks with special fervor to our Heavenly Father for the mercies we have received individually and as a nation and for the blessings He has restored, through the victories of our arms and those of our Allies, to His children in other lands.

For the preservation of our way of life from the threat of destruction ; for the unity of spirit which has kept our Nation strong ; for our abiding faith in freedom; and for the promise of an enduring peace, we should lift up our hearts in thanksgiving.
For the harvest that has sustained us and, in its fullness , brought succor to other peoples ; for the bounty of our soil , which has produced the sinews of war for the protection of our liberties ; and for a multitude of private blessings, known only in our hearts , we should give united thanks to God.

To the end that we may bear more earnest witness to our gratitude

to Almighty God, I suggest a nationwide reading of the Holy

Scriptures during the period from Thanksgiving Day to Christmas.

Let every man of every creed go to his own version of the Scriptures for a renewed and strengthening contact with those eternal truths

and majestic principles which have inspired such measure of true greatness as this nation has achieved .

Dated NEW DELHI, the 29th September 1942. SIR,
I enclose a copy of the United States of America (Visiting Forces) Act, 1942 which has recently been enacted in the United Kingdom . The military authorities of the United States of America in India have long been anxious that similar legislation should be enacted in India which is not included in the territories to which the United Kingdom Act can be applied by Order in Council under section 3 thereof. A draft Ordinance, ['] of which a copy is enclosed has been prepared with a view to give effect to their wishes .
2. You will observe that the United Kingdom Act is expressed to give effect to the Agreement recorded in the Notes exchanged between His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of the United States of America , and that those Notes are set out in a Schedule to the Act. It is felt that the Indian Ordinance
should in like manner give effect to an Agreement in the like sense between the Government of India and the Government of the United
States of America, and I would propose for your consideration that this letter read with your reply thereto be regarded as constituting an

DEAR MR. WEIGHTMAN :

OCTOBER 10, 1942

I have sent you under separate cover this morning the formal agreement of the Government of the United States to the proposals contained in your note No. 8491- X/42 of September 29, whereby the American military authorities in India would be given exclusive jurisdiction over criminal offences which may be committed in India by members of those Forces.

I should be glad to know for the information of my Government whether the proposed ordinance would have any application in Indian States. If it will not apply, can you give me an idea as to the status

of American troops who might conceivably become involved in incidents of one sort or another in a native state. As you know, American military personnel are in some cases stationed in native states and

there is always the possibility that troops might have to enter or pass

through these states in the performance of their duty. Any clari-

fication of these points which you may be able to give me would be much appreciated .

Sincerely yours ,

Will you please refer to your D.O. letter No. 710/820 , dated the 10th October, 1942 , enquiring whether the proposed Allied Forces (U.S.A.) Ordinance would have application in the Indian States?
I am desired to say that it is intended that the Ordinance , when

promulgated, should be brought to the notice of the Residents in the Indian States , who will be informed that His Excellency the Crown Representative has decided that no Criminal proceedings shall be taken in any State court against any member of the U. S. A. armed forces. For all practical purposes therefore the position will be identical in British India and in the States.

London, October 1, 1942.

With reference to your letter of March 18, 1942 [ ¹ ] ( No. W 2555/

247/49 ) , to Shantz concerning the proposed legislation to enlarge the

jurisdiction of the United States Courts in certain cases of prize, I wish to inform you that Public Law 704-77th Congress, enacted to facilitate the disposition of prizes captured by the United States during the present war, and for other purposes, was approved on August

56 Stat. 746. 50 U. S. C., Supp.
IIIA,natpep, p. .§§67882.1-828.

18, 1942. [2 ] A copy of the Act is enclosed.

This Act, it will be noted , relates only to prizes captured during the

present war.

The special prize commissioners which the district courts of the

United States are authorized to appoint may exercise abroad the duties

which are prescribed by Law for such commissioners and such ad-

ditional duties as the district courts may confer on them for carrying

out the purposes of the Act. The duties of prize commissioners are set out in Title 34 U.S.C. Section 1138 which reads as follows :

"§ 1138. Duties of prize commissioners. The prize commis-

sioners, or one of them , shall receive from the prize master the

documents and papers, and inventory thereof, and shall take the

affidavit of the prize master required by section 1134 of this title,

and shall forthwith take the testimony of the witnesses sent in,

separate from each other, on interrogatories prescribed by the court, in the manner usual in prize courts ; and the witnesses shall

not be permitted to see the interrogatories, documents, or papers,

or to consult with counsel , or with any persons interested without

special authority from the court ; and witnesses who have the

rights of neutrals shall be discharged as soon as practicable. The

prize commissioners shall also take depositions de bene esse of

the prize crew and others, at the request of the district attorney,

on interrogatories prescribed by the court. They shall also, as soon as any prize property comes within the district for adjudica-

tion, examine the same, and make an inventory thereof, founded

on an actual examination, and report to the court whether any part of it is in a condition requiring immediate sale for the interests of all parties, and notify the district attorney thereof ; and if it be necessary to the examination or making of the inventory that the cargo be unladen , they shall apply to the court for an order to the marshal to unlade the same, and shall, from time to time, report to the court anything relating to the condition of the property, or its custody or disposal , which may require any action by the court, but the custody of the property shall be in the marshal only. They shall also seasonably return into court, sealed and secured from inspection , the documents and papers which shall come to their hands , duly scheduled and numbered , and the other preparatory evidence, and the evidence taken de bene esse, and their own inventory of the prize property ; and if the captured vessel, or any of its cargo or stores, are such as in their judgment may be useful to the United States in war, they shall report the same to the Secretary of the Navy."

56 Stat. 746, 747. 50 U. S. C., Supp. III, app. §§ 823, 827.

Upon the receipt from your Government of the consent required by Section 3 of the Act, the Government of the United States will take appropriate measures in accordance with Section 7 of the Act to con-

fer reciprocal privileges with respect to prizes upon your Government. Yours sincerely,

W. J. GALLMAN.

"the district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all prizes "captured during the present war on the high seas if said capture "was made by authority of the United States or was adopted and "ratified by the President of the United States and the prize was

United Kingdom hereby give the consent referred to in Section 3

above quoted in respect of the United Kingdom and Sierra Leone.

5. His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom have been

glad to observe that the government of the United States is ready to take appropriate measures, in accordance with Section 7 of the Act, to confer upon them reciprocal facilities with respect to prizes.

SIR :

Reference is made to the Legation's memorandum of April 15, 1943 [ 1 ] stating that the Canadian Government would be glad to make an arrangement with the Government of the United States concerning the exercise by either country in the territorial waters of the

57 Stat. 729.

other of jurisdiction in cases of prize. Reference was made to the arrangement with the United Kingdom referred to in the President's Proclamation No. 2575 of January 30, 1943.

of prizes captured by the United States during the present war, and for other purposes, was approved on August 18, 1942. [2 ] A copy of the Act is enclosed.
It will be perceived from section 3 of the Act that jurisdiction of

prizes brought into the territorial waters of a cobelligerent shall not

be exercised under the authority of the Act, nor shall prizes be taken

or appropriated within such territorial waters for the use of the

United States, unless the Government having jurisdiction over such

territorial waters consents thereto . It is therefore suggested that your

Government notify me of its consent to the exercise of such authority within its territorial waters as well as of its acquiescence in the exercise in Canada by special prize commissioners of the duties prescribed for them in cases arising under the Act referred to. In this connection your attention is called to section 5 of the Act. It will be noted therefrom that the district courts of the United States may confer on such special commissioners such powers and duties, in addition to those already prescribed for prize commissioners , as may be deemed necessary or proper for carrying out the purposes of the Act. The duties of prize commissioners are set out in Title 34 , U.S.C. , Section 1138, which reads as follows :

"§1138. Duties of prize commissioners . The prize commis-
sioners, or one of them, shall receive from the prize master the

The prize commissioners shall also take depositions de bene esse of the prize crew and others, at the request of the district attorney, on interrogatories prescribed by the court. They shall also, as soon as any prize property comes within the district for adjudication, examine the same, and make an inventory thereof, founded on an actual examination , and report to the court whether any part of it is in a condition requiring immediate sale for the interests of all parties, and notify the district attorney thereof ; and if it be necessary to the examination or making of the inventory that the cargo be unladen, they shall apply to the court for an order to the marshal to unlade the same, and shall , from time to time, report to the court anything relating to the condition of the property, or its custody or disposal , which may require any action by the court , but the custody of the property shall be in the marshal only. They shall also seasonably return into court, sealed and secured from inspection, the documents and papers which shall come to their hands, duly scheduled and numbered, and the other preparatory evidence, and the evidence taken de bene esse, and their own inventory of the prize property ; and if the captured vessel, or any of its cargo or stores , are such as in their judgment may be useful to the United States in war, they shall report the same to the Secretary of the Navy."

Upon the receipt from the Canadian Government of the consent required by section 3 of the Act , this Government will take appropriate measures in accordance with section 7 of the Act to confer

(a) That by United States of America Public Law 704, 77th Congress entitled "An Act to Facilitate the Disposition of Prizes Captured by the United States during the Present War, and for Other Purposes", the District Courts of the said United States are given original jurisdiction of all prizes captured during the present war on the high seas if said capture is made by authority of the said United States or is adopted and ratified by the President thereof and the prize is brought into the territorial waters of a cobelligerent or is taken or appro-

priated for the use of the United States on the high seas or in such territorial waters, including jurisdiction of all proceedings for the condemnation of such property taken as a prize. (b) Section 3 of the said Act provides that the said jurisdiction of prizes brought into the territorial waters of a cobelligerent shall not be exercised , nor shall prizes be taken or appropriated within such territorial waters for the use of the said United States unless the Government having jurisdiction over such territorial waters consents to the exercise of such jurisdiction or to such taking or appropriation. (c) Section 7 of the said Act provides that a cobelligerent, which consents to the exercise of the said jurisdiction with respect to prizes of the said United States brought into its territorial waters and to the taking or appropriation of such prizes within its territorial waters for the use of the said United States, shall be accorded, upon Proclamation by the President, like privileges with respect to prizes captured under authority of such cobelligerent and brought into the territorial waters of the said United States or taken or appropriated in such territorial waters for the use of such cobelligerent and that reciprocal recognition and full faith and credit shall be given to the jurisdiction acquired by Courts of a cobelligerent thereunder and to all proceedings had or judgments rendered in the exercise of such jurisdiction. (d ) The Government of the United Kingdom, a cobelligerent, has consented to the exercise of this jurisdiction with respect to prizes of the United States of America brought in, taken or appropriated within the territorial waters of the United Kingdom and Sierra Leone and the United States Government by a proclamation of the President of the United States dated 30th January, 1943, has accorded the United Kingdom Government like privileges with respect to the prizes captured under the authority of the said Government and brought in, taken or appropriated in the territorial waters of the said United States. (e) By Order in Council P.C. 2489 of September 5th , 1939, the Exchequer Court of Canada on its Admiralty side is constituted and established a Prize Court and is thereby authorized and
required to take cognizance of and judicially proceed upon all and all manner of captures, seizures, prizes and reprisals of all ships, vessels and goods. (f) It is expedient and desirable, in view of the close coordination of effort in respect of maritime warfare that exists between the United States of America and Canada that the Dominion of
Canada should enter into a reciprocal arrangement with the said United States regarding jurisdiction of all prizes brought into the territorial waters of the other or taken or appropriated for their use in such territorial waters.

1213

(g) The Under- Secretary of State for External Affairs reports that the Secretary of State of the United States has given assurance that, upon receipt of the consent of the Government of

Canada, as required by Sec. 3 of the Act above referred to, the said United States will take appropriate measures in accordance with Sec. 7 of the said Act to confer reciprocal privileges with respect to prizes upon the Government of Canada.

Consent of Canada to U. S. jurisdiction .

(h) The Chief of Naval Staff and the Deputy Minister for Naval Services report that it would tend to the best interests of the Naval Service if such a reciprocal arrangement were entered into.
2. Therefore, His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of National Defence for Naval

Services, concurred in by the Secretary of State for External Affairs and under and by virtue of the War Measures Act, Chapter 206 of the Revised Statutes of Canada , 1927, and notwithstanding the provisions of any other statute, order or regulation, is pleased to consent to and doth hereby consent to and authorize the exercise of original jurisdiction by the District Courts of the United States of America of all

prizes captured during the present war on the high seas if said capture was made by authority of the said United States or was adopted and ratified by the President of the said United States and the prize was brought into the territorial waters of Canada or was taken or appropriated for the use of the said United States on the high seas or in such territorial waters including the jurisdiction of all pro-

ceedings for the condemnation of such property taken as prize. A. D. P. HEENEY,

EXCELLENCY :

I have the honor to refer to the Department's note of March 12 ,

1943 [1] concerning an agreement between the United States and Bel-

gium relating to the jurisdiction of American Service courts over members of the armed forces of the United States in the Belgian Congo.
It is the desire of the Government of the United States that the

diction over criminal offenses which may be committed in the Belgian

If cases arise in which for special reasons the Service authorities of

this Government may prefer not to exercise the above jurisdiction , it

is proposed that in any such case a written statement to that effect

shall be sent to the Belgian Government through diplomatic channels,

in which event it would be open to the Belgian authorities to assume

jurisdiction . Assurance is given that the Service courts and authorities of the

Mutual assistance in preliminary action.

The competent American authorities will be prepared to cooperate

with the authorities of the Belgian Congo in setting up a satisfactory

procedure for affording such mutual assistance as may be required in

making investigations and collecting evidence with respect to offenses

alleged to have been committed by members of the armed forces of the

United States. As a general rule it would probably be desirable that preliminary action be taken by the authorities of the Belgian Congo on behalf of the American authorities where the witnesses or other persons from whom it is desired to obtain testimony are not members

of the United States forces. In the prosecution in the courts of the Belgian Congo of persons who are not members of the United States

forces but where members of such forces are in any way concerned , the

Service authorities of the United States will be glad to render such

assistance as is possible in obtaining testimony of members of such

SIR :

I have the honor to refer to Your Excellency's letter of March 31st,

concerning an agreement between the United States and Belgium relating to the jurisdiction of American Service courts over members of the armed forces of the United States in the Belgian Congo.

The Belgian Government assumes that in this arrangement the words "criminal offenses" include all criminal offenses within the law

of the Belgian Congo. My Government also assumes that this ar-

rangement provides only for the punishment of criminal offenses and that all actions ( actions civiles ) involving the collection of damages

for injury which may be caused by such offenses will remain within the province of the courts of the Belgian Congo.

EXCELLENCY :

I have the honor to refer to your note no. 2689 of May 27, 1943 with further reference to jurisdiction of American Service courts over mem-

bers of the armed forces of the United States in the Belgian Congo. The words " criminal offenses" in the proposed agreement were
intended to include all such offenses committed in the Belgian Congo.

" Criminal offenses."

Of course military courts of the United States cannot apply the law
of the Belgian Congo as such. It is assumed however that offenses
under that law would also be offenses under the law of the United Common law of-
States. In this connection it may be pointed out that courts-martial fenses.

of the United States have jurisdiction over common law offenses as will be indicated by the following provisions of the Articles of War

(Act of June 4, 1920 , 41 Stat . 787) : Article 92 : "Any person subject to military law who commits murder or

41 Stat. 805. 10 U. S. C. § 1564.

rape shall suffer death or imprisonment for life, as a court-martial may direct ; but no person shall be tried by court-martial for murder or rape committed within the geographical limits of the States of the Union and the District of Columbia in time of peace."
Article 93 states :

41 Stat. 805. 10 U. S. C. § 1565.

"Any person subject to military law who commits manslaughter,

mayhem, arson, burglary, housebreaking, robbery, larceny,

embezzlement, perjury, forgery, sodomy, assault with intent to

commit any felony, assault with intent to do bodily harm with a

dangerous weapon, instrument, or other thing, or assault with

intent to do bodily harm, shall be punished as a court-martial may direct."

1218

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [ 58 STAT.

41 Stat. 806. 10 U. S. C. § 1568.

Article 96 provides : "Though not mentioned in these articles, all disorders and

neglects to the prejudice of good order and military discipline, all conduct of a nature to bring discredit upon the military service, and all crimes or offenses not capital, of which persons subject to

military law may be guilty, shall be taken cognizance of by a general or special or summary court-martial, according to the

nature and degree of the offense, and punished at the discretion of such court."

Offenses in violation of local laws.
41 Stat.
10 U. s. 0.891564, 1565, 1568.

Offenses against local laws not specifically mentioned in Articles 92 and 93 of the Articles of War may be adequately punished under Article 96 as offenses of a nature to bring discredit upon the military service. It is believed that this matter is adequately covered by the

fourth paragraph of my note of March 31 , 1943 which gives assurance that the service courts and authorities of the United States will be

willing and able to try and punish all criminal offenses which members of such forces may commit in the Belgian Congo.
The Belgian Government is correct in its assumption that the proposed arrangement is intended to cover only offenses of a criminal nature. Should experience indicate the necessity of special arrange-

ments concerning civil cases the matter will then be taken up with Payment of claims arising from acts of you. However, in connection with actions for damages on account of U. S. armed forces. injuries to persons or property by members of the armed forces of the
United States in the Belgian Congo it may be stated that the military authorities of the United States are empowered to set up military
claims commissions to consider such cases in foreign countries. Claims
in amounts up to $5,000 may be adjudicated and paid by the military authorities. Claims in excess of that amount may be recommended to Congress for payment by the Secretaries of War or Navy. Should the necessity be apparent such commissions will, no doubt, be provided for in the Belgian Congo.
Accept, Excellency, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration.

No. 101

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Ottawa, Canada, February 25, 1944.

SIR :

I have the honor to refer to your note No. 157 of December 10, 1943, [ ¹] concerning the desirability of having a study made by the International Joint Commission with respect to the Upper Columbia River Basin from the points of view of navigation , power development, irrigation, flood control , and other beneficial public uses and purposes.
As the result of informal exchanges of views on this subject I have been directed to bring the following suggested reference to the Commission to your attention with the request that I be informed whether it is acceptable to the Government of Canada :

"1. In order to determine whether a greater use than is now being made of the waters of the Columbia River system would be feasible and advantageous, the Governments of the United States and Canada have agreed to refer the matter to the International Joint Commission for investigation and report pursuant to Article IX of the Convention concerning Boundary Waters between the United States and Canada , signed January 11th , 1909.
"2. It is desired that the Commission shall determine whether
in its judgment further development of the water resources of the river basin would be practicable and in the public interest from the points of view of the two Governments, having in mind (A) domestic water supply and sanitation, ( B) navigation , (C) efficient development of water power, (D) the control of floods, (E ) the needs of irrigation , ( F ) reclamation of wet lands, (G) conservation of fish and wildlife, and ( H ) other beneficial public purposes.
"3. In the event that the Commission should find that further
works or projects would be feasible and desirable for one or more of the purposes indicated above, it should indicate how the interests on either side of the boundary would be benefited or adversely affected thereby, and should estimate the costs of such works or projects, including indemnification for damage to public and private property and the costs of any remedial works that
1 ¹ [Not printed. ]

Feb. 25, 1944 58 STAT. ] CANADA-UPPER COLUMBIA RIVER BASIN- Mar. 3, 1944
may be found to be necessary, and should indicate how the costs of any projects and the amounts of any resulting damage should
be apportioned between the two Governments. "4. The Commission should also investigate and report on exist-
ing dams, hydro-electric plants, navigation works , and other works or projects located within the Columbia River system in so far as such investigation and report may be germane to the subject under consideration.
"5. In the conduct of its investigation and otherwise in the performance of its duties under this reference, the Commission may utilize the services of engineers and other specially qualified personnel of the technical agencies of Canada and the United States and will so far as possible make use of information and technical data heretofore acquired by such technical agencies or which may become available during the course of the investigation , thus avoiding duplication of effort and unnecessary expense."

If the proposed reference is acceptable to your Government I should appreciate being informed , and this note together with your reply would be regarded as an agreement between our two Governments on the terms of reference.

Accept, Sir, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration.

Agreement between the United States of America and Canada respecting radio broadcasting stations . Effected by exchanges of notes signed at Ottawa November 5 and 25, 1943 and January 17, 1944.

LEGATION OF THE

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

Broadcasting stations in Northwest
Command.

DEAR MR. ROBERTSON :

Ottawa, November 5, 1943.

I understand that the Northwest Service Command, United States Army, feels a need for small broadcasting stations at several isolated garrisons in the Northwest Command. These stations would be sim-

ilar to those established at various posts in Alaska and in the United

Kingdom which are supplied with non -commercial entertainment pro-

gram material by the Special Service Division , Army Service Forces.

· Although there would be no aspect of competition with the Canadian

Broadcasting System due to the isolated locations, a special problem

has arisen in complying with Canadian laws and policies. As the

stations would be operated by military personnel under the direct con-

auPthroorpiozsaetdiond.raft of

trol of the local commanding officer, effective supervision of the operation could be exercised only through military channels. In order to ensure compliance with Canadian laws and to assure that the stations

would be operated in such a manner as to serve the local populace in

strict accordance with the desires of the appropriate Canadian author-

ities, a proposed draft of authorization which would be issued by the

Secretary of War if the Canadian Government were to approve the

proposal, is enclosed herewith. I have been directed to bring this matter to your attention with the request that the Canadian Government approve the installations as outlined in the enclosure hereto. At

the same time I have been directed to say that any stations placed in operation under the authority, if granted, would be closed at any time on the request of the Canadian Government and, in any event, upon

the removal of the garrison or the establishment of regular broadcasting facilities. In addition, the United States War Department has said that it would be immediately responsive to the desires of the Canadian Government in any questions arising out of the operation of the proposed stations.

I understand informally that this desire of the Northwest Service Command has been made known to you through Brigadier General

W. W. Foster, and that the War Committee of the Cabinet has approved it in principle. If there is any further information you desire in order to reach a final decision in this matter, I should appreciate

being informed. Yours sincerely,

LEWIS CLARK Charge d'Affaires ad interim

BRITISH EMBASSY, WASHINGTON, D. C. March 10th, 1944.

MR. SECRETARY OF STATE,

The attention of His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for

55 Stat. 732. 17 U. 8. C., Supp. III, § 8.

Foreign Affairs has been invited to the Act of Congress of the United States of America approved 25th September, 1941 , which provides for extending, on a reciprocal basis, the time for the fulfilment of

the conditions and formalities prescribed by the copyright laws of

the United States in the case of authors or proprietors of works first

produced or published abroad who are temporarily unable to comply with those conditions and formalities because of the disruption or

suspension of the facilities essential for their compliance.

By direction of Mr. Eden, I write to inform you that, by reason of

the existing emergency, British authors and copyright proprietors of certain of His Majesty's dominions, colonies and possessions and citizens of Palestine (excluding Trans-Jordan ) do at present lack,

and since the outbreak of the war between the United Kingdom and Germany on September 3rd, 1939, have lacked the facilities essential to compliance with and to the fulfilment of the conditions and

formalities established by the laws of the United States relating to copyright .

It is the desire of His Majesty's Government in the United King-

dom that, in accordance with the procedure provided in the said Act

of September 25th , 1941 , the time for fulfilling the conditions and

formalities of the copyright laws of the United States be extended for the benefit of ( 1 ) British nationals of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of the British territories

named in the annexed list, and ( 2 ) citizens of Palestine ( excluding Trans-Jordan ) , whose works are eligible to copyright in the United States.

With a view to assuring the Government of the United States of

America of reciprocal protection for authors and proprietors of the

United States, His Majesty the King has made an Order in Council, the text of which is annexed hereto, which will come into effect from

the date on which the President of the United States shall proclaim,

in accordance with the said Act of September 25th, 1941 that by reason of the existing emergency, British nationals of the United

58 STAT. ] GREAT BRITAIN-COPYRIGHT EXTENSION- MAR. 10, 1944

Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of the British territories named in the annexed list, and citizens of Palestine (excluding Trans-Jordan ) , who are authors or copyright owners of works first produced or published outside the United States and now subject to copyright, ad interim copyright or renewal of copyright under the laws of the United States, are at present and since the outbreak of war between the United Kingdom and Germany on September 3rd , 1939, have been temporarily unable to comply with the conditions and formalities prescribed with respect to such works by the copyright laws of the United States.

His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom are prepared if

this proposal is acceptable to the Government of the United States of

America, to regard the present note and Your Excellency's reply to

the same effect as constituting an agreement between the two Gov-

ernments, which shall take effect this day.

Lord President Lord Macmillan

Secretary Sir Archibald Sinclair Mr. Williams.

Whereas by reason of conditions arising out of the war difficulties have been experienced by citizens of the United States of America in complying with the requirements of the Copyright Act, 1911 ( a) , as to first publication within the parts of His Majesty's dominions to which the Act extends of their works first published in the United States of America during the war :
And whereas His Majesty is advised that the Government of the United States of America has undertaken to grant such extension of time as may be deemed appropriate for the fulfilment of the conditions and formalities prescribed by the laws of the United States with respect to the works of British subjects first produced or published outside the United States and subject to copyright or to renewal of copyright under the laws of the United States including works subject to ad interim copyright :
And whereas by reason of the said undertaking of the Government of the United States of America His Majesty is satisfied that the said Government has made, or has undertaken to make, such provision as it is expedient to require for the protection of works first made or
(a) 1 & 2 Geo. 5. c. 46.

published during the period commencing on the 3rd day of September, 1939, and ending one year after the termination of the present war within the parts of His Majesty's dominions to which this Order applies and entitles to copyright under Part I of the Copyright Act, 1911 :
And whereas by the Copyright Act, 1911 , authority is conferred upon His Majesty to extend, by Order in Council, the protection of the said Act to certain classes of foreign works within any part of His Majesty's dominions, other than the self-governing Dominions , to which the Act extends :
And whereas by reason of these premises it is desirable to provide protection within the parts of His Majesty's dominions to which this Order applies for literary or artistic works first published in the United States of America during the period commencing on the 3rd day of September, 1939, and ending one year after the termination of the present war which have failed to accomplish the formalities prescribed by the Copyright Act, 1911, by reason of conditions arising out of the war :
Now, therefore, His Majesty, by and with the advice of His Privy Council, and by virtue of the authority conferred upon Him by the Copyright Act, 1911, and of all other powers enabling Him in that behalf, is pleased to direct and doth hereby direct as follows :-
1. The Copyright Act, 1911, shall, subject to the provisions of the said Act and of this Order, apply to works first published in the United States of America during the period commencing on the 3rd day of September, 1939, and ending one year after the termination of the present war, which have not been republished in the parts of His Majesty's dominions to which this Order applies within fourteen days of the publication in the United States of America, in like manner as if they had been first published within the parts of His Majesty's dominions to which the said Act extends :
Provided that the enjoyment by any such work of the rights conferred by the Copyright Act, 1911, shall be conditional upon publication of the work within the parts of His Majesty's dominions to which this Order relates not later than one year after the termination of the present war, and shall commence from and after such publication, which shall not be colourable only, but shall be intended to satisfy the reasonable requirements of the public.
2. The provisions of Section 15 of the Copyright Act, 1911 , as to the delivery of books to libraries, shall apply to works to which this Order relates upon their publication in the United Kingdom .
3. Nothing in this Order shall be construed as depriving any work of any rights which have been lawfully acquired under the provisions of the Copyright Act, 1911 , or any Order in Council thereunder.
4. Where any person has, before the commencement of this Order taken any action whereby he has incurred any expenditure or liability in connection with the reproduction or performance of any work which at the time was lawful, or for the purpose of or with a view to the reproduction or performance of a work at a time when such reproduc-

tion or performance would, but for the making of this Order , have been lawful, nothing in this Order shall diminish or prejudice any rights or interest arising from or in connexion with such action which were subsisting and valuable at the said date, unless the person who by virtue of this Order becomes entitled to restrain such reproduction or performance agrees to pay such compensation as, failing agreement, may be determined by arbitration.
5. The Interpretation Act, 1889 ( a ) , shall apply to the interpretation of this Order as if it were an Act of Parliament.
6. This Order may be cited as the Copyright (United States of America) Order, 1942.
7. This Order shall come into operation on the date of its publication in the London Gazette, which day is in this Order referred to as the commencement of this Order.

In reply to Your Excellency's note dated February 18, 1944 referring to the renewal of the Agreement signed by the Governments of Peru and the United States of America on July 31 , 1940 providing for the assignment of a United States Naval Aviation Mission to Peru, I am pleased to inform Your Excellency that the Peruvian Government has taken note that this renewal is agreeable to the United States Government and that it agrees to include the additional article suggested in Your Excellency's note with the following ammendment : "during the present war emergency". In consequence the said article would read as thus :

"The members of this Mission are permitted and may be authorized to represent the United States of America on any commission and in any other capacity having to do with military cooperation or hemispheric defense without prejudice to this Agreement, during the present war emergency".
The Peruvian Government also suggests that the period of the said Mission would be for two years instead of four years from the date of the signing of the Agreement and that the following wording would

58 STAT. ] PERU-NAVAL AVIATION MISSION- Jan. 31, Feb. 18, 1944 Apr. 6, 29, May 2 , 1944
be added to Article II of the Agreement : "Any member of the Mission may be recalled by the Government of the United States after the expiration of two years of service during peace time and at any moment during war time. In which case another member shall be furnished to replace him". According to a recent act approved by the Congress of Peru the Ministry of Aeronautics has been established and it will be appreciated if the title of Ministry of Marine and Aviation be changed to Ministry of Aeronautics in every instance that it appears in the Agreement.
Please accept, Your Excellency, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration.
EDUARDO GARLAND.
His Excellency, CORDELL HULL, Secretary of State.

SIR :
Reference is made to your note of April 6 , 1944 concerning the renewal of the Agreement entered into on July 31, 1940 between the Governments of the United States of America and the Republic of Peru, providing for the assignment of a United States Naval Aviation Mission to Peru.
I note that the proposed additional article to the basic Agreement , as set forth in my note of February 18, 1944, is acceptable to your Government provided it is amended by adding the following words "during the present war emergency". It is also noted that the Government of Peru desires that the Agreement be extended only for a period of two years and that the following language be added to Title I Article 2 of the basic Agreement :

54 Stat. 2355.

"Any member of the Mission may be recalled by the Government of the United States after the expiration of two years of service during peace time and at any moment during war time, in which case another member shall be furnished to replace him."

It is inferred, and is the understanding of this Government, that

the Peruvian Government's request contemplates also that in the same

way the title "Minister of Marine and Aviation " shall be changed to "Minister of Aeronautics".

I am pleased to inform you that the proposed changes are accept- U. 8. acceptance of proposed changes.
able to this Government with the exception of the proposed addition to Exception.

Title I Article 2 , which the Navy Department is of the opinion is already covered by Title IV Article 17 of the basic Agreement.

EXCELLENCY:

I have the honor to refer to recent conversations held in Washing-

ton between the Special Representative of the Dominican Government, Sr. Manuel de Moya, and representatives of the interested agencies of my government, regarding the purchase by the Government of the United States of the exportable surpluses of a number of Dominican food products.
I enclose herewith a "Memorandum of Understanding" dated November 1 , 1943 containing a statement of the agreements which were arrived at as a result of the above-mentioned conversations.

For purposes of clarification , I am instructed to point out it is the understanding of my Government that paragraph 8 (a) of the Memorandum means that the Commodity Credit Corporation or its nominee is guaranteed the entire exportable surplus of live cattle and that no frozen or prepared beef may be exported in any month until the Commodity Credit Corporation or its nominee has received in that month 1000 head in live form. If the Dominican Government con-

curs in this understanding, I should appreciate confirmation of such concurrence .

I also desire to invite Your Excellency's attention to paragraph

number 3 of the " Memorandum of Understanding ", which provides that, upon the exchange of notes, adequate publicity to the contents

thereof will be given simultaneously in the United States and in the

Dominican Republic. I should therefore appreciate information

from Your Excellency at the time of exchange of notes as to the manner of the proposed announcement of the Dominican Govern-

ment and the date on which its announcement will be made . This

information is desired in order that public announcement may be made

simultaneously in the United States and the Dominican Republic.

SEÑOR EMBAJADOR:

Tengo la honra de acusar recibo de la atenta nota de fecha 17 de diciembre de 1943 , por la cual Vuestra Excelencia se sirve referirse a

las conversaciones sostenidas en Washington entre el Representante

Especial del Gobierno Dominicano, Señor Manuel de Moya, de una parte, y los Representantes de los organismos interesados del Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de América, de otra parte, sobre la compra por

1280

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [58 STAT.
Vuestro Gobierno de los excedentes exportables de determinados productos alimenticios .
Adjunto a la citada nota Vuestra Excelencia se sirve remitir un "Memorandum de Acuerdo " que contiene las estipulaciones que fueron fijadas como resultado de las referidas conversaciones, cuyo texto dice así:
"1.- El día 10 de septiembre, 1943 , se entregó al señor Manuel de Moya en Santiago , R. D. , un memorandum preparado por los señores Samuel Herman, de la Foreign Economic Administration ; Robert J. McArdle, de la Commodity Credit Corporation y Don Catlett , de la Embajada Americana en la República Dominicana, para ser sometido al Presidente de la República . Señalaba este memorandum el interés que tenía la Commodity Credit Corporation de entrar en negociaciones con el Gobierno Dominicano para la compra, para exportación , de los excedentes exportables de ciertos productos agrícolas dominicanos , indicados , hasta el primero de julio de 1945. Por consiguiente , el Presidente Trujillo designó al señor de Moya para concertar las referidas negociaciones en nombre de la República Dominicana . Las negociaciones tuvieron lugar en Washington, D. C. , el 27 de septiembre de 1943 .
"2.- Este memorandum de Acuerdo sintetiza lo que se ha convenido en las negociaciones de Washington. Está firmado oficialmente por el señor de Moya en nombre de la República Dominicana y por los funcionarios competentes respectivos a nombre de la Foreign Economic Administration , del Departamento de Estado y de la Commodity Credit Corporation. Los acuerdos aquí referidos serán incorporados en las notas que deben ser canjeadas, tan pronto sea posible, entre el Gobierno de los Estados Unidos y el Gobierno de la República Dominicana en Ciudad Trujillo , R. D.
"3. - Después del canje de dichas notas, se dará publicidad apropiada a su contenido , simultáneamente , en los Estados Unidos y en la República Dominicana.
"4.- El 10 de junio , 1943 , la Cancillería Dominicana trasmitió su nota No. 11549 , aceptando el memorandum de Acuerdo del 20 de mayo de 1943 , por el cual la República Dominicana se comprometía a vender a la Commodity Credit Corporation todos sus excedentes exportables de arroz , maíz y tortas (harina) de maní hasta el primero de julio de 1945. En cuanto a ese Acuerdo , se entiende también que :
a) Como la Commodity Credit Corporation es el comprador exclusivo para la exportación de los citados productos, el Gobierno Dominicano no exigirá permisos de exportación a los traficantes dominicanos que vendan a la Commodity Credit Corporation .
b) En las notas que serán canjeadas se estipulará una "tarifa" detallada o componentes de los precios que la Commodity Credit Corporation pagará por el arroz y el maíz , estipulándose específicamente el precio que se pagará a los campesinos o productores . Cada tarifa será promulgada oficialmente en la República Dominicana y será publicada en toda la República por el Secretario de Estado de Agricultura, En cuanto al maiz , esto no afecta el compromiso contraído

el 10 de septiembre por el señor de Moya de gestionar la inmediata publicación por el Secretario de Estado de Agricultura , de la tarifa de maiz adoptada en Santiago .

e) En cuanto al arroz, la Commodity Credit Corporation o su representante, comprará de los exportadores calificados de acuerdo con la legislación aplicable del Gobierno Dominicano . Esto no impedirá que la Commodity Credit Corporation y el Gobierno de la República Dominicana discutan entre sí otro procedimiento de compra en caso de que el método convenido resulte inadecuado o inconveniente .
"5. - La Commodity Credit Corporation, o su apoderado, se compromete a comprar, hasta Julio 1 , 1945 , la totalidad del excedente exportable de maní descascarado, producido en la República Dominicana, sobre la base siguiente: La Commodity Credit Corporation pagará $ 6.75, moneda corriente de los Estados Unidos , por 100 libras de maní descascarado f.a.s.

El Acuerdo estará en vigor hasta el 30 de Junio de 1945.

February 11 , 1944.

MR. AMBASSADOR :

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your courteous note

of December 17, 1943 , in which Your Excellency refers to the conversations carried on in Washington between the special representative of the Dominican Government, Mr. Manuel de Moya, on the one hand , and the representatives of interested agencies of the Government of the United States of America, on the other, regarding the purchase

by your Government of the exportable surpluses of certain food

products .

Attached to the above-mentioned note Your Excellency transmits a

"Memorandum of Understanding" containing the stipulations which

were arrived at as a result of the conversations referred to , the text of which reads thus:

[For the English version of the memorandum of understanding of Nov. 1 , 1943 , see ante, p. 1274.]
In response to said note, I have the honor to inform Your Excellency that the Dominican Government accepts in their entirety the

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [ 58 STAT.

stipulations set forth as constituting the agreement concluded between the two Governments for the sale of the exportable surpluses of Dominican food products to which the said stipulations refer in a limitative manner.
In relation to paragraph 8 (a) of the memorandum of understanding, my Government desires to explain that the entire exportable surplus of live cattle is guaranteed to the Commodity Credit Corporation or its nominee, and that in no month may there be exported frozen or prepared meats until the Commodity Credit Corporation or its nominee shall have received in that month the stipulated 1,000 head of cattle.

Therefore, my Government understands that any number of cattle

existing as a surplus after the consumption needs of the Dominican

Republic are satisfied will be sold to the Commodity Credit Corpora-

tion or its nominee , even though this number may not reach 1,000

head , in the understanding that only after arriving at that number

will it be possible to export frozen or prepared meats. In accordance with paragraph 4 (b) and paragraph 17 of the agree-

ment with which this note deals, the detailed tarifa of schedule of prices which will be paid by the Commodity Credit Corporation,

and which stipulates also the price which will be paid to the farmers or producers, is as follows:

Price for the producer:

Dec. 17, 1943 58 STAT. ] DOMINICAN REPUBLIC-FOOD SURPLUSES-
Feb. 11, 1944
to make public , simultaneously with the Government of the United States of America, a press release in both countries, with the following text:
"Conclusion of an agreement which stipulates the sale of the entire exportable surplus of several Dominican foodstuffs exclusively to the Government of the United States, through the Foreign Economic Administration, in order to check the shortage of food in the Caribbean and other areas was announced today jointly by the Dominican Government and the Department of State of the United States . The agreement shall be in force until June 30, 1945.
"The cooperative efforts of the Government of the Dominican Republic and of its food producers have resulted in an increase in production in these critical times and constitute an important contribution to the total United Nations food-supply program and a contribution to the total available supplies which will be distributed in areas affected by the shortage . It will be of appreciable importance to Puerto Rico and other Caribbean islands which now depend to a great extent on exports of food from the United States .
"Direct shipments of Dominican foods to these islands represent an economy in shipping. The Dominican Government is contributing substantially in this respect by providing a fleet of vessels for interisland transportation of foodstuffs .
"In conformity with an agreement signed previously, the Dominican Republic is selling to the United States exclusively its surpluses of corn, rice, and peanut cakes, for use in the Caribbean areas. The new agreement adds the items of peanuts, red kidney beans , and live cattle. Moreover, a refusal is granted to the United States for purchases of butter, eggs, fresh vegetables , and fruits."
My Government proposes to release the above for publication in the morning newspapers of Friday, February 18, 1944.
I avail myself of this opportunity to reiterate to Your Excellency the assurances of my highest consideration .

Agreement between the United States of America and Canada respecting payment for certain defense installations. Effected by exchange of notes signed at Washington June 23 and 27, 1944.

57 Stat. 1429.

The Canadian Ambassador to the Secretary of State

CANADIAN EMBASSY AMBASSADE DU CANADA

No. 238

WASHINGTON, D. C. June 23, 1944.

SIR, I have the honour to refer to the exchange of notes between the
Governments of Canada and the United States dated January 27 , 1943, regarding the post-war disposition of defence projects and installations constructed in Canada by the Government of the United States. These notes approved the 28th Recommendation of the Permanent Joint Board on Defence, which said in part :

"The Board considered the question of the post- war disposition of the defence projects and installations which the Government of the United States has built or may build in Canada. The Board noted that the two Governments have already reached specific agreements for the post-war disposition of most of the projects and installations thus far undertaken. It considers that such agreements are desirable and should be made whenever possible.
"The Board recommends the approval of the following formula as a generally fair and equitable basis to be used by reference whenever appropriate in the making of agreements in the future and to cover such defence projects, if any, the post- war disposition of which has not previously been specifically provided for :
"A: All immovable defence installations built or provided in Canada by the Government of the United States shall within one year after the cessation of hostilities, unless otherwise agreed by the two Governments, be relinquished to the Crown either in the right of Canada or in the right of the province in which the same or any part thereof lies, as may be appropriate under Canadian law."

2. As hereinafter explained , the two governments have agreed
that special arrangements should be made relating to permanent United States air installations in Canada and to the telephone line
from Edmonton to the Alaska boundary built by the United States Government.

58 STAT. ] CANADA-DEFENSE INSTALLATIONS -JUNE 23, 27, 1944

3. In note no. 643 of December 18 , 1943, I informed you that the Canadian Government "will not accept payment from the United States Government for the construction of any permanent facilities or improvements made by the Canadian Government on United States Government account on airfields in Northwest Canada, and will make payment to the United States Government for all construction of a permanent nature carried out by the United States Government on air routes in this area."
4. It was subsequently agreed between the two Governments that, in addition, the Canadian Government should assume the cost of permanent air installations elsewhere in Canada and at Goose Bay (Labrador ) built by or on the account of the United States Government, the cost of the telephone line from Edmonton to the Alaska boundary built by the United States Government, and the cost of the proposed improvement program on the Northwest Staging Route.
5. Discussions have recently taken place between representatives of the two Governments regarding the details of the decisions and arrangements referred to in the two preceding paragraphs, with a view to listing the installations involved and their costs, and to settling the exact amount of money to be paid by the Canadian Government to the United States Government.
6. It is my understanding that the following has been agreed as a result of these discussions. The Canadian Government will pay to the United States Government the following amounts in United States dollars for construction carried out by the United States Government :

Northwest Staging Route ( including contracts not yet com-

pleted ) Flight strips along the Alaska Highway Flight strips along the Mackenzie River

$31, 311, 196 3,262, 687 1,264, 150

Airfield at Goose Bay, Labrador

543, 000

Telephone line from Edmonton to Alaska boundary

9, 342, 208

TOTAL

76, 811, 551

7. The details of the costs of construction are shown in the attached appendices marked "I", "II" and "III ", [ ¹ ] which have been prepared by the United States War Department. The appendices show that costs of $90,683,571 were actually incurred by the United States Government in construction but $ 13,872,020 of this amount was for installations which, although of value to joint defence during the war, have no permanent value. It has been agreed that the Canadian Government should pay that part of United States construction costs which represents installations having a permanent value, namely $76,811,551 .

8. The costs incurred by the Canadian Government on United States Government account which the Canadian Government will assume pursuant to the decisions reached are as follows :

Northwest Staging Route Northeast Canada Airfield at Goose Bay, Labrador

$18, 359, 953 1, 290, 010 9,950, 000

TOTAL

$29, 599, 963

In addition the Canadian Government will pay $ 5,161,000 for the projected improvement program on the Northwest Staging Route. Details of the four items mentioned in this paragraph are given in the attached appendix marked "IV". [ ¹]
9. It is understood that all the items mentioned in the four appendices, whether or not of permanent value, will be relinquished to the Canadian Government pursuant to the Exchange of Notes of January 27, 1943, hereinbefore referred to. However, such relinquishment does not affect existing arrangements for the maintenance , operation and defence of these facilities for the duration of the war. In this connec-
tion, it is relevant to quote the following extract from the Journal of the meeting of the Permanent Joint Board on Defence held April 12-13, 1944 :

"In noting this decision of the two Governments, (i. e. the decision of the Canadian Government to assume the costs of the
installations) , the Board observed that it relates only to the financial aspect of the facilities in question and has no bearing on existing arrangements for the maintenance, operation and defence of the facilities for the duration of the war. It is the Board's
understanding that the existing arrangements will remain in effect for the duration of the emergency as previously agreed upon unless modified by mutual agreement between the two Governments."

10. If the foregoing is acceptable to the Government of the United States, this note and your reply thereto shall be regarded as placing on record the understanding arrived at between our Governments.
Accept, Sir, the renewed assurance of my highest consideration. LEIGHTON MCCARTHY

APRIL 14, 1944

EXCELLENCY : I have the honor to refer to the trade agreement between the
Republic of Turkey and the United States of America signed at Ankara, April 1 , 1939 , Article I of which reads as follows :

"Natural or manufactured products originating in the United States of America, enumerated and described in Schedule I annexed to this Agreement, shall, on their importation into the territory of the Turkish Republic, be accorded the tariff reductions provided for in the said Schedule.
"In the event that the Government of the Turkish Republic should increase the duties provided for in the said Schedule , such increased duties shall not be applied to the said products until two months after the date of their promulgation.
"If before the expiration of the aforesaid period of two months an agreement between the two Governments has not been reached
with respect to such compensatory modifications of this Agreement as may be deemed appropriate, the Government of the United States of America shall be free within fifteen days after the date of the application of such increased duties to terminate this Agreement in its entirety on thirty days' written notice. "
The duty on heavy mineral oils, Turkish tariff no. 695 D, and their residues, comprising machine oil , mazout , motorine, and other such combustibles, as provided in Schedule I of the trade agreement, is 0.95 piastre per kilo, while the duty on kerosene, tariff no. 695 C, is 6 piastres per kilo.
During recent years the quality of motorine has been greatly improved so as to make it desirable to apply the same duties to motorine as to kerosene. To raise the duty on motorine to the level existing for kerosene would necessitate raising the price of motorine to such height as would cause harmful repercussions. Therefore, in accordance with the terms of Article I of the trade agreement, the Turkish Government contemplates reducing the duty on tariff no. 695 C to 3.30 piastres per kilo while raising that on tariff no. 695 D to 2.75 piastres per kilo (which with the existing excise tax on motorine of 0.55 piastre per kilo would amount to 3.30 piastres per kilo.)

In view of the circumstances described in Your Excellency's note I have the honor to reply that the Government of the United States does not object to the above-mentioned duty changes.

The Secretary of State to the Colombian Ambassador

DEPARTMENT OF STATE WASHINGTON January 27, 1944

EXCELLENCY :

I have the honor to refer to conversations which have taken place

between officers of the Colombian Embassy and of the Department of

54 Stat. 885. 50 U. 8. C. app.
§$§$ 330021--331158.; Supp. III, Ante, pp. 720, 798.

State with respect to the application of the United States Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, as amended, to Colombian nationals residing in the United States.
As you are aware, the Act provides that with certain exceptions every male citizen of the United States and every other male person between the ages of eighteen and sixty-five residing in the United States shall register. The Act further provides that, with certain exceptions, registrants within specified age limits are liable for active military service in the United States armed forces.

This Government recognizes that from the standpoint of morale

of the individuals concerned and the over-all military effort of the

countries at war with the Axis Powers, it is desirable to permit certain

nationals of cobelligerent countries who have registered or who may

register under the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, as

amended, to enlist in the armed forces of their own country, should

they desire to do so. It will be recalled that during the World War this Government signed conventions with certain associated powers on

this subject. The United States Government believes, however, that

under existing circumstances the same ends may now be accomplished

through administrative action, thus obviating the delays incident to

the signing and ratification of conventions.

Nationals of cobelligerent countries.

This Government has, therefore, initiated a procedure permitting

ceIdnurdeu. ction pro- aliens who have registered under the Selective Training and Service

Act of 1940, as amended, who are nationals of certain cobelligerent countries and who have not declared their intention of becoming

American citizens to elect to serve in the forces of their respective

countries, in lieu of service in the armed forces of the United States,

at any time prior to their induction into the armed forces of this coun-

try. This Government is also affording to such nationals, who may

already be serving in the armed forces of the United States, an op-

portunity of electing to transfer to the armed forces of their own

1297

country. The details of the procedure are arranged directly between

the War Department and the Selective Service System on the part of the United States Government and the appropriate authorities of

the cobelligerent government concerned. It should be understood ,

however, that in all cases a person exercising an option under the pro-

cedure must actually be accepted by the military authorities of the country of his allegiance before his departure from the United States.
Before the above-mentioned procedure is made effective with respect to a cobelligerent country, this Department wishes to receive from the

Stipulations to be agreed to by cobellig-
erent country.

diplomatic representative in Washington of that country a note stating

that his government desires to avail itself of the procedure and in so

doing agrees that :

(a) No threat or cumpulsion of any nature will be exercised by his government to induce any person in the United States to enlist in the forces of his or any foreign government ;
(b) Reciprocal treatment will be granted to American citizens by his government ; that is, prior to induction in the armed forces of his government they will be granted the opportunity of electing to serve in the armed forces of the United States in substantially the same manner as outlined above . Furthermore, his government shall agree to inform all American citizens serving in its armed forces or former American citizens who may have lost their citizenship as a result of having taken an oath of allegiance on enlistment in such armed forces and who are now serving in
those forces that they may transfer to the armed forces of the United States provided they desire to do so and provided they are acceptable to the armed forces of the United States. The arrangements for effecting such transfers are to be worked out by the appropriate representatives of the armed forces of the respective governments ;
(c) No enlistments will be accepted in the United States by his government of American citizens subject to registration or of aliens of any nationality who have declared their intention of becoming American citizens and are subject to registration.

This Government is prepared to make the proposed regime effective immediately with respect to Colombia upon the receipt from you of a note stating that your Government desires to participate in it and agrees to the stipulations set forth in lettered paragraphs ( a) , (b) , and (c) above.
Accept, Excellency, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration .

Agreement and supplementary exchange of notes between the United States of America and Iran respecting reciprocal trade. Signed at Washington April 8, 1943; proclaimed by the President of the United States of America March 31, 1944; ratified by the National Assembly (Majlis) of Iran October 24, 1943; proclamation and instrument of ratification exchanged at Washington May 29, 1944 ; supplementary proclamation by the President of the United States of America May 29, 1944; effective June 28, 1944.
BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
A PROCLAMATION

WHEREAS Section 350 ( a ) of the Tariff Act of 1930 of the Congress of the United States of America, as amended by the act of June 12 , 1934, entitled "AN ACT To amend the Tariff Act of 1930" (48 Stat. II1I,9§U1.3581.(aC).., Supp. 943 ; U.S.C. , 1940 ed. , title 19 , sec. 1351 ( a ) ) , provided as follows :
"Sec. 350. ( a) For the purpose of expanding foreign markets for the products of the United States ( as a means of assisting in the present emergency in restoring the American standard of living, in overcoming domestic unemployment and the present economic depression , in increasing the purchasing power of the American public, and in establishing and maintaining a better relationship among various branches of American agriculture, industry, mining, and commerce) by regulating the admission of foreign goods into the United States in accordance with the characteristics and needs of various branches of American production so that foreign markets will be made available to those branches of American production which require and are capable of developing such outlets by affording corresponding market opportunities for foreign products in the United States, the President, whenever he finds as a fact that any existing duties or other import restrictions of the United States or any foreign country are unduly burdening and restricting the foreign trade of the United States and that the purpose above declared will be promoted by the means hereinafter specified, is authorized from time to time-
"(1) To enter into foreign trade agreements with foreign governments or instrumentalities thereof ; and
"(2) to proclaim such modifications of existing duties and other import restrictions, or such additional import restrictions, or such continuance, and for such minimum periods, of existing customs or excise treatment of any article covered by foreign trade agreements, as are required or appropriate to carry out any foreign trade agreement that the President has entered into hereunder . No proclamation shall be made increasing or decreasing by more than 50 per centum any existing rate of duty or transferring any article between the dutiable and free lists. The proclaimed duties and other import restrictions shall apply to articles

58 STAT. ]

IRAN- RECIPROCAL TRADE-APR. 8, 1943

the growth, produce, or manufacture of all foreign countries, whether imported directly, or indirectly : Provided, That the President may suspend the application to articles the growth, produce, or manufacture of any country because of its discriminatory treatment of American commerce or because of other acts or policies which in his opinion tend to defeat the purposes set forth in this section ; and the proclaimed duties and other import restrictions shall be in effect from and after such time as is specified in the proclamation. The President may at any time terminate any such proclamation in whole or in part."

WHEREAS the period within which the President of the United States of America was authorized to enter into trade agreements under the

said section 350 ( a ) was extended by joint resolutions of Congress approved March 1, 1937 and April 12 , 1940 ( 48 Stat. 944 ; 50 Stat. 24 ; 54 Stat. 107 ; U.S.C. , 1940 ed., title 19, sec. 1352 (c) ) ;
WHEREAS I , Franklin D. Roosevelt, President of the United States

19 U. S. C., Supp. III, § 1352 (c) .

of America, have found as a fact that certain existing duties and other import restrictions of the United States of America and Iran are

unduly burdening and restricting the foreign trade of the United States of America and that the purpose declared in the above-quoted

provisions of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended , will be promoted by a trade agreement between the United States of America and Iran ;

WHEREAS reasonable public notice of the intention to negotiate such trade agreement was given and the views presented by persons

interested in the negotiation of such agreement were received and considered ;
WHEREAS, after seeking and obtaining information and advice with respect thereto from the United States Tariff Commission, the Departments of State, Agriculture , and Commerce, and from other sources, I entered into a trade agreement on April 8, 1943, through my duly empowered Plenipotentiary, with His Imperial Majesty the Shah-inShah of Iran, through his duly empowered Plenipotentiary, which agreement, including two schedules annexed thereto , in the English and Persian languages, is in words and figures as follows :
The President of the United States of America and His Imperial

Purposes declared .

Majesty the Shah-in- Shah of Iran , being desirous of strengthening the traditional bonds of friendship between the two countries by main-

taining as heretofore the principle of equality of treatment as the basis of commercial relations and by granting mutual and reciprocal concessions and advantages for the promotion and extension of trade, have decided to conclude a Trade Agreement and for that purpose

have appointed their Plenipotentiaries, as follows : The President of the United States of America :

Cordell Hull, Secretary of State of the United States of America ; and

His Imperial Majesty the Shah-in- Shah of Iran : Mohammed Shayesteh, Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at Washington ;

who, after communicating to each other their respective full powers, found to be in good and due form, have agreed upon the following Articles :
ARTICLE I

Most-favored -nation treatment.

1. The United States of America and Iran will grant each other

unconditional and unrestricted most-favored-nation treatment in all

matters concerning customs duties and subsidiary charges of every kind and in the method of levying duties, and, further, in all matters concerning the rules, formalities and charges imposed in connection with the clearing of goods through the customs, and with respect to all laws or regulations affecting the sale , taxation or use of imported

goods within the country. 2. Accordingly, articles the growth , produce or manufacture of
either country imported into the other shall in no case be subject, in regard to the matters referred to above, to any duties, taxes or charges other or higher, or to any rules or formalities other or more burden-

some, than those to which the like articles the growth , produce or

"IMPERIAL LEGATION OF IRAN "WASHINGTON, D. C.

"SIR :

"APRIL 8, 1943 "No. 108

"During the course of the negotiations of the Trade Agreement signed this day, and with direct reference to the tariff concession on opium imported into the United States as provided in Schedule II thereof, it has been explained that the general policy of the Government of the United States is to issue permits for the importation of opium only in cases where the producing country has established a system of import permits and export authorizations at least equivalent to that described in the International Opium Convention signed at Geneva on February 19 , 1925.
"It has been further explained that in accordance with this policy, which is of general application, the issuance of permits for the importation of Iranian opium into the United States in the future would depend largely upon the measures which may have been taken by the Government of Iran for controlling effectively traffic in opium.
"I am directed by my Government to state that it fully appreciates the reasons which have led to the general policy of the Government of the United States with respect to the importation of opium and to the adoption of the above means to carry out this policy. I am further directed to state that my Government has always been in full accord and sympathy with the international efforts made in the past to suppress the contraband traffic in opium, and that it is my Government's intention to establish

at an early date any additional regulations which may be necessary to confine the trade in opium produced in Iran to legitimate international channels, including a system of import permits and export authorizations at least equivalent to that described in the

Geneva drug convention of 1925. "Accept, Sir, the renewed assurances of my highest considera-

as party to contract.

The Department has now been advised that in order for the Navy

Department to act as procurement agency for the projected port devel-

Please be good enough to inform me whether the Liberian Govern-

ment will have any objection to signing a three party construction contract between the Liberian Government, the Navy Department , and the contractor.
If the Liberian Government's reply is favorable, a draft of a new contract will be forwarded for consideration by the Liberian Government.

In this connection , an exchange of notes between the Liberian Gov-

ernment and the Legation in the foregoing sense would be regarded by the Department as a satisfactory amendment to the Port Agreement.

Please accept, Excellency, the renewed assurance of my high consideration .

The Secretary of State to the Canadian Minister

DEPARTMENT OF STATE

WASHINGTON December 8, 1942

SIR :

I have the honor to refer to the conversation on August 12, 1942

between Mr. Merchant M. Mahoney, Counselor of the Canadian Lega-

tion, and an officer of the Department when Mr. Mahoney left an in-

formal memorandum dated August 10, 1942 [ 1] in which it is stated

that the terms of the Department's note dated May 7, 1942 [ ¹ ] and the

proposed provisional fur seal agreement between the United States and

Canada contained therein are generally acceptable to the Canadian

authorities but that the Canadian Department of Fisheries desires

an interpretation of certain specific points. The first of the points on which an interpretation is desired relates
to the basis for the suggestion made by this Government that the

Increase in Canadian share of skins.

Canadian share of the fur sealskins taken annually on the Pribilof

Islands be increased to 20 percent by adding to the 15 percent hereto-

fore received by Canada under the fur seal convention concluded on July 7, 1911 between the United States, Great Britain , Japan, and Russia, a part of the share formerly received by Japan under that

37 Stat. 1542.

convention. With regard to this I am pleased to say that, in accord-

ance with conversations between representatives of our two Govern-

ments, this Government's proposal that the Canadian share of the fur sealskins be increased to 20 percent is in recognition of the principles

underlying the fur seal convention of July 7 , 1911 , and the cooperation of the Canadian Government in scientific arrangements for the con-

servation of the fur seal herd. This figure is calculated with reference

to the pro rata share heretofore received by Canada and to Canada's established interest in the fur seal resources, and is intended to be pro-

visional only for the purposes of the present agreement. With reference to the second point mentioned in the Legation's
memorandum, I have to say that no objection is perceived to the

the fourth point in the Legation's memorandum, that the agreement shall be retroactive for the 1942 season ; also that it shall remain in effect for twelve months after the end of the present emergency unless

Government of an intention of terminating the agreement. With particular reference to the text of the proposed agreement it
is understood, from conversations between representatives of our two

Governments, that as far as practicable the provisions of the fur seal

convention of July 7, 1911 should be incorporated in the agreement

together with the following principal changes and additions :

(1 ) An increase in the Canadian share of the fur sealskins

taken annually on the Pribilof Islands from 15 percent to 20 percent.
(2 ) A provision in the agreement for pelagic sealing under emergency circumstances. It is the view of the Government of

the United States that the details regarding the conditions under which pelagic sealing might be conducted and the sharing of the sealskins taken by pelagic sealing should be the subject of consultation between the two Governments in the event circum-

stances indicate that pelagic sealing should be resorted to in order

to utilize effectively the fur seal herd.

(3 ) A provision permitting the issuance of permits for the

taking of fur seals for purposes of scientific research and the ex-

change of information obtained by such research.

(4) A provision that the two Governments consult from time

to time regarding the level of population at which the seal herd is to be maintained or other important phases of management

The American Minister to the Australian Minister of State for External Affairs

SIR :

LEGATION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
Canberra, A.C.T. November 10, 1942.

I have the honor to refer to my note of February 19, 1942 [ ¹ ] and to the reply of May 29 [ 1 ] of the then Acting Minister for External

Affairs, the Right Honorable John Curtin, relating to the question of changing the present procedure with respect to prizes taken by the United States naval forces in foreign waters remote from ports of the United States.

I am now in receipt of instructions from the Department of State

56 Stat. 746. 50 U. S. C. Supp.
IIIA,ntaep,pp. . 6$7$8.821-828.

amplifying the information contained in my note of February 19. Public Law 704-77th Congress, an Act to facilitate the disposi-
tion of prizes captured by the United States during the present war, and for other purposes was approved on August 18, 1942. [ 2 ] A copy of the Act is enclosed .

It will be perceived that the Act relates only to prizes captured during the present war, a matter raised in the note from the Acting Minister for External Affairs. It may be added concerning the other matter inquired about that the special prize commissioners which the district courts of the United States are authorized to appoint may exercise abroad the duties which are prescribed by law for such com-

missioners and such additional duties as the district courts may confer on them for carrying out the purposes of the Act . The duties of prize commissioners are set out in Title 34 U. S. C. Section 1138 which reads as follows :

"§ 1138. Duties of prize commissioners. The prize commissioners, or one of them, shall receive from the prize master the documents and papers, and inventory thereof, and shall take the affidavit of the prize master required by section 1134 of this title , and shall forthwith take the testimony of the witnesses sent in,
separate from each other, on interrogatories prescribed by the court, in the manner usual in prize courts ; and the witnesses shall not be permitted to see the interrogatories, documents, or papers, or to consult with counsel, or with any persons interested with-

out special authority from the court ; and witnesses who have the rights of neutrals shall be discharged as soon as practicable. The prize commissioners shall also take depositions de bene esse of the prize crew and others , at the request of the district attorney, on interrogatories prescribed by the court. They shall also , as soon as any prize property comes within the district for adjudication, examine the same , and make an inventory thereof, founded on an actual examination , and report to the court whether any part of it is in a condition requiring immediate sale for the interests of all parties, and notify the district attorney thereof ; and if it be necessary to the examination or making of the inventory that the cargo be unladen, they shall apply to the court for an order to the marshal to unlade the same, and shall , from time to time, report to the court anything relating to the condition of the property, or its custody or disposal, which may require any action by the court , but the custody of the property shall be in the marshal only. They shall also seasonably return into court, sealed and secured from inspection, the documents and papers which shall come to their hands, duly scheduled and numbered , and the other prepatory evidence, and the evidence taken de bene esse, and their own inventory of the prize property ; and if the captured vessel , or any of its cargo or stores, are such as in their judgment may be useful to the United States in war, they shall report the same to the Secretary of the Navy."

It will be noted that according to the terms of Section 3 of the above-mentioned Public Law 704 "the jurisdiction of prizes brought into the territorial waters of a cobelligerent shall not be exercised

56 Stat. 746. 50 U. S. C., Supp.
III, app . § 823.

under authority of this Act nor shall prizes be taken or appropriated within such territorial waters for the use of the United States unless

the Government having jurisdiction over such territorial waters consents to the exercise of such jurisdiction or to such taking or appropriation. " Section 7 of that Act states :
"A cobelligerent of the United States which consents to the

56 Stat. 747. 50 U. S. C., Supp. III, app. § 827.

exercise of the jurisdiction herein conferred with respect to prizes

of the United States brought into its territorial waters and to the

taking or appropriation of such prizes within its territorial waters for the use of the United States shall be accorded, upon proclama-

tion by the President of the United States, like privileges with

respect to prizes captured under authority of such cobelligerent

and brought into the territorial waters of the United States or

taken or appropriated in the territorial waters of the United States for the use of such cobelligerent. Reciprocal recognition

and full faith and credit shall be given to the jurisdiction acquired

by courts of a cobelligerent hereunder and to all proceedings had

or judgments rendered in exercise of such jurisdiction. "

In consideration of the provisions of Section 3, I should be grateful if you would inform me at the earliest possible date whether the Commonwealth Government would consent to the exercise of the proposed jurisdiction or to the taking or appropriation of prizes as therein

1392

SEÑOR SECRETARIO :

WASHINGTON, D. C. , a 29 de septiembre de 1943.

Tengo la honra de acusar recibo de la nota de Vuestra Excelencia del 25 de septiembre de 1943 , en la que se hace referencia al Memorándum de la Embajada del 24 de julio de 1943 y en la que se consigna un resumen del resultado de los diversos cambios de impresiones que se han llevado a cabo con respecto a la resolución final de las reclamaciones de los nacionales norteamericanos, cuyos derechos e intereses en la industria petrolera de México fueron afectados por actos de mi Gobierno posteriores al 17 de marzo de 1938 .
Me es grato manifestar a Vuestra Excelencia que mi Gobierno está de acuerdo con los términos del resumen consignado en la nota que contesto , a saber:

1. De acuerdo con el Dictamen Conjunto presentado el 17 de abril de 1942 por los señores Manuel J. Zevada y Morris L. Cooke , peritos designados por los respectivos gobiernos en cumplimiento del Arreglo del 19 de noviembre de 1941 , el Gobierno de México pagará al Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de América la suma de 23,995,991.00 de dólares moneda de los Estados Unidos, más intereses computados de conformidad con el Dictamen Conjunto a razón del 3% anual a partir del 18 de marzo de 1938.

3,796,391.04 de dólares, que representa la quinta parte del saldo , deberá pagarse en Washington el 30 de septiembre de 1943 y el resto , que asciende a 15,185,564.16 de dólares más intereses , se pagará en Washington en cuatro anualidades iguales , de 4,085,327.45 de dólares cada una, el día 30 de septiembre de cada uno de los años 1944 a 1947 inclusive .

3. Las sumas totales que el Gobierno de México pagará en esta forma, las cuales no estarán sujetas a deducciones por concepto de impuestos o reclamaciones de ningún género , constituirán el pago y la liquidación totales y definitivos de todas las reclamaciones en contra del Gobierno de México por parte de las compañías respectivas mencionadas en el Dictamen Conjunto del 17 de abril de 1942 y por parte también de las siguientes compañías no mencionadas en el citado Dictamen Conjunto :

58 STAT. ] MEXICO-PETROLEUM PROPERTIES- SEPT. 25, 29, 1943
4. El Gobierno de México exonera a todas las compañías incluídas en el párrafo precedente de todas las obligaciones que pueda tener derecho a exigir de dichas empresas , incluyendo impuestos y derechos fiscales no pagados y los desembolsos hechos legalmente por el Gobierno o que el mismo ha aceptado hacer en nombre de estas empresas . El Gobierno de México asume asimismo la responsabilidad de satisfacer y liquidar todas las reclamaciones de carácter privado en contra de dichas compañías - incluyendo reclamaciones de trabajo - que hayan sido o sean consideradas procedentes por los tribunales mexicanos administrativos o judiciales . Al efecto , el Gobierno de México conviene en dar los pasos necesarios para substituirse en lugar de cualquiera de las compañías que haya sido o sea demandada ante tales tribunales .
5. Antes de que el Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de América efectúe pago alguno a cualquiera compañía incluida en este convenio , la empresa que vaya a recibir el pago depositará en el Departamento de Estado los documentos e instrumentos legales que posea , comprobatorios de la propiedad de los bienes , derechos o intereses afectados , con objeto de que esta documentación sea entregada al Gobierno de México cuando haya cubierto el importe de la última de las anualidades que deberá liquidar conforme al presente convenio.
En virtud de lo expuesto , el Gobierno de México considera que la citada nota de Vuestra Excelencia de 25 del actual y esta respuesta constituyen el convenio a que se refiere el párrafo 16 del canje de notas del 19 de noviembre de 1941 .
Aprovecho la oportunidad para renovar a Vuestra Excelencia las seguridades de mi más alta y distinguida consideración .

SIRS :As provided in the exchange of notes dated November 19 , 1941 ,
between his Excellency, Cordell Hull, Secretary of State of The United States, and his Excellency Francisco Castillo Nájera, Mexican Ambassador to the United States, the undersigned were appointed by our respective governments as experts authorized to determine according to " equity and justice" for purposes of indemnification the compensation to be paid the nationals of the United States of America

Expropriation, and the exercise of the right of eminent domain, under the respective Constitutions and Laws of Mexico and the United States, are a recognized feature of the sovereignty of all modern States .

We have surveyed the works and lands involved and studied the

records of the properties, rights and interests appertaining thereto

and have mutually agreed that their value, as of March 18 , 1938 ,

should be fixed, in the sum of 23.995.991 .

Agreement between the United States of America and Mexico respecting the establishment of an Agricultural Commission. Effected by exchange of notes signed at Mexico City January 6 and 27, 1944.

January 6, 27, 1944 [E. A. S. 421]

The American Ambassador to the Mexican Minister of Foreign Affairs

No. 2180 EXCELLENCY :

EMBASSY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
Mexico, D.F., January 6, 1944

I have the honor to refer to conversations which took place in Mexico City between the Minister of Agriculture and Fomento of the United Mexican States , Ingeniero Marte R. Gomez , and the Secretary of Agriculture of the United States of America, the Honorable Claude R. Wickard, on the occasion of the visit of the latter to Mexico in 1942, with reference to the mutual advantages to the economies of the two countries of close collaboration in the field of agriculture and with reference to the establishment of a permanent Mexican-United Agricultural Commission. These conversations have been supplemented by conversations between Your Excellency and myself and between this Embassy and the Minister of Agriculture and Fomento, Ingeniero Marte R. Gomez.
I now have the honor under instructions from my Government, formally to propose the establishment of a permanent MexicanUnited States Agricultural Commission on the basis set forth below. As a result of the conversations which have taken place on this matter it is intended that this Commission would be a technical Commission and therefore composed of technicians in agriculture. In view of the fact that it is a technical commission which will occupy itself with agricultural programs of mutual interest to the two Governments, the Commission would function, of course, as a separate Commission and distinct from all others.
I should appreciate being informed by Your Excellency whether the proposals set forth below are agreeable to the Mexican Government.

1. There is hereby established the Mexican -United States Agricultural Commission with a view to (a ) coordinating the cooperative activities of the Departments of Agriculture of the two Governments

Mexican-United States Agricultural
lCiosmhmmeinsts.ion, estab-

already in operation, and (b) carrying into effect the recommenda-

tion of the Mexican -United States Commission for Economic Coopera-

tion, established by the President of the United States and the Presi-

dent of Mexico in April 1943, that the Departments of Agriculture of

the two countries take all appropriate steps to assure active and continuous cooperation.

1426

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [58 STAT.

Composition. General objective.

In a subsequent note, which will be addressed to Your Excellency in the very near future, I shall convey to Your Excellency further suggestions of my Government as to the composition and size of the Commission. It is the understanding of my Government that the Commission members shall have general technical competence in agriculture and be conversant with the resources, policies and programs of their respective Governments. The membership from each country should include the Agricultural Attaché stationed at the capital of the other country. One member of each country group will be designated as Chairman of his group and will serve as Co-Chairman of the Commission. Each member shall be authorized to designate an alternate.
2. The general objective of the Commission shall be to promote agriculture in Mexico and the United States along the lines mutually advantageous to the two countries, giving appropriate attention at the present time to developments that will make a maximum contribution
to the common war effort but keeping primarily in view the longer term aspects of agricultural development in the future years of peace to come.

(a ) Review current and prospective agricultural problems and trends of mutual interest to the two countries, including matters
relating to supplies of agricultural and food products and the facilities for their production, processing and handling, and to recommend from time to time specific undertakings for agricultural improvement in the interest of better utilization of agricultural resources.

(b) Consider and report on general plans in respect to the production and procurement of agricultural products needed to supply the essential civilian , military and rehabilitation needs of the United Nations, and to that end consider and report on the general policies which shall govern the carrying-out of such plans.
(c) Formulate and recommend plans and procedures for exchange of information on specific problems of scientific , technological, economic and social character in agriculture and rural life.
(d) Review and formulate proposals in reference to regulatory activities affecting agricultural production and trade between the two countries.

(e) Formulate plans and recommendations for the mutually advantageous utilization of available subject-matter, research personnel, and other technical agricultural resources in the two countries and, in this connection , encourage the training of agricultural specialists, for basic improvement in agricultural production and administration.

Committee on tech-
nical agricultural collaboration.

3. As a means of carrying out the objectives outlined under 2 ( c) , 2 (d ) and 2 (e ) , a committee on technical agricultural collaboration shall be established to work through and under the general supervision of the commission. The members of the technical committee

shall be appointed by the Secretaries of Agriculture of the two countries.

In transmitting the foregoing proposals for the consideration of Your Excellency's Government, I wish to state that it is the conviction of my Government that such a technical Agricultural Commission will be the effective means of assuring fruitful collaboration in the field of agriculture between the two Governments and the respective Departments of Agriculture.
Accept, Your Excellency, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration.

EXCELLENCY :

I have the honor to refer to conversations which have taken place

between officers of the Chinese Embassy and of the Department of

State with respect to the application of the United States Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, as amended , to Chinese nationals residing in the United States.
As you are aware, the Act provides that with certain exceptions

every male citizen of the United States and every other male person between the ages of eighteen and sixty-five, residing in the United

States , shall register. The Act further provides that , with certain exceptions, registrants within specified age limits are liable for active military service in the United States armed forces.

This Government recognizes that from the standpoint of morale of

the individuals concerned and the over-all military effort of the

countries at war with the Axis Powers, it would be desirable to permit

certain nationals of cobelligerent countries who have registered or who

may register under the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, as amended, to serve in the armed forces of their own country , should they desire to do so. It will be recalled that during the World War this Government signed conventions with certain associated powers on this subject. The United States Government believes, however, that under existing circumstances the same ends may now be accom-

Chinese nationals. Induction proce-
dure.

plished through administrative action, thus obviating the delays incident to the signing and ratification of conventions.
This Government is prepared, therefore, to initiate a procedure which will permit Chinese nationals who have registered under the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 , as amended, to elect to

serve in the forces of their own country, in lieu of service in the armed forces of the United States, at any time prior to their induction into the armed forces of this country. This Government is also prepared to afford to Chinese nationals who may already be serving in the armed forces of the United States an opportunity of electing to transfer to the armed forces of their own country. Detailed arrangements

for carrying out this agreement are to be worked out directly between the War Department and the Selective Service System on the part

of the United States Government and the appropriate authorities

of the Chinese Government. It should be understood , however, that in

all cases a person exercising an option under the agreement must ac-

tually be accepted by the military authorities of his country. Before the above-mentioned procedure will be made effective with
regard to China, this Department wishes to receive a note stating

Stipulations to be agreed to by China.

that your Government desires to avail itself of the procedure and

in so doing agrees that :

(a) No threat or compulsion of any nature will be exercised by the Chinese Government to induce any person in the United States to enlist in the forces of that Government or any foreign government ;
(b) Reciprocal treatment will be granted to American citizens by the Chinese Government ; that is, prior to induction in the armed forces of China they will be granted the opportunity of electing to serve in the armed forces of the United States in substantially the same manner as outlined above .

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your note of May 11, 1944, in regard to the proposed military service agreement between China and the United States, and to inform you that the appropriate authorities of this Government have agreed in principle to the stipulations contained in that note.

The War Department has stated that it is prepared to notify all Chinese nationals who already may be serving in the armed forces

Nov. 6, 1943 58 STAT. ] CHINA- MILITARY SERVICE- May 11, June 13, 1944
of the United States of their opportunity to elect to serve in the armed forces of their own country in lieu of serving in the Army of the United States. However, the War Department has pointed out that, in implementing the details of this proposed agreement , necessity requires that transfers from United States troops in overseas theaters be limited to those instances where suitable Chinese troops are serving
in the vicinity to which the individual could be assigned. The Director of the Selective Service System states that under pres-
ent Selective Service procedures each local board is requested to send Notice to Citizen of Allied Nation (Form 308 ) to the registrant. There are enclosed for your information specimen copies of Local Board Memoranda 129 and 129A, and Forms 221 , 308 , 502 , and 503, [ 1 ] which are for use by aliens of co-belligerent nations who wish to elect to serve in the armed forces of their own country.

I wish to refer to the Department's note of May 5, 1942 [ 1 ] in which my Government agreed to assist the Government of Paraguay by contributing $1,000,000 for the purpose of carrying out a cooperative health and sanitation program.
In fulfillment of this commitment and in accordance with Resolu-

This group will be under the immediate direction of the Chief Medical Officer of the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs

and will work in the closest cooperation with the appropriate Paraguayan officials. Approval for the actual execution of the specific projects agreed upon will be made by the respective Governments or their duly appointed agents upon recommendation of the Chief Medical Officer, acting in cooperation with the appropriate officials of the Paraguayan Government, or with appropriate officials designated by the Paraguayan Government for such projects as might be undertaken outside of the municipal areas of Asunción . Expenditures for such projects shall be made upon certification of the Chief Medical Officer and the appropriate Paraguayan official designated for the areas where projects will be executed .
The specific projects of interest to the Paraguayan Government include :

The American Embassy to the Peruvian Ministry for Foreign Affairs

No. 1719

EMBASSY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
Lima, March 9, 1944.

EXCELLENCY : I have the honor, at the instance of my Government and as a sequel
to a communication of January 28, 1944 , received in the Embassy from Dr. Luis E. Valcárcel, Director of the National Museum of Lima expressing the interest of that organization in obtaining the services of scientists of the Smithsonian Institution qualified in the field of anthropology, to state that the Institute of Social Anthropology of the Smithsonian Institute is now prepared to cooperate with the appropriate Peruvian authorities in the conduct of anthropological research and investigation at Lima, Cuzco, and elsewhere under the general program of the Interdepartmental Committee on Cooperation with the American Republics. The purposes of the project in Peru would include the provision of university and field training for students in anthropology and geography, assistance in coordinating the efforts of collaborating scientists of Peru and the United States in carrying out long-range social science studies in selected areas, the

provision of headquarters for field research where students from the

American republics could obtain guidance and training in field work after the war, and the publication of research findings, et cetera.
In order to facilitate this proposed collaboration , should it be found acceptable to Your Excellency's Government, there is transmitted a draft informal memorandum agreement for the consideration of the appropriate Peruvian authorities. In the event that the proposal is considered acceptable, Your Excellency's reply to that effect would complete the agreement. It will not be necessary that the memorandum be signed.
It will be noted that the draft constitutes a proposal whereby the Governments of the two countries would agree to cooperate through the appropriate agencies for the accomplishment of certain broad objectives, on the understanding that whereas the obligations to be assumed by the Government of the United States would involve primarily the detail of qualified scientists to Peru from time to time, the manner in which the various phases of the cooperation would be carried out would be made the subject of separate projects to be approved by both Governments in advance of their execution.

58 STAT. ] PERU-ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH- Mar. 9, 1944 Aug. 4, 1944
Should the enclosed draft memorandum agreement prove acceptable to Your Excellency's Government, I shall be glad, on being informed to that effect, to propose initial projects, involving the detail of personnel of the Smithsonian Institution, to be undertaken pursuant to the terms of the proposed memorandum agreement.
I avail myself of this occasion to extend to Your Excellency the renewed assurance of my highest consideration .

Memorandum agreement.
His Excellency Doctor ALFREDO SOLF Y MURO, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Lima, Peru.
MEMORANDUM AGREEMENT
As a part of its program for cooperation with the other American republics, the Government of the United States through the Institute of Social Anthropology of the Smithsonian Institution , and the Government of Peru through such agencies as it may designate, agree to cooperate for the following purposes :
1. To provide university and field training for students in anthropology and geography that will serve to equip the trainees for teaching and research positions in Peru when a need for teachers so trained is acknowledged to exist by the cooperating agencies of the two Governments.
2. To assist in coordinating the efforts of collaborating scientists of Peru and the United States in carrying out long-range social science studies in selected areas to be chosen by joint agreement between the cooperating agencies of the two Governments.
3. In connection with field work, to solicit the cooperation of institutions not mentioned herein , when the necessity for specialized research is indicated .
4. To provide a headquarters for field research in anthropology and geography where students from the American Republics can obtain guidance and training in field work after the war.
5. To further scientific investigations in anthropology and geography as the occasion may arise.
6. To publish research findings under such auspices and in such forms and languages as in the opinion of the cooperating agencies of the two Governments may render them the most useful.
Whereas the obligations to be assumed by the Government of the United States through the Institute of Social Anthropology of the Smithsonian Institution would involve primarily the detail of qualified scientists to Peru from time to time to assist the cooperating Peruvian agencies, the manner in which the two Governments would

1519

1520

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [58 STAT.
cooperate in carrying out the various phases of the work would be the subject of separate proposals. Such proposals would include a description of the work to be performed , and a statement of the conditions under which it would be undertaken. Each proposal would also be brought to the attention of the Peruvian Government in advance for preliminary consideration, and no action would be taken except with the full approval of the Peruvian authorities.
This agreement shall come into effect on the day on which it is accepted by the Government of Peru, and shall continue in effect until June 30, 1948, or for an additional period if mutually agreed upon in writing, unless the Congress of either country shall fail to make available the funds necessary for its execution , in which case it may be terminated on sixty days' advance written notice by the Government of either country.

Agreement. 7. When an insured parcel originating in one country and destined
to be delivered in the other country is reforwarded from there to a

third country or is returned to a third country, at the request of the

sender or of the addressee, the party entitled to the indemnity in case of loss, rifling, or damage occurring subsequent to the reforward-

lay claim in such a case only to the indemnity which the country

where the loss, rifling, or damage occurred consents to pay, or which

that country is obliged to pay in accordance with the agreement

made between the countries directly interested in the reforwarding or return. Either of the two countries signing the present Agree-

ment which wrongly forwards an insured parcel to a third country is

responsible to the sender to the same extent as the country of origin ; that is, within the limits of the present Agreement.

Until the contrary is proved , responsibility shall rest with the Administration which, having received the parcel from the other Administration without making any reservation and having been furnished with all the particulars for investigation prescribed by the regulations, cannot establish either proper delivery to the addressee or his agent, or other proper disposal of the parcel.

The Under Secretary of State to the Peruvian Minister of Finance and Commerce

DEPARTMENT OF STATE WASHINGTON

MY DEAR MR. MINISTER :

May 9, 1942

I refer to the notes exchanged between the Governments of the United States and Peru on April 23, 1942 [ 1] on rubber development in the Peruvian Amazon in which rubber development is to be carried forward. If it is the desire of the Government of Peru to

carry out health and sanitation work in connection with the production of rubber in this area , the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs is prepared to send at once to Peru , on your request, in cooperation with the appropriate officials of the Peruvian Government

and its health services such experts as your Government desires in order to collaborate in developing and executing a specific health and sanitation program. This program would be initially designed for the Amazon Basin area for the special purpose of aiding in the stimulation of rubber production , but at the desire of the Government of Peru could be extended to other areas.

For these purposes this Government, through the agency of the Coordinator of Inter -American Affairs, will provide an amount not to exceed $ 1,000,000 to be expended toward the development of this health and sanitation program.
It is understood that the Government of Peru will furnish such

expert personnel , materials , services, and funds for local expenditures
as it may be able to or consider necessary for the efficient development of the program.

The group of United States medical and sanitation experts which the Peruvian Government requests to be sent by the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs shall be under the direction

of the chief medical officer of the health and sanitation field party of the Coordinator's Office, who, in turn, will be under the supervision of the appropriate officials of the Peruvian Government .
Detailed arrangements for the execution of each project shall be discussed and agreed to between the chief medical officer and the appropriately designated official of the Peruvian Government. Technical advice and expert assistance of the United States medical and sanitation specialists will be made available to the appropriate Peruvian authorities at any time that the need for consultation arises.
1 [Not printed . ]

1544

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [ 58 STAT.
I understand that the Government of Peru would be particularly interested in continuing and expanding the measures and services which the health and sanitation agencies of the Government of Peru have been carrying out in the areas in question. These measures and services may be included under the following general headings :
1. Malaria control. 2. Yellow fever control. 3. General disease control by hospitals, clinics, and public educa-
tion. 4. Water-supply systems . 5. Sewage systems. 6. Garbage and rubbish disposal . It is contemplated that projects to be executed will be planned in conformity with availability of materials and that no projects will be initiated without reasonable expectation that they can be successfully completed in sufficient time to assist in the development of rubber production in the Amazon area. All projects completed in accordance with the present arrangement will of course be the property of the Government of Peru. I would appreciate it if you could confirm to me your approval of this general proposal, with the understanding that the details of the program will be the subject of further discussion and agreement.
Sincerely yours, SUMNER WELLES Under Secretary
His Excellency DAVID DASSO,
Minister of Finance and Commerce of Peru.

I am in full agreement with what you state in your note and want now to express to you the formal acceptance of your offer of such a valuable help in carrying out this most important work. As soon as I arrive in Lima steps will be taken in order that the appropriate of-

ficials of the Peruvian Government get in touch with the Office of the

MINISTERIO DE RELACIONES EXTERIORES
Bogotá, marzo 29 de 1943

SEÑOR EMBAJADOR :

Tengo el honor de comunicar a Vuestra Excelencia que el Gobierno de Colombia en el deseo de aumentar su contribución a la defensa del

hemisferio y teniendo en cuenta la Resolución XV de la Habana, aprobada por la Ley de la República número 20 de 1941 , y las recomendaciones adoptadas por la Conferencia de Cancilleres de Río de Janeiro sobre materiales estratégicos, está dispuesto a facilitar en su territorio la explotación y producción de tales materiales, sobre las siguientes bases:

I. El Gobierno de Colombia hará accesibles al Gobierno de los

Estados Unidos de América, o a las entidades oficiales respectivas de dicho Gobierno, todos los materiales estratégicos o materias primas básicas necesarios para la defensa del hemisferio , que se encuentren en baldíos de su propiedad . La explotación y producción de tales elementos se efectuará de acuerdo con las disposiciones legales vigentes sobre la materia.
II. El Gobierno de Colombia tomará las medidas necesarias para asegurar la exportación exclusivamente a los Estados Unidos de

América de los materiales estratégicos o materias primas básicas que se encuentren en terrenos de propiedad privada o se produzcan por particulares . Dicha exportación podrá efectuarse por conducto de las agencias del Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de América en Colombia, o directamente por los interesados. Lo anterior no implica concesión a ninguna entidad o persona del derecho exclusivo de explotación , producción , compra, venta , transporte o comercio de tales elementos o

productos dentro del territorio de la República . III. El Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de América comunicará

periódicamente y en forma confidencial al de Colombia las listas de productos que considere materias primas básicas o materiales estratégicos para los efectos del presente acuerdo . El Gobierno de Colombia se reserva el derecho de fijar, de acuerdo con el Gobierno de los Estados Unidos y cuando lo considere conveniente en vista de las condiciones de la producción y del mercado interno , los precios mínimos a que las agencias de los Estados Unidos en Colombia comprarán determinados artículos a sus productores o propietarios . En tales casos , los dos Gobiernos determinarán de común acuerdo la fecha desde la cual se

IV . El Gobierno de Colombia se reserva el derecho de retener
aquellas cantidades de materiales estratégicos o materias primas básicas que a su juicio sean esenciales para satisfacer las necesidades mínimas de su consumo interno y tomará las medidas conducentes a evitar la indebida acumulación de tales productos por parte de los productores, propietarios o intermediarios privados . El Gobierno de los Estados Unidos , con el fin de elaborar sus cálculos sobre las posibilidades de a provisionarse de ciertos productos , podrá solicitar del de Colombia informes periódicos sobre las cantidades de tales productos que sean esenciales para su consumo interno en un espacio determinado de tiempo .

Si a la terminación de los trabajos de exploración, explotación o transporte, el Gobierno de Colombia estuviere interesado en la adquisición de tales equipos o instalaciones móviles , los dos Gobiernos estudiarán la posibilidad de tal adquisición y convendrán las condiciones en que haya de efectuarse . Las dependencias correspondientes del Gobierno de Colombia acordarán con las agencias respectivas del Gobierno de los Estados Unidos los planes para la ejecución de dichas obras y las condiciones en que ellas se efectuarán y tomarán las medidas administrativas necesarias para asegurar su realización ; reglamentarán, asimismo de común acuerdo, el uso oficial y particular de tales obras en forma que no interfiera con la prosecución de los fines primordiales a que se destinen . Las obligaciones que asuma en desarrollo de este punto cualquier agencia autorizada del Gobierno de los Estados Unidos o cualquier dependencia administrativa del Gobierno de Colombia , obligarán a los Gobiernos respectivos.

life history , distribution , abundance, and migration of commercial

shrimp and such other important marine fishery products as time and facilities will permit ; collection and analysis of statistics of commercial

production of the fishing industry ; and a study of present fishing methods with a view to devising means for their improvement both in the interest of economy and efficiency of operation ; and a study of the best means of conserving fishery resources, consistent with advantageous economic utilization .
It is understood that exhaustive studies will not have been com-

pleted at the end of the two year period , but it is expected that sufficient data will have been obtained at that time to make it possible to formulate plans for fishery administration and regulation , and provide sufficient training for Mexican fishery workers to enable them to carry on the permanent biological and statistical studies that con-

tinuously should accompany commercial fishing activities in the

interest of scientific management and conservation . The Government of the United States will make available to the Reports.

Mexican Government, from time to time, reports on the progress of the investigations , and as soon as possible after conclusion of the two year study will submit a comprehensive report covering :

(a) The Scientific data obtained and the biological conclusions reached concerning the shrimp and other marine fishery resources of Mexican waters ;
(b) Suggestions for the administration , development and management of the Mexican marine fishery resources in the interest of conservation and economic utilization ; and
(c) A summary of the nature and scope of continuing studies and

Government as permanent activities to parallel the actual operations

of the fishing industry.

Outline of proposed plan .

Following is an outline of the plan under which the Fish and Wild-

life Service proposes to cooperate with the Department of Fisheries

of Mexico :

1. The Fish and Wildlife Service will assign to Mexico Mr. Milton J. Lindner, an aquatic biologist of its Division of Fishery Biology who is already known to the Mexican authorities , to assist in planning and directing the proposed studies , his services to be rendered on a part-time basis covering a period of approximately six months of each of two consecutive years .
2. The Fish and Wildlife Service will pay Mr. Lindner's salary and other expenses during the entire period of his services.
3.-The Fish and Wildlife Service will provide, for the duration of the studies , part-time clerical assistance, for Mr. Lindner ; pay expenses incident to the annual rental, furnishing, equipment and supplies for an office and laboratory in Mexico City, or elsewhere in Mexico ; and defray all expenses incident to communication services and the transportation of supplies , equipment and scientific materials .
4. The Fish and Wildlife Service will also loan for the duration of
the studies such supplies , equipment , books, or other materials as it may now have available for that purpose.
5. It is proposed that the Government of Mexico assign three assistants for the shrimp investigations and pay their salaries and travel and subsistence expenses, and that additional personnel be provided if studies of other fisheries are undertaken simultaneously. Persons already employed by the Mexican Department of Fisheries or persons familiar with the marine fisheries and possessing training in biology shall be given preference for these assignments, and it is suggested that they be selected with a view to their future employment by the Department of Fisheries to carry out the recommendations made at the end of the two year study .
6. It is proposed that the Government of Mexico provide suitable office and laboratory facilities and equipment for the investigation at Guaymas, Sonora ; that funds be made available for the charter, when needed , of a small vessel for off-shore studies at an estimated annual cost of about 2,500 pesos ; and that approximately 5,000 pesos be set aside for miscellaneous scientific equipment, and miscellaneous fishing equipment and supplies (including 2,500 pesos for shrimp pins and tags which have already been ordered by the Mexican Government) ,
7. The expenses incident to the obligations mentioned in Items 5 and 6 , shall be paid directly by the Mexican Government .

NOVEMBER 22nd, 1944.

SIR, Under instructions from my Government, I have the honour to
refer to recent discussions with respect to the post-war disposition of defence projects , installations and facilities built or provided in Canada by the Government of the United States. This matter was the subject of a recommendation of the Canada - United States Permanent Joint Board on Defence, adopted on January 13, 1943, and subsequently embodied in an Exchange of Notes dated January 27, 1943.

After further study, and in the light of experience in connection with specific agreements already reached , it appeared desirable to the Board to amend its earlier recommendation and to make the revised recommendation applicable to all projects , disposition of which remains unsettled . Accordingly, on September 7, 1944, the Board adopted the following recommendation :

"The Permanent Joint Board on Defence recommends that the

following formula be applied to the disposition of all defence facilities constructed or provided in Canada by the United States (and mutatis mutandis to any defence facilities constructed or provided in the United States by Canada ) which have not already been dealt with.
Immovables

A-The Government of the United States shall, within three months from the date of the approval of this Recommendation , supply the Government of Canada with a list of immovables (hereinafter referred to as facilities ) which it desires to make subject to the provisions of this Recommendation.
B-In the case of each of the facilities included in the list referred to in A, the Canadian Government and the United States Government will each appoint one qualified appraiser whose joint duty it will be to appraise such facility in order to determine the fair market value thereof at the time and place of appraisal.

EXCELLENCY :

DEPARTMENT OF STATE WASHINGTON December 20, 1944

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your note no. 399 , November 22, 1944, referring to recent discussions on the disposition of defense projects, installations and facilities built or provided in Canada by the Government of the United States and informing me of the approval by the Canadian Government of the 33rd Recommendation of the Permanent Joint Board on Defense, United States and Canada on this subject. The 33rd Recommendation amends and supersedes the 28th Recommendation of the Board which was embodied in the exchange of notes of January 27, 1943.
The United States Government has been pleased to observe that , pursuant to the 28th Recommendation specific agreements have already been reached covering the disposition of the major defense projects constructed by the United States in Canada. It is considered that the current Recommendation of the Board is suitable for application to all projects, disposition of which remains unsettled and I am glad, therefore, to inform you that the Government of the United States approved the 33rd Recommendation on November 11 , 1944.
It is noted that the Canadian Government's approval is subject to the following proviso :

In accepting the Canadian Government's proviso to the 33rd Rec- viso ommendation, I believe it useful to mention that it is understood by this Government from an explanatory memorandum kindly furnished by the Canadian authorities that expenses of custody and demolition will be taken into account by the appraisers and will through their findings be reflected in the final accounting.
In conclusion I may state that the United States Government accepts the proposal that your note under reference and this reply shall be regarded as placing on record the understanding arrived at between the two Governments on this matter.

Accept, Excellency , the renewed assurances of my highest consideration.

CARACAS, 13 de octubre de 1.942

SEÑOR EMBAJADOR :
Autorizado por mi Gobierno tengo a honra dejar constancia en esta nota de que, como resultado de las conversaciones entre Vuestra Excelencia y el suscrito , se ha convenido entre el Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de Venezuela y el Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de América en lo siguiente :
Primero: El Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de América, por órgano de su dependencia la Rubber Reserve Company, que en lo adelante se denominará Reserve, conviene en establecer o en hacer establecer en Venezuela una Agencia que en lo adelante se denominará la Agencia, la cual estará autorizada para cooperar en el desarrollo de la producción del caucho en Venezuela, así como también para adquirir en el Territorio de la República toda clase de caucho que se explote en Venezuela y de productos de caucho elaborados con materia prima nacional, siempre que el caucho explotado o los productos elaborados con éste, no sean esenciales para las necesidades internas del país , de acuerdo con lo estipulado en el presente modus vivendi. A tal efecto , el Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de Venezuela conviene en que la Agencia gozará de todas las facilidades requeridas para el debido desempeño de sus funciones.
Segundo: El Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de Venezuela , habida consideración de que el caucho que se exporte por órgano de Reserve irá íntegramente a los Estados Unidos de América , país que necesita de grandes cantidades de dicho producto para fines de defensa continental , conviene en conceder a la Agencia el derecho exclusivo de exportar una vez cubiertas las necesidades del consumo interno nacional , el caucho que se explote en Venezuela y los productos inservibles de caucho existentes en la República. A este efecto y de conformidad con lo previsto en el artículo segundo del Decreto Ejecutivo Nº 235 , de fecha 9 de octubre de 1.942 , el Ejecutivo Federal, por órgano del Despacho correspondiente, designará a Reserve como la entidad que tendrá derecho exclusivo a la exportación de caucho . También se

58 STAT. ] VENEZUELA-RUBBER PRODUCTION-OCT. 13, 1942
compromete el Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de Venezuela a tomar medidas adecuadas tendientes a la conservación del caucho para destinarlo a usos esenciales de defensa continental o indispensables para el mantenimiento de los transportes dentro del país .-Asimismo , el Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de Venezuela , tomará las medidas necesarias para impedir el acaparamiento del caucho o de sus productos .
Tercero: El Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de América se compromete a que la Agencia de Reserve compre y, por su parte, el Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de Venezuela se compromete a vender y a hacer vender a la Agencia todo el caucho y todos los productos disponibles en el territorio de la República y que no se requieran para el uso o consumo interno de Venezuela . A este efecto y de conformidad con lo previsto en el artículo tercero del citado Decreto Ejecutivo N° 235 , de fecha 9 de octubre de 1.942 , el Ejecutivo Federal , por órgano del respectivo Despacho , designará a la Agencia como la entidad exclusivamente autorizada para comprar el caucho que no sea necesario para el consumo interno . Las necesidades esenciales de Venezuela, en lo tocante a caucho en bruto y a caucho viejo , inclusive el caucho contenido en los productos de caucho , se fijan por el presente convenio en un máximo de ochocientas toneladas anuales de caucho lavado y seco o su equivalente ; pero las Altas Partes Contratantes han convenido en que esta cantidad puede ser aumentada de mutuo acuerdo cuando se demuestre que se necesita una mayor cantidad para satisfacer la demanda del país .
Cuarto: El Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de Venezuela y el Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de América convienen en que las compras de productos de caucho que efectúe la Agencia de Reserve , en conformidad con las estipulaciones de este convenio , serán hechas a los precios netos del comercio que regían para el primero de junio de mil novecientos cuarenta y dos en el territorio de Venezuela . No obstante, esos precios podrán ser aumentados mediante acuerdos entre las Partes a fin de hacer los ajustes necesarios al aumento en el precio del caucho en bruto o de cualquiera otra materia que se requiera para la manufactura de los productos .
Quinto: El Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de Venezuela y el Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de América convienen en que el precio básico que por libra (Kgs . 0,453,6 ) pagará la Agencia de Reserve en las compras de caucho que efectúe de acuerdo con este convenio para la exportación será de cuarenta y cinco (45) centavos , moneda de los Estados Unidos de América , en los puertos venezolanos de Ciudad Bolívar o Caripito, o cualquier otro puerto que sea escogido de mutuo acuerdo , para el equivalente de la calidad "Upriver Acre Fine", y de treinta y tres (33 ) centavos, también moneda de los Estados Unidos de América, por libra (Kgs . 0,453,6 ) para la buena calidad corriente de Castilloa "Scrap" , como se la conoce en Nueva York, con las diferencias del caso para los precios de otros tipos y calidades . Queda entendido que el precio básico , junto con las citadas diferencias, se denominará "el precio fijado." Los precios que pagará la Agencia en las compras que efectúe en otros puntos del interior de Venezuela estarán constituídos por "el precio fijado",
93650°- -45- PT. II- 41

1573

1574

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [ 58 STAT.
menos el valor de los gastos de transporte del punto donde se efectúe la compra hasta los mencionados puertos de Ciudad Bolívar y Caripito. Queda convenido que el Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de Venezuela hará que se establezca "el precio fijado" para todas las ventas de caucho para consumo doméstico o para uso dentro del país. Las Partes convienen en que el precio básico fijado podrá ser modificado o ajustado durante la vigencia de este convenio, a fin de adaptarlo a las nuevas condiciones o circunstancias que pudieren surgir. Reserve pagará, igualmente, además de los precios indicados, primas por sus compras de caucho en Venezuela . Dichas primas serán pagadas al Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de Venezuela así: dos y medio centavos , moneda de los Estados Unidos de América, por cada libra (Kgs. 0,453,6 ) sobre todo el caucho comprado que exceda de trescientas toneladas y que no llegue a setecientas toneladas, y cinco centavos , moneda de los Estados Unidos de América, por libra (Kgs. 0,453,6 ) sobre todo el caucho comprado que exceda de setecientas toneladas durante cualquier año de la vigencia de este Convenio . El monto de estas primas será pagado por Reserve en la Tesorería Nacional de Venezuela , mediante las correspondientes Planillas que liquidará el organismo competente a medida que se efectúe la exportación de caucho y sobre cada cantidad exportada. A su vez, el Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de Venezuela se compromete a in-
vertir una cantidad igual al valor de las primas pagadas por la Agencia de Reserve, en el fomento inmediato de la producción y en el mejoramiento de la calidad del caucho silvestre existente en el Territorio de la República, a cuyo efecto Reserve podrá hacer las indicaciones adecuadas . Se ha convenido en que Reserve podrá cargar el monto de las primas al saldo no invertido del Fondo de Fomento a que se refiere la cláusula siguiente .
Sexta: El Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de América, por órgano de Reserve, conviene en establecer un Fondo de Fomento hasta de quinientos mil dólares ($500.000 ) , que invertirá Reserve, de acuerdo con el Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de Venezuela y en las proporciones que se considere convenientes o necesarias a los fines de este convenio, en el desarrollo y aumento de la producción de caucho, así como también en el mejoramiento de la calidad del mismo existente en la República, en el perfeccionamiento de los sistemas empleados para explotarlo , en el estímulo de condiciones para una producción máxima y en obras permanentes y vehiculos de trasporte, siempre que propendan a hacer factible la explotación del caucho en gran escala. La Agencia podrá, mientras existan fondos no invertidos , utilizar parte de los mismos para dar suministros a los explotadores de caucho , siendo de advertir que, una vez restituidos estos suministros, las sumas a ellos correspondientes deberán ser abonadas nuevamente al Fondo para ser empleadas en los fines enunciados . Cuando circunstancias especiales así lo aconsejen, la Agencia podrá utilizar también parte de dichos fondos en el pago de primas especiales para los productores que se consideren convenientes a fin de estimular las explotaciones en gran escala. El Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de Venezuela, de acuerdo con la Agencia, designará un consultor, pagado

58 STAT. ] VENEZUELA-RUBBER PRODUCTION- OCT. 13, 1942
por el mismo Gobierno , cuyas funciones consistirán en indicar a dicha Agencia los procedimientos más adecuados para el máximo rendimiento de las actividades de la explotación del caucho en Venezuela.
Séptimo: A fin de lograr una producción máxima de caucho , el Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de Venezuela conviene en tomar medidas adecuadas tendientes a asegurar una participación equitativa en los precios pagados por la Agencia a todas las clases de personas que intervengan en los trabajos de explotación del caucho y para lograr, asimismo , que los precios que paguen dichos trabajadores por los artículos que necesiten para su uso y consumo sean justos y equitativos . Con este fin , el Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de Venezuela fijará los salarios de los trabajadores y también los precios que estos pagarán, a su vez , por los artículos de uso y consumo que necesiten. El Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de Venezuela hará que los precios por él fijados se publiquen en todas las localidades de las regiones productoras . Reserve colaborará ampliamente con el Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de Venezuela para lograr los objetivos expuestos e igualmente consultará al Ministerio del Trabajo y de Comunicaciones de Venezuela para el logro de dichos fines . Reserve empleará también cualesquiera otros medios que propendan al mejoramiento del estado económico de los trabajadores en las explotaciones del caucho .
Octavo: Ha sido convenido entre las Partes que las cantidades que invierta la Agencia de Reserve por cuenta del Fondo de Fomento en el desarrollo de los cultivos del caucho , así como en obras permanentes, tales como caminos , embarcaderos , habitaciones , depósitos , etc. , quedarán al término de este modus vivendi a beneficio de la nación venezolana, sin que ésta tenga que pagar ninguna indemnización. Tampoco asume el Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de Venezuela ninguna obligación con respecto a las cantidades que invierta la Agencia de Reserve por suministros a los explotadores de caucho o por primas en favor de los mismos, así como en el mejoramiento de los sistemas de explotación o en las calidades del caucho . Ha sido también convenido que las cosas muebles que la Agencia de Reserve lleve a los lugares de explotación , tales como vehículos , embarcaciones , máquinas, implementos de trabajo y otros semejantes , permanecerán de la exclusiva propiedad de Reserve y la Agencia podrá reexportarlos o venderlos en el país por su cuenta .
Noveno: En atención al interés nacional que reviste para el desarrollo del cultivo del caucho en Venezuela el presente modus vivendi, el Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de Venezuela , conviene en exonerar de los derechos de importación a todas las máquinas , útiles , vehículos , embarcaciones , materiales para la construcción de obras y edificios y demás implementos que importe la Agencia de Reserve con destino exclusivo a los trabajos de explotación del caucho y de desarrollo y mejoramiento de su cultivo en Venezuela.
Esta nota y la respuesta conforme de Vuestra Excelencia constituirán un modus vivendi que durará un año , y podrá ser prorrogado por simple manifestación de voluntad del Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de Venezuela, en cada oportunidad anual, hasta el 31 de diciembre

Sin embargo , es entendido que, si en virtud de preceptos constitucionales , el Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de Venezuela restablece en cualquier fecha las garantías restringidas por el ya citado Decreto Ejecutivo de 9 de octubre de 1.942 , en tal caso habrá de considerarse resuelto de pleno derecho el presente modus vivendi.
Válgome de la oportunidad para renovar a Vuestra Excelencia las seguridades de mi más alta y distinguida consideración .

products manufactured from national raw material, as long as the rubber produced or the products manufactured with the latter are not essential to the internal needs of the country, in accordance with the stipulations in the present modus vivendi. To such an end , the Government of the United States of Venezuela agrees that the Agency will enjoy all the facilities required in the due fulfillment of its functions.
Second: The Government of the United States of Venezuela, taking into consideration that the rubber exported through Reserve

end and in agreement with the stipulations of Article 3 of the aforementioned Executive Decree No. 235 dated October 9, 1942 , the Federal Executive, by means of the respective Ministry, will designate the Agency as the entity exclusively authorized to buy the rubber not necessary for internal consumption. The essential needs of Venezuela, as regards raw rubber and reclaimed rubber, including the rubber contained in rubber products , is fixed by the present agreement at a maximum of eight hundred tons annually of washed and dried rubber or its equivalent ; but the High Contracting Parties have agreed that this amount may be increased by mutual agreement when it is demonstrated that a larger amount is needed to satisfy the country's requirements.
Fourth: The Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United States of Venezuela agree that the purchases of rubber products made by the Reserve Agency, in accordance with the stipulations of this agreement, will be made at the net market prices which were in effect on the first of June, 1942 , in the territory of Venezuela. Nevertheless , those prices may be increased through agreements between both Parties in order to make the necessary adjustments to the increase in the price of raw rubber or of any other material which is required in the manufacture of the products.
Fifth: The Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United States of Venezuela agree that the basic price per pound ( Kgs. 0.4536 ) which will be paid by the Reserve Agency in the rubber purchases which it may make in accordance with this agreement for export will be forty-five (45 ) cents United States Currency, in the Venezuelan ports of Ciudad Bolívar or Caripito, or any other port which may be chosen by mutual agreement, for the equivalent of the quality "Upriver Acre Fine", ( washed and dried) , and of thirty-three ( 33 ) cents, also United States Currency, per pound (Kgs. 0.4536 ) for the good common quality Castilloa "Scrap", as it is known in New York, with the corresponding differences in the prices for the other types and qualities. It is understood that the basic price, together with the aforementioned differences, will be called "the fixed price". The prices which the Agency will pay in the purchases it makes in other points of the interior of Venezuela will be constituted by "the fixed price", less the cost of transportation expenses from the point where the purchase is made to the aforementioned ports of Ciudad Bolívar and Caripito. It is agreed that the Government of the United States of Venezuela will cause to be established the fixed price for all sales of rubber for domestic consumption or use within the country. The Parties agree that the fixed basic price may be modified or adjusted during the time this agreement is in effect, in order to adapt it to the new conditions or circumstances which may arise. Reserve will pay, also , besides the indicated prices, premiums for its rubber purchases in Venezuela . The said premiums will be paid to the Government of the United States of Venezuela thus : two and one-half (2-2 ) cents, United States Currency, per pound ( Kgs. 0.4536 ) on all the rubber bought which exceeds three hundred tons and does not exceed seven hundred tons

in any one year that this agreement is in effect, and five (5) cents,

United States Currency, per pound (Kgs . 0.4536 ) on all rubber bought

which exceeds seven hundred tons during any one year that this agreement is in effect . The sum total of these premiums will be

paid by Reserve at the National Treasury of Venezuela, through the

payment of the corresponding vouchers by the appropriate agency, as the rubber is exported and on each amount exported . On its part, the Government of the United States of Venezuela binds itself to

expend an equal amount to the value of the bonuses paid by the Re-

serve Agency in the immediate development of production and in the

betterment of the quality of wild rubber existing in the Territory of

CARACAS, 27 de septiembre de 1.944 SEÑOR EMBAJADOR :
Tengo a honra dejar constancia en esta nota de que, como resultado de las conversaciones celebradas entre Vuestra Excelencia y el suscrito, ha quedado convenido lo siguiente entre el Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de Venezuela y el Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de América:
PRIMERO: El Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de América, por medio de su dependencia , la Rubber Development Corporation (sucesora de la Rubber Reserve Company) , que en lo sucesivo será llamada "Development", conviene en pagar o hacer que se pague una prima neta de 33% % sobre el " precio fijado" que se expresa en el cambio de notas efectuado entre Vuestra Excelencia y el suscrito, de fecha 13 de octubre de 1.942 , el cual estableció el "precio fijo " de 45 centavos (moneda de los Estados Unidos) por libra (Kgs . 0.4536) en los puertos venezolanos de Ciudad Bolívar y Caripito, o cualquier otro puerto venezolano que se designare de mutuo acuerdo , para el equivalente de la calidad "Upriver Acre Fine" (lavado y secado ) , y de 33 centavos (moneda de los Estados Unidos) por libra (Kgs . 0.4536 ) por la calidad buena corriente de "castilloa scrap", como se le llama en Nueva York, con las correspondientes diferencias de precio para otros tipos y calidades , debiéndose pagar esa prima por el caucho que esté listo para la inspección de su calidad o que haya sido inspeccionado por Development en un puerto de embarque convenido y que haya sido ofrecido en venta a Development durante el período que comenzará en la fecha en que se acepte la proposición contenida en la presente y que terminará el 31 de marzo de 1.945 ; quedando entendido que todo caucho ofrecido posteriormente a Development será comprado de acuerdo con el Artículo Quinto del precitado canje de notas sin el pago de la prima arriba mencionada, a menos que nuestros respectivos Gobiernos convengan por escrito en continuar pagándola después de dicha fecha.-Queda expresamente entendido y convenido que después de hacer los descuentos consiguientes por diferencias en las clases y calidades, el "precio fijado " aplicable a "weak fine smoked ball" a base del peso en San Fernando de Atabapo y otras estaciones establecidas en el Territorio Federal Amazonas, será el de 35 centavos (moneda de los Estados Unidos ) por libra (Kgs . 0.4536 ) .
SEGUNDO: En vista de que la precitada prima se paga para compensar el aumento de jornales , costo de vida y otras cosas que afectan el costo de producción del caucho, así como para estimular la mayor producción , queda entendido y convenido que Development suprimirá en la fecha más próxima posible todos los pagos suplementarios tales como los que se hicieren por concepto de alimentos y bonificaciones , por reclutamiento u otras contribuciones que hasta ahora venía haciendo . Pero, Development seguirá proporcionando durante el

58 STAT. ] VENEZUELA- RUBBER PRODUCTION-OCT. 13, 1942

período del pago de la prima que se estipula en la presente, los medios para el trasporte del caucho por el Rio Orinoco a Sanariapo y Morganito. Queda entendido que durante el período citado el Gobierno de Venezuela pagará, a título de incentivo, 10 centavos (moneda de los Estados Unidos) por libra (Kgs . 0.4536 ) por todo el caucho producido en Venezuela y que, a fin de compensar el alto costo de producción en el Territorio Federal Amazonas, pagará también una prima adicional de producción de 19,61 centavos (moneda de los Estados Unidos ) por libra (Kgs. 04536 ) por el caucho producido dentro de los límites de ese territorio . Queda entendido además que la suma global del precio y primas por caucho fino ahumado en bolas ("smoked ball fine rubber" ) producido en el Territorio Federal Amazonas que monta a 76.28 centavos (moneda de los Estados Unidos) por libra, será distribuido de acuerdo con la siguiente escala que será fijada por el Gobierno de Venezuela :

Contratistas Principales Sub-contratistas Productores

4.08 centavos (moneda de los Estados Unidos ) por libra.
13.62 centavos (moneda de los Estados Unidos) por libra.
58.58 centavos (moneda de los Estados Unidos ) por libra.

La anterior escala de distribución será aplicable en proporción a las correspondientes diferencias de precios por otros tipos y calidades de caucho producidas en dicho territorio.-
TERCERO: El Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de Venezuela cooperará con Development en los siguientes puntos:

1.-Atribuirá el uso de llantas, cámaras de aire, y otros productos manufacturados de caucho, a fines únicamente esenciales , con el objeto de aprovechar lo más posible la cuota de caucho asignada a los Estados Unidos de Venezuela para el consumo interno.
2.-Fomentará lo más que sea posible el uso en Venezuela de caucho sintético y de caucho usado .
3.-Publicará los nuevos precios fijados, estableciendo también la escala de los precios que serán pagados en lugares del interior . Además, dicha escala de nuevos precios será publicada en los periódicos convenientes y se distribuirán circulares apropiadas (que serán suplidas por Development ) para su distribución en las regiones productoras de caucho .

4.-Establecerá o hará establecer el "precio fijado ", más la prima neta pagadera por Development según la presente, más las bonificaciones pagaderas por el Gobierno de Venezuela a los contratistas o caucheros , en todas las compras y ventas de caucho para consumo o uso domésticos dentro de los Estados Unidos de Venezuela .

Queda entendido que esta nota y la respuesta de Vuestra Excelencia en los mismos términos , constituirán un acuerdo firme entre el Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de Venezuela y el Gobierno de los Estados Unidos de América.

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of Your Excellency's Note No. 1500 dated March 28, 1944, [ 1 ] which refers to conversations between representatives of my Government and the Minister of Public

Education regarding the possible establishment of a cooperative educational program in Honduras, and expresses the desire of the Honduran Government to place in operation such a program. It is gratifying to learn that your Excellency approves of cooperative action in this field, and it is believed that the resulting interchange of educational ideas and methods will be mutually beneficial.

For the purpose of carrying out the proposed program in Honduras, the Government of the United States, acting through the Inter-American Educational Foundation , Incorporated , is prepared to provide

the sum of Eighty Thousand Dollars, United States Currency. This amount is to be made available for projects to be approved mutually

by representatives of the two Governments and for paying the salaries and other expenses of the educational specialists furnished by the Foundation. It is proposed that the Honduran Government provide the sum of Eighty Thousand Lempiras, Honduran currency , in addi-

tion to such personnel , supplies, and materials as it may see fit to provide within Honduras, and that a special cooperative service, similar to the Servicio Cooperativo Interamericano de Salud Publica, be established for the carrying out of this program, which, it is anticipated , will be carried on over a period of approximately three years.
If it is agreeable to Your Excellency, the Foundation will send a group of educational specialists to Honduras who will be acceptable to the Honduran Government. This group will be in charge of an official who will be designated as the Chief of Staff of the InterAmerican Educational Foundation, Incorporated, who will be the representative of the Foundation in connection with this program, and who would also serve as the Director of the special cooperative service. The specific projects and activities to be undertaken by the special cooperative service will be mutually agreed upon by representatives of the two Governments, and will include the sending of Honduran specialists in education to the United States.
If agreeable to the Government of Honduras it is also proposed that the detailed arrangements for the establishment of the special co-

The Secretary of State to the Panamanian Ambassador

August 31 , 1940 EXCELLENCY :
I have the honor to invite Your Excellency's attention to the provisions of the Trans-Isthmian Highway Convention signed by representatives of the United States of America and Panama at Washington on March 2, 1936 , concerning which conversations have been held with Your Excellency with a view to arriving at a mutually acceptable agreement as to the manner in which our two Governments may best coordinate their efforts in the building of the Highway.
In order to expedite the construction of the Trans-Isthmian Highway, which for the first time will complete the connection between the capital city of Panamá with the other principal Panamanian city of Colón, and for the purpose of facilitating the defense of the Panama Canal which is of such vital importance to our two countries, I have the honor to inform you that the Government of the United States is prepared to bear the full engineering cost for a dual highway and the construction cost for a twenty-foot roadway between the Madden Dam and Cativá.
During the course of the conversations referred to above, it will be recalled that my Government indicated that it might be desirable for defense purposes to construct a highway capable of withstanding greater stresses and strains than was contemplated at the time the Trans-Isthmian Highway Convention was negotiated. My Government's offer mentioned in the preceding paragraph is therefore contingent upon the agreement of your Government to improve the construction specifications contained in Article IV of the TransIsthmian Highway Convention to permit of the use of such standards and specifications as the United States may determine necessary for defense purposes . All other provisions of the Convention would of course continue to remain in full force and effect.
In the course of the conversations between our two Governments
with regard to the best way to cooperate in this matter, we also discussed the bases of the arrangement under which the Government of the United States would, if its offer is accepted by the Government of Panama, make the engineering survey for a dual highway and construct at its own expense the twenty-foot roadway between the Madden Dam and Cativá. There is attached a memorandum dated
August 29, 1940 embodying my understanding of the arrangement discussed during these conversations.

MR. SECRETARY:
I take special pleasure in acknowledging to Your Excellency the receipt of your very interesting note of August 31 , 1940, the text of which reads as follows:

Ante, p. 1593.

[Here follows the text of the note of August 31 , 1940 from the Secretary of State to the Panamanian Ambassador.]

It gives me great satisfaction to state to Your Excellency that my Government accepts with pleasure the friendly offer which is made to it through that communication by the enlightened Government of the United States, in the terms expressed therein and in the Memorandum which Your Excellency was good enough to send with it as an integral part of the said note, it being understood that the construction specifications for the Trans-Isthmian Highway indicated as minimum in

1598 53 Stat. 1871.

INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS OTHER THAN TREATIES [58 STAT.
Section IV of the Convention signed by our Governments on March 2, 1936 can be improved in the construction proposed by Your Government in order to meet "such standards and specifications as the United States may determine necessary for defense purposes," and that the other articles of the Convention of 1936, referred to , shall continue in full force and effect, including the seventh, which stipulates that both Panama and the United States shall have equally the unrestricted use of the Trans-Isthmian Highway, subject only to the laws and regulations in force in the respective jurisdictions on vehicular traffic.
My Government appreciates at its full value this act of open friendship and solidarity on the part of Your Excellency's illustrious Government, which is destined to intensify and fortify, rendering still firmer, the manifold spiritual, political and economic ties which happily bind our two countries, and which have always existed , beginning, in truth , to be forged in the very commencement of our independent life.
In harmony with that intention of establishing not only commercial interchange but also a true spiritual understanding that may serve as a firm basis for political and economic relations, my Government is disposed and has decided, as I had the honor to state to His Excellency President Roosevelt in my speech of presentation of my credentials as Ambassador of Panama before his Government, to do everything in its power to the end that "our relations may continue to develop, let us say with confidence, translated into effective solidarity, harmony and cooperation".
Furthermore, this highway will doubtless serve to strengthen the capacity of our two Governments to cooperate reciprocally in an effective manner in the defense of the great work of the Canal .
I request Your Excellency to accept the renewed homage of my most distinguished consideration.
