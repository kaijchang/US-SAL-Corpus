fied, according to law, are hereby authorized and empowered to serve

same process, as the marshal of the District of Columbia, or his deputies,

are authorized to do; and that a commission of five per cent, be allowed

the constable for every sum thereon by him levied : Provided, That the

said constables shall, before they proceed to the discharge of the duties

required by this act, give bond to the United States, with good and suffi-

cient security, in the penalty of two thousand dollars, to be approved of

ment, or execution, shall be received or recorded as satisfied, by the said

strued to prohibit or prevent the marshal, or his deputies, in the respec-

tive counties in the District of Columbia, from executing or levying exe-

cutions, issued by a justice of the peace, for small debts, out of court,

when the same are put into their hands for that purpose, in the same

manner as by law they have been, or now are, authorized to do; but for

executing or levying such executions, the said marshal, or his deputies,

shall be entitled to the same commission, and nothing more, as is herein

allowed to constables in such cases; and where the marshal or constable

shall have received money, on any judgment or execution, not exceeding

twenty dollars, and shall fail or omit to pay the same to the plaintiff,

or his agent, when thereto demanded, or shall omit or fail to return any

execution within the time limited for such return, it shall and may be

lawful for any court of record, within the District of Columbia, on

motion made, five days' previous notice being given to said marshal or

constable, to enter up judgment, instanter, against them, for the amount

so received, with interest and costs. Sec . 11. And be it further enacted, That where any judgment, before

any justice of the peace, shall have continued for more than one year,

Owner's oath, where goods, &c. have been purchased.

(a) The defendant was indicted for perjury in falsely taking and swearing the " owner's oath in cases
where goods have been actually purchased as prescribed by the fourth section of the supplementary collection law, of the first of March, 1823. The perjury was charged to have been committed in April, 1837, at the custom-house in New York, on the importation ofcertain woollen goods in the ship Sheridan. The indictment charged the defendant with having intentionally suppressed the true cost of the goods, with the intent to defraud the United States. 2. Charging the perjury in swearing to the truth of the invoice produced by him at the time of the entry of the goods, the invoice being false, &c. &c. It appeared by the evidence, that the goods mentioned in the entry had been bought by the defendant from John Wood, his father, of Saddleworth, England. No witness was produced by the United States to prove that the value or cost of the goods was greater than that for which they were entered at the custom-house in New York. The evidence of this, offered by the prosecution was, the invoice book of JTohn Wood, and thirty-five original letters from the defendant to John Wood, between 1834 and 1837, showing a combination between John Wood and the defendant to defraud the United States, by invoicing and entering goods at less than their actual cost; that this combination comprehended the goods
imported in the Sheridan ; and that the goods received by that ship had been entered by the defendant,

is master, from

; that

the said goods, wares, and merchandise, were not actually bought by me,

or by my agent, in the ordinary mode of bargain and sale, but that,

nevertheless, the invoice which I now produce, contains a just and faith-

ful valuation of the same, at their fair market value, including charges

of purchasing, carriages, bleaching, dyeing, dressing, finishing, putting

up, and packing, at the time or times, and place or places, when and

where procured for my account, (or for account of myself and part-

ners ;) that the said invoice contains also a just and faithful account of

all charges actually paid, and no other discount, drawback, or bounty,

but such as has been actually allowed on the said goods, wares, and

merchandise; that I do not know, nor believe in the existence, of any

invoice or bill of lading, other than those now produced by me, and that

they are in the state in which I actually received them. And I do further

solemnly and truly (swear or affirm) that I have not, in the said entry or

invoice, concealed or suppressed any thing whereby the United States

may be defrauded of any part of the duty lawfully due on the said goods,

wares, and merchandise, and that if, at any time hereafter, I discover

any error in the said invoice, or in the account now produced, of the

said goods, wares, and merchandise, or receive any other invoice of

the same, I will immediately make the same known to the collector of

this district. Sec . 5. And be it further enacted, That the ad valorem rates of
duty upon goods, wares, and merchandise, shall be estimated in the manner following: to the actual cost, if the same shall have been actually purchased, or the actual value, if the same shall have been procured otherwise than by purchase, at the time and place, when and where purchased or otherwise procured, or to the appraised value, if appraised, except in cases where goods are subjected to the penalty provided for in the thirteenth section of this act, shall be added all charges, except insurance; and, also, twenty per centum on the said cost or value, and charges, if imported from the Cape of Good Hope, or any place beyond that, or from beyond Cape Horn, or ten per centum if from any other

he knowing that they had cost more than the prices at which he had entered them. This evidence was objected to on the part of the defendant, as not competent proof to convict the defendant of the crime
of perjury ; and that if an inference of guilt could be derived from such proof, it was an inference from circumstances, not sufficient, as the best legal testimony, to warrant a conviction. Held, That in
order to a conviction, it was not necessary, on the part of the prosecution, to produce a living witness ; if the jury should believe, from the within testimony, that the defendant made a false and corrupt oath
when he entered the goods. The United States v. Wood, 14 Peters, 430. The cases in which a living witness to a corpus delicti of the defendant, in a prosecution for perjury,
may be dispensed with, are : all such where a person charged with a perjury by falsely swearing to a fact directly disproved by documentary or written testimony, springing from himself, with circumstances showing the corrupt intent: In cases where the perjury charged is contradicted by a public record, proved to have been well known to the defendant when he took the oath, the oath only proved to have been taken; in cases where the party is charged with taking an oath contrary to what he must necessarily have known to be the truth, and the false swearing can be proved by his own letters relating to the fact sworn to, or by other written testimony existing and being found in the possession of the defendant, and which has been treated by him as containing the evidence of the fact recited in it. Ibid.
The letters of the defendant, showing his knowledge of the actual cost of the goods which had been falsely entered by him, are the best evidence which can be given. This evidence is good under the general principle that a man's own acts, conduct, and declarations, when voluntary, are always admis-
sible in evidence against him. If the letters of the defendant showed that the invoice book of the vendor of the goods, containing an invoice of the goods enumerated in the invoice to which the defendant had sworn the owner's oath, in which book the goods were priced higher in the sale of them to the defendant, recognised the book as containing the true invoice, his admission supersedes the necessity of other proof to establish the real price given by him for the goods; and the letters and invoice book in connection preponderate against the oath taken by the defendant, making a living witness to the corpus delicti charged in the indictment, unnecessary.

States, 3 Howard, 197.

(a) Indictment for false swearing under the third section of the act of Congress of March 1, 1823 which declares, that " any person who shall swear or affirm falsely, touching the expenditure of public money, or in support of any claim against the United States, shall suffer as for wilful and corrupt perjury." The indictment charged the false swearing to be an affidavit made before a justice of the peace of Kentucky in support of a claim against the United States, under the act of July 5, 1832, ch. 173, to provide for liquidating and paying certain claims of the state of Virginia. By the Supreme Court--There is no statute of the United States which expressly authorizes any justice of the peace of the state, or any officer of the national government to administer an oath in support of any claim against the United States under the act of 1823. The United States v. Bailey, 9 Peters, 238.
The Secretary of the Treasury, in order to carry into effect the authority given to him, to liquidate and pay the claims referred to in the act of 1832, had established a regulation authorizing affidavits made before any justice of the peace of a state, to be received and considered in proof of claims under the act. By implication, he possessed the power to make such a regulation, and to allow such affidavits in proof of claims under the act of 1832. It was incidental to his duty and authority in settling claims under the act. When the oath is taken before a state or national magistrate, authorized to administer oaths in pursuance of any regulations prescribed by the Treasury Department, or in conformity with the practice of the Treasury Department, so that the affidavit would be admissible evidence at the Department in support of any claim against the United States, and the party swears falsely, the case is within the purview of the act of 1823. Ibid.
If a state magistrate shall administer an oath, under an act of Congress expressly giving him the power to do so, it would be a lawful oath, before one having competent authority, and as much so as if he had been specially appointed a commissioner under a law of the United States for that purpose, and such
an oath, administered under such circumstances, would be within the purview of the act of 1823. Ibid. The act of 1823 does not create or punish the crime of'perjury, technically considered. But it
creates a new and substantial offence of false swearing, and punishes it in the same manner as perjury. The oath, therefore, need not be administered in a judicial proceeding, or in a case in which the state
magistrate, under the state laws, had jurisdiction, so as to make the false swearing perjury. It would be sufficient, that it might be lawfully administered by the magistrate, and was not in violation of his official duty. Ibid.

exposed by said removal, the United States will furnish them with rations of corn, meat, and salt, for twelve months, commencing on the first day of February next; and they further agree to compensate those individuals who have been compelled to abandon improvements on lands, not embraced within the limits allotted, to the amount of four thousand five hundred dollars, to be distributed among the sufferers, in a ratio to each, proportional to the value of the improvements abandoned. The United States further agree to furnish a sum, not exceeding two thousand dollars, to be expended by their agent, to facilitate the transportation of the different tribes to the point of concentration designated.

Indians to prevent any fugitive slaves from taking shelter among them, &c.
A commissioner and surveyor to be appointed.

Art ic le IX. The undersigned chiefs and warriors, for themselves and tribes, having objected to their concentration within the limits de-
scribed in the second article of this treaty, under the impression that the said limits did not contain a sufficient quantity of good land to subsist them, and for no other reason : it is, therefore, expressly understood, between the United States and the aforesaid chiefs and warriors, that, should the country embraced in the said limits, upon examination by the Indian agent and the commissioner, or commissioners, to be appointed under the Sth article of this treaty, be by them considered insufficient for the support of the said Indian tribes; then the north line, as defined in the 2d article of this treaty, shall be removed so far north
as to embrace a sufficient quantity of good tillable land.

Grounds on which the objections of said tribes to certain lands are founded.

Art ic le X. The undersigned chiefs and warriors, for themselves and tribes, have expressed to the commissioners their unlimited confidence in their agent, Col. Gad Humphreys, and their interpreter, Stephen Richards, and, as an evidence of their gratitude for their services and humane treatment, and brotherly attentions to their wants, request that one mile square, embracing the improvements of Enehe Mathla, at Tallahassee (said improvements to be considered as the centre) be conveyed, in fee simple, as a present to Col. Gad Humphreys.--And they further request, that one mile square, at the Ochesee Bluffs, embracing Stephen Richard's field on said Bluffs, be conveyed in fee simple, as a present to said Stephen Richards.

Whereas Neo Mathla, John Blunt, Tuski Hajo, Mulatto King, Emathlochee, and Econchatimico, six of the principal Chiefs of the Florida Indians, and parties to the treaty to which this article has been annexed, have warmly appealed to the Commissioners for permission to remain in the district of country now inhabited by them; and, in consideration of their friendly disposition, and past services to the United States, it is, therefore, stipulated, between the United States and the aforesaid Chiefs, that the following reservations shall be surveyed, and marked by the Commissioner, or Commissioners, to be appointed under the Sth article of this Treaty: For the use of Nea Mathla and his connections, two miles square, embracing the Tuphulga village, on the waters of Rocky Comfort Creek.

It is further understood, between the parties, that this agreement is not intended to prohibit the voluntary removal, at any future period, of all or either of the aforesaid Chiefs and their connections, to the district of country south, allotted to the Florida Indians, by the second article of this Treaty, whenever either, or all may think proper to make such an election; the United States reserving the right of ordering, for any outrage or misconduct, the aforesaid Chiefs, or either of them, with their connections, within the district of country south, aforesaid.
