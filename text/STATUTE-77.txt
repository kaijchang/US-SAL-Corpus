Be it enacted hy the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, Tliat tliis Act may be cited as the "Feed Grain Act of 1963."
SEC. 2. Section 105 of the Agricultural Act of 1949, as amended, is amended--
(1) by changing the period at the end of subsection (a) to a colon and adding the following: '·'Provided, That in the case of any crop for which an acreage diversion program is in effect for feed grains, the level of price support for corn of such crop shall be at such level not less than 65 per centum or more than 90 per centum of the parity price therefor as the Secretary determines necessary to achieve the acreage reduction goal established by him for the crop.-'
(2) by adding the following new subsection (d) : " ( d ) The provision of this subsection shall be applicable with respect to the 1964 crop and the 1965 crop of feed grains if an acreage diversion program is in effect under section 16(h) of the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act, as amended. The Secretary shall require as a condition of eligibility for price support on the crop of any feed grain which is included in the acreage diversion program that the producer shall participate in the diversion program to the extent prescribed by the Secretary, and, if no diversion program is in effect for the 1964 crop or the 1965 crop, he may require as a condition of eligibility for price support on such crop of feed grains that the producer shall not exceed his feed grain base: Provided, That the Secretary may provide that no producer of malting barley shall be required as a condition of eligibility for price support for barley to participate in the acreage diversion program for feed grains if such producer has previously produced a malting variety of barley, plants barley only of an acceptable malting variety for harvest, does not knowingly devote an acreage on the farm to barley in excess of 110 per centum of the average acreage devoted on the farm to barley in 1959 and 1960, does not knowingly devote an acreage on the farm to corn and grain sorghums in excess of the average acreage devoted on the farm to corn and grain sorghums in 1959 and 1960, and does not devote any acreage devoted to the production of oats and rye in 1959 and 1960 to the production of wheat pursuant to the provisions of section 328 of the Food and Agriculture Act of 1962. Such portion of the support price for any feed grain included in the acreage diversion program as the Secretary determines desirable to assure that the benefits of the price support and diversion programs inure primarily to those producers who cooperate in reducing their acreages of feed grains shall be made available to producers through payments in kind. Such payments in kind shall be made on the number of bushels of such feed grain determined by multiplying the actual acreage of such feed grain planted on the farm for harvest by the adjusted average yield per acre. The base period used in determining such adjusted average yield shall be the same as that used for purposes of the acreage diversion program formulated under section 16(h) of the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act, as amended. The Secretary may make not to exceed 50 per centum of any payments hereunder to producers in advance of determination of performance. Such payments in kind shall be made through the issuance of negotiable certificates which the Commodity Credit Corporation shall

77 STAT. ]

PUBLIC LAW 88-26-MAY 20, 1963

redeem for feed grains (such feed grains to be valued by the Secretary at not less than the current support price minus that part of the current support price made available through payments in kind, plus reasonable carrying charges) and, notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Commodity Credit Corporation shall, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, assist the producer in the marketing of such certificates. In the case of any certificate not presented for redemption within thirty days of the date oif its issuance, reasonable costs of storage and other carrying charges, as determined by the Secretary, for the period beginning thirty days after its issuance and ending with the date of its presentation for redemption shall be deducted from the value of the certificate. The Secretary shall provide for the sharing of such certificates among the producers on the farm on the basis oi their respective shares in the croj) produced on the farm with respect to which such certificates are issued, or the proceeds therefrom. If the operator of the farm elects to participate in the acreage diversion program, price support for feed grains included in the program shall be made available to the producers on such farm only if such producers divert from the jjroduction of such feed grains in accordance with the provisions of such program an acreage on the farm equal to the number of acres which such operator agrees to divert, and the agreement shall so provide."

SEC. 3. Section 16 of the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allot- Acreage diver-

ment Act, as amended, is amended by adding the following new ^^°" programs.

subsection:
" ( h ) Notwithstanding any other provision of law-- "(1) F o r the 1D64 crop and the 1&65 crop of feed grains, if
the Secretary determines that the total supply of feed grains will, in the absence of an acreage diversion program, likely be excessive, taking into account the need for an adequate carryover to maintain reasonable and stable supplies and prices of feed grains and to meet any national emergency, he may formulate and carry out an acreage diversion program for feed grains, without regard to provisions which would be applicable to the regular agricultural conservation program, under which, subject to such terms and conditions as the Secretary determines, conservation payments in amounts determined by the Secretary to be fair and reasonable shall be made to producers who divert acreage from the production of feed grains to an approved conservation use and increase their average acreage of cropland devoted in 1959 and 1960 to designated soil-conserving crops or practices including summer fallow and idle land by an equal amount. Payments shall not be made in amounts in excess of 50 per centum of the estimated basic county support rate, including that part of the support price made available through payments in kind, on the normal production of the acreage diverted from the commodity on the farm based on its adjusted average yield per acre. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, the Secretary may permit such diverted acreage to be devoted to the production of guar, sesame, safflower, sunflower, castor beans, mustard seed, and flax, if he determines that such crops are not in surplus supply and will not be in surplus supply if permitted to be grown on the diverted acreage, subject to the condition that payment with respect to diverted acreage devoted to any such crop shall be at a rate determined by the Secretary to be fair and reasonable, taking into consideration the use of such acreage for the production of such crops, but in no event shall the payment exceed one-half the rate which would otherwise be applicable if such acreage were devoted to conservation uses,

and no price support shall be made available for the production of any such crop on such diverted acreage. The base period for the purpose of determining the adjusted average yield in the case of payments with respect to the 1964 crop shall be the four-year period 1959^1962, and in the case of payments with respect to the 1965 crop shall be the tive-year period 1959-1963. Ths term 'feed grains' means corn, grain sorghums, barley, and,
if for any crop the producer so requests for purposes of having acreage devoted to the production of wheat considered as devoted to the production of feed grains, pursuant to the provisions of sectiou 328 of the Food and Agriculture Act of 1962, the tenn
'feed grains" shall include oats and rye: Provided^ T^hat acreages of corn, grain sorghums, and barley shall not be planted in lieu of acreages of oats and rye: Provided fyrther. That the acreage devoted to the production of wheat shall not be considered as an acreage of feed grains for purposes of establishing the feed grain base acreage for the farm for subsequent crops. Such feed grain diversion program shall require the producer to take such measures as the Secretary may deem appropriate to keep such diverted acreage free from erosion, insects, weeds, and rodents. The acreage eligible for participation in the program shall be such acreage (not to exceed 50 per centum of the average acreage on the farm devoted to feed grains in the crop years 1959 and 1960 or twenty-five acres, whichever is greater) as the Secretary determines necessary to achieve the acreage reduction goal for the crop. Payments shall be made in kind. The average acreage of wheat produced on the farm during the crop years 1959, 1960, and 1961, pui-suant to the exemption provided Ill sectiou 335(f) of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938,
prior to its repeal by the Food and Agriculture Act of 1962, in
excess of the small farm base acreage for wheat established under section 335 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, as amended, shall be considered as an acreage of feed grains
produced in the crop years of 1959 and 1960 for purposes of establishing the feed grain base acreage for the farm, and the rate of payment for diverting such wheat shall be an amount determined by the Secretary to be fair and reasonable in relation to the rates of payment for diverting feed grains. The Secretary may make such adjustments in acreage and yields as he determines necessary to correct for abnormal factors affecting production, and to give due consideration to tillable acreage, croprotation practices, types of soil, soil and water conservation measures, and topography. To the extent that a producer proves the actual acreages and yields for the farm, such acreages and yields shall be used in making determinations. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection (Z) (1), the Secretary may, upon unanimous request of the State committee established pursuant to section 8(b) of the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act, as amended, adjust the feed grain bases
foi" farms within any State or county to the extent he determines such adjustment to be necessary in order to establish fair and equitable feed grain bases for farms within such State or county. The Secretary may make not to exceed 50 per centum of any payments to producers in advance of determination of performance: Provided^ That in no event shall the Secretary in the crop years 1964 or 1965 make payments to any producers under this section 16(h) and under section 105(d) of the Agricultural Act of 1949, as amended, in excess of 20 per centum of the fair market value of any acreage involved. Notwithstanding

77 STAT. ]

PUBLIC LAW 88-26-MAY 20, 1963

47

any other provision of this subsection (h) (1), barley shall not be included in the program for a proaucer of malting barley exempted pursuant to section 105(d) of the Agricultural Act of 1949 who participates only with respect to corn and grain sorghums and does not knowingly devote an acreage on the farm to barley in excess of 110 per centum of the average acreage devoted on the farm to barley in 1959 and 1960.
"(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, not to exceed 1 per centum of the estimated total feed grain bases for all farms in a State for any year may be reserved from the feed grain bases established for farms in the State for apportionment to farms on which there were no acreages devoted to feed grains in the crop years 1959 and 1960 on the basis of the following factors: Suitability of the land for the production of feed grains, the past experience of the farm operator in the production of feed grains, the extent to which the farm oj^erator is dependent on income from farming for his livelihood, the production of feed grains on other farms owned, operated, or controlled by the farm operator, and such other factors as the Secretary determines should be considered for the purpose of establishing fair and equitable feed ^rain bases. An acreage equal to the feed grain base so established for each farm shall be deemed to have been devoted to feed grains on the farm in each of the crop years 1959 and 1960 for purposes of this subsection except that producer's on such farm shall not be eligible for conservation payments for the first year for which the feed grain base is established.
"(3) There are hereby authorized to be appropriated such amounts as may be necessary to enable the Secretary to carry out this section 16(h).
" (4) The Secretary shall provide by regulations for the sharing of payments under this subsection among producers on the farm on a fair and equitable basis and in keeping with existing contracts.
"(5) Payments in kind shall be made through the issuance of negotiable certificates which the Commodity Credit Corporation shall redeem for feed grains and, notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Commodity Credit Corporation shall, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, assist the producer in the marketing of such certificates. In the case of any certificate not presented for redemption within thirty days of the date of its issuance, reasonable costs of storage and other carrying charges, as determined by the Secretary, for the period beginning thirt}^ days after its issuance and ending with the date of its presentation for redemption shall be deducted from the value of the certificate. Feed grains with which Commodity Credit Corporation redeems certificates pursuant to this paragraph shall be valued at not less than the current support price, minus that part of the current support price made available through payments in kind, plus reasonable carrying charges.
"(6) Xotwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretarj^ may, by mutual agreement with the producer, terminate or modify any agreement previously entered into pursuant to this subsection if he determines such action necessary because of an emergency created by drouglit or other disaster, or in order to prevent or alleviate a shortage in the supply of feed grains.''

Whereas Major General Benjamin D. Foulois (retired) enlisted in the Army Corps of Engineers on July 7, 1898, was suosequently commissioned as an officer in the Army, became associated with the aviation section of the Signal Corps of the Army in 1908, and qualified as a pilot in 1909; and
Whereas during the punitive expedition into Mexico in 1915 and 1916, he commanded the First Aero Squadron with that expedition; and
Whereas during World W a r I he served as Chief of the Air Services of the American Expeditionary Forces in France, was elevated to the post of Assistant Chief of the Air Corps in 1927, became Chief of the Army Air Corps in 1931, and continued in that assignment until his retirement as a major general on December 31,1935; and
Whereas Major Gjreneral Benjamin D. Foulois (retired), during his twenty-seven y^ars of commissioned service, played a major role in the development of the role of military air power and of the military department now having primary cognizance over military air power, the United States Air Force; and
Whereas General Foulois, now nearly eighty-four years of age, has devoted twenty-seven years in a retired status to the furtherance of aviation, which matches the twenty-seven years of his active commissioned service in behalf of aviation, and totals fifty-four years of uninterrupted dedication and service to the development of aviation; and

Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the Secretary of the Air Force is authorized to cause an appropriate medal to be struck, with suitable emblems, devices, and inscriptions, in recognition of more than fifty years of devoted service by Major General Benjamin D.

"1. In obeying and construing these Rules, any action taken should be positive, in ample time, and with due regard to the observance of good seamanship.
"2. Risk of collision can, when circumstances permit, be ascertained by carefully watching the compass bearing of an approaching vessel. If the bearing does not appreciably change, such risk should be deemed to exist.
"3. Mariners should bear in mind that seaplanes in the act of landing or taking off, or operating under adverse weather conditions, may be unable to change their intended action at the last moment.
"4. Rules 17 to 24 apply only to vessels in sight of one another.
"Rule 17
" ( a ) When two sailing vessels are approaching one another, so as to involve risk of collision, one of them shall keep out of the way of the other as follows--
"(i) When each has the wind on a different side, the vessel which has the wind on the port side shall keep out of the way of the other.
"(ii) When both have the wind on the same side, the vessel which is to windward shall keep out of the way of the vessel which is to leeward. "(b) For the purposes of this Rule the windward side phall be deemed to be the side opposite to that on which the mainsail is carried or, in the case of a square-rigged vessel, the side opposite to that on which the largest fore-and-aft sail is carried.
"Rule 18
"(a) When two power-driven vessels are meeting end on, or nearly end on, so as to involve risk of collision, each shall alter her course to starboard, so that each may pass on the port side of the other. This Rule only applies to cases where vessels are meeting end on, or nearly end on, in such a manner as to involve risk of collision, and does not apply to two vessels which must, if both keep on their respective course, pass clear of each other. The only cases to which it does apply

206

PUBLIC LAW 88-131-SEPT. 24, 1963

[77 STAT.

are when each of two vessels is end on, or nearly end on, to the other; in other words, to cases in which, by day, each vessel sees the masts of the other in a line, or nearly in a line, with her own; and by night, to cases in which each vessel is in such a position as to see both the sidelights of the other. It does not apply, by day, to cases in which a vessel sees another ahead crossing her own course; or, by night, to cases where the red light of one vessel is opposed to the red light of the other or where the green light of one vessel is opposed to the green light of the other or where a red light without a green light or a green light without a red light is seen ahead, or where both green and red lights are seen anywhere but ahead.
"(b) For the purposes of this Kule and Kules 19 to 29 inclusive, except Eule 20(c) and Eule 28, a seaplane on the water shall be deemed to be a vessel, and the expression 'power-driven vessel' shall be construed accordingly.
"Kule 19
"When two power-driven vessels are crossing, so as to involve risk of collision, the vessel which has the other on her own starboard side shall keep out of the way of the other.

"Eule 20
"(a) When a power-driven vessel and a sailing vessel are proceeding in such directions as to involve risk of collision, except as provided for in Eules 24 and 26, the power-driven vessel shall keep out of the way of the sailing vessel.
"(b) This Eule shall not give to a sailing vessel the right to hamper, in a narrow channel, the safe passage of a power-driven vessel which can navigate only inside such channel.
"(c) A seaplane on the water shall, in general, keep well clear of all vessels and avoid impeding their navigation. In circumstances, however, where risk of collision exists, she shall comply with these Eules.
"Eule 21
"Where by any of these Eules one of two vessels is to keep out of the way, the other shall keep her course and speed. When, from any cause, the latter vessel finds herself so close that collision cannot be avoided by the action of the giving-way vessel alone, she also shall take such action as will best aid to avert collision (see Eules 27 and 29).
"Eule 22
"Every vessel which is directed by these Eules to keep out of the way of another vessel shall, so far as possible, take positive early action to comply with this obligation, and shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, avoid crossing ahead of the other.

"Eule 23
"Every power-driven vessel which is directed by these Eules to keep out of the way of another vessel shall, on approaching her, if necessary, slacken her speed or stop or reverse.

"Kule 24
"(a) Notwithstanding anything contained in these Eules, every vessel overtaking any other shall keep out of the way of the overtaken vessel.

77 STAT. ]

PUBLIC LAW 88-131-SEPT. 24, 1963

207

"(b) Every vessel coming up with another vessel from any direction more than 221/^ degrees (2 points) abaft her beam, i.e., in such a position, with reference to the vessel which she is overtaking, that at night she would be unable to see either of that vessel's sidelights, shall be deemed to be an overtaking vessel; and no subsequent alteration of the bearing between the two vessels shall make the overtaking vessel a crossing vessel within the meaning of these Rules, or relieve her of the duty of keeping clear of the overtaken vessel until she is finally past and clear.
"(c) If the overtaking vessel cannot determine with certainty whether she is forward of or abaft this direction from the other vessel, she shall assume that she is an overtaking vessel and keep out of the way.
"Rule 25
"(a) In a narrow channel every power-driven vessel when proceeding along the course of the channel shall, when it is safe and practicable, keep to that side of the fairway or mid-channel which lies on the starboard side of such vessel.
"(b) Whenever a power-driven vessel is nearing a bend in a channel where a vessel approaching from the other direction cannot be seen, such power-driven vessel, when she shall have arrived within one-half (i^) mile of the bend, shall give a signal by one prolonged blast on her whistle which signal shall be answered by a similar blast given by any approaching power-driven vessel that may be within hearing around the bend. Regardless of whether an approaching vessel on the farther side of the bend is heard, such bend shall be rounded with alertness and caution.
"(c) In a narrow channel a power-driven vessel of less than 65 feet in length shall not hamper the safe passage of a vessel which can navigate only inside such channel.
"Rule 26
"All vessels not engaged in fishing, except vessels to which the provisions of Rule 4 apply, shall, when under way, keep out of the way of vessels engaged in fishing. This Rule shall not give to any vessel engaged in fishmg the right of obstructing a fairway used by vessels other than fishing vessels.
"Rule 27
"In obeying and construing these Rules due regard shall be had to all dangers of navigation and collision, and to any special circumstances, including the limitations of the craft involved, which may render a departure from the above Rules necessary in order to avoid immediate danger.

"PART E . -- S O U N D SIGNALS FOR VESSELS IN SIGHT OF O N E ANOTHER
"Rule 28
" ( a ) When vessels are in sight of one another, a power-driven vessel under way, in taking any course authorised or required by these Rules, shall indicate that course by the following signals on her whistle, namely--
"One short blast to mean 'I am altering my course to starboard'. "Two short blasts to mean 'I am altering my course to port'. "Three short blasts to mean 'My engines are going astern'. "(b) Whenever a power-driven vessel which, under these Rules, is to keep her course and speed, is in sight of another vessel and is in

208

PUBLIC LAW 88-131-SEPT. 24, 1963

[77 STAT.

doubt whether sufficient action is being taken b]^ the other vessel to avert collision, she may indicate such doubt by giving at least five short and rapid blasts on the whistle. The giving of such a signal shall not relieve a vessel of her obligations under Kules 27 and 29 or any other Rule, or of her duty to indicate any action taken under these Rules by giving the appropriate sound signals laid down in this Rule.
"(c) Any whistle signal mentioned in this Rule may be further indicated by a visual signal consisting of a white light visible all round the horizon at a distance of at least 5 miles, and so devised that it will operate simultaneously and in conjunction with the whistlesounding mechanism and remain lighted and visible during the same period as the sound signal.
" ( d ) Nothing in these Rules shall interfere with the operation of any special rules made by the Government of any nation with respect to the use of additional whistle signals between ships of war or vessels sailing under convoy.

"PART F.--MISCELLANEOUS
"Rule 29
"Nothing in these Rules shall exonerate any vessel, or the owner, master or crew thereof, from the consequences of any neglect to carry lights or signals, or of any neglect to Keep a proper look-out, or of the neglect of any precaution which may be required by the ordinary practice of seamen, or by the special circumstances of the case.

"Rule 30
"Reservation of Rules for Harbours and Inland Navigation
"Nothing in these Rules shall interfere with the operation of a special rule duly made by local authority relative to the navigation of any harbour, river, lake, or inland water, including a reserved seaplane area.
"Rule 31

"Distress Signals

"(a) When a vessel or seaplane on the water is in distress and

requires assistance from other vessels or from the shore, the follow-

ing shall be the signals to be used or displayed by her, either together

or separately, namely--

" ( i ) A gun or other explosive signal fired at intervals of about

a-minute.

"(ii) A continuous sounding with any fog-signalling appara-

tus.

"(iii) Rockets or shells, throwing red stars fired one at a time

at short intervals,

"(iv) A signal made by radiotelegraphy or by any other

signalling method consisting of the group . . .

...

in the Morse Code.

"(v) A signal sent by radiotelephony consisting of the spoken

word 'Mayday'.

"(vi) The International Code Signal of distress indicated by

N.C.

"(vii) A signal consisting of a square flag having above or

below it a ball or anything resembling a ball.

"(viii) Flames on the vessel (as from a burning tar barrel,

oil barrel, &c.).

77 STAT. ]

PUBLIC LAW 88-131-SEPT. 24, 1963

209

"(ix) A rocket parachute flare or a hand flare showing a red light.
" ( x ) A smoke signal giving off a volume of orange-coloured smoke.
"(xi) Slowly and repeatedly raising and lowering arms outstretched to each side. "NOTE.--Vessels in distress may use the radiotele^aph alarm signal or the radiotelephone alarm signal to secure attention to distress calls and messages. The radiotelegraph alarm signal, which is designed to actuate the radiotelegraph auto alarms of vessels so fitted, consists of a series of twelve dashes, sent in 1 minute, the duration of each dash being 4 seconds, and the duration of the interval between 2 consecutive dashes being 1 second. The radiotelephone alarm signal consists of 2 tones transmitted alternately over periods of from 30 seconds to 1 minute. "(b) The use of any of the foregoing signals, except for the purpose of indicating that a vessel or seaplane is in distress, and the use of any signals which may be confused with any of the above signals, is prohibited.
" A N N E X TO THE RULES

"RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE USE or RADAR INFORMATION AS AN AID TO
AVOIDING COLLISIONS AT SEA
"(1) Assumptions made on scanty information may be dangerous and should be avoided.
"(2) A vessel navigating with the aid of radar in restricted visibility must, in compliance with Rule 16(a), go at a moderate speed. Information obtained from the use of radar is one of the circumstances to be taken into account when determining moderate speed. In this regard it must be recognised that small vessels, small icebergs and similar floating objects may not be detected by radar. Radar indications of one or more vessels in the vicinity may mean that "moderate speed" should be slower than a mariner without radar might consider moderate in the circumstances.
"(3) When navigating in restricted visibility the radar range and bearing alone do not constitute ascertainment of the position of the other vessel under Rule 16(b) sufficiently to relieve a vessel of the duty to stop her engines and navigate with caution when a fog signal is heard forward of the beam.
"(4) When action has been taken under Rule 16(c) to avoid a close quarters situation, it is essential to make sure that such action is having the desired effect. Alterations of course or speed or both are matters as to which the mariner must be guided by the circumstances of the case.
"(5) Alteration of course alone may be the most effective action to avoid close quarters provided that--
" ( a ) There is sufficient sea room. "^b) It is made in good time. "(c) I t is substantial. A succession of small alterations of course should be avoided. " ( d ) I t does not result in a close quarters situation with other vessels. " (6) The direction of an alteration of course is a matter in which the mariner must be guided by the circumstances of the case. An alteration to starboard, particularly when vessels are approaching apparently on opposite or nearly opposite courses, is generally preferable to an alteration to port.

PUBLIC LAW 88-132-OCT. 2, 1963

[77 STAT.

"(7) An alteration of speed, either alone or in conjunction with an alteration of course, should be substantial. A number of small alterations of speed should be avoided.
"(8) If a close quarters situation is imminent, the most prudent action may be to take all way off the vessel."

1. To accomplish the purposes of this compact, as set forth in Article I, the following adjustments in the operation of irrigation facilities on Costilla Creek, and in the use of water diverted, stored and regulated thereby, are made:
(a) The quantity of water delivered for use in the two States by direct flow ditches in the Costilla-Garcia Area and by the Cerro Canal is based on a Duty of Water of one cubic foot per second of time for each eighty (80) acres, to be applied in the order of priority; Provided^ however^ That this adjustment in each instance is based on the acreage as determined by the court in decreeing the water rights for the Costilla-Garcia Area, and in
the case of the Cerro Canal such basis shall apj)ly to eight thousand (8,000) acres of land. I n order to better maintain a usable head for the diversion of water for beneficial consumptive use the adjusted maximum diversion rate under the water right of each of the ditches supplying water for the Costilla-Garcia Area in Colorado is not less than one cubic foot per second of time.
(b) There is transferred from certain ditches in the CostillaGarcia Area twenty-four and fifty-two hundredths (24.52) cubic feet per second of time of direct flow water rights, which rights of use are held by the Water Company or its successors in title, to the headgate of the Cerro Canal. The twenty-four and fifty-two hundredths (24.52) cubic feet of water per second of time hereby transferred represents an evaluation of these rights after adjustment in the Duty of Water, pursuant to subsection (a) of this Article, and includes a reduction thereof to compensate for increased use of direct flow water which otherwise would have been possible under these rights by this transfer.
(c) Except for the rights to store water from Costilla Creek in Eastdale Reservoir No. 1 as hereinafter provided, all diversion and storage rights from Costilla Creek for Eastdale Reservoirs No. 1 and No. 2 are relinquished and the water decreed thereunder is returned to the creek for use in accordance with the plan of integrated operation effectuated by this compact.
(d) The Cerro Canal direct flow permit shall be seventy-five and forty-eight hundredths (75.48) cubic feet per second of time.
(e) There is transferred to and made available for the irrigation of lands in Colorado a portion of the Costilla Reservoir complement of the Costilla Reservoir System Safe Yield in order that the storage of water in that reservoir may be made for the benefit of water users in both Colorado and New Mexico under the provisions of this compact for the allocations of water and the operation of facilities. 2. Each State grants for the benefit of the other and its water users the rights to change the points of diversion of water from Costilla Creek, to divert water from the stream in one State for use in the other and to store water in one State for the irrigation of lands in the other, insofar as the exercise of such rights may be necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Article and to comply with the terms of this compact. 3. The Water Company has consented to and approved the adjustments contained in this Article; and such consent and approval shall be evidenced in writing and filed with the Commission.

ARTICLE IV

The apportionment and allocation of the use of Costilla Cre^k water shall be as follows:
93-025 0-64-25

354

PUBLIC LAW 88-198-DEC. 12, 1963

[77 STAT.

(a) There is allocated for diversion from the natural flow of Costilla Creek and its tributaries sufficient water for beneficial use on meadow and pasture lands above Costilla Reservoir in New Mexico to the ext<»nt and in the manner now pi-evailini]: in that area.
(b) There is allocated for diversion from the natural flow of Costilla Creek and its tributaries thirteen and forty-two hundredths (13.42) cubic feet of water per second of time for beneficial use on lands in the Amalia Area in New Mexico.
(c) In addition to allocations made in subsections (e), (f) and (g) of this Article, there is allocated for diversion from the natural flow of Costilla Creek fifty and sixty-two hundredths (50.62) cubic feet of water per second of time for Colorado and eighty-nine and eight hundredths (89.08) cubic feet of water per second of time for New Mexico, subject to adjustment as provided in Article V(6), and such water shall be delivered for beneficial use in the two States in accordance with the schedules and under the conditions set forth in Article V.
(d) There is allocated for diversion from the natural flow of Costilla Creek sufficient water to provide each year one thousand (1,000) acre-feet of stored water in Eastdale Reservoir No. 1, such water to be delivered as provided in Article V.
(e) There is allocated for diversion to Colorado thirty-six and five-tenths per cent (36.5%) and to New Mexico sixty-three and five-tenths per cent (63.5%) of the water stored by Costilla Reservoir for release therefrom for irrigation purposes each year, subject to adjustment as provided in Article V(e) and such water shall be delivered for beneficial use in the two States on a parity basis in accordance with the provisions of Article V. By "parity basis" is meant that neither State shall enjoy a priority of right of use.
(f) There is allocated for beneficial use in each of the States of Colorado and New Mexico one-half of the Surplus "Water, as defined in Article 11 ( p ) , to be delivered as provided in Article V.
(g) There is allocated for beneficial use in each of the States of Colorado and New Mexico one-half of any water made available and usable by Additional Storage Facilities which may be constructed in the future.

ARTICLE V
The operation of the facilities of Costilla Creek and the delivery of water for the irrigation of land in Colorado and New Mexico, in accordance with the allocations made in Article IV, shall be as follows:
(a) Diversions of water for use on lands in the Amalia Area shall be made as set forth in Article I V (b) in the order of decreed priorities in New Mexico and of relative priority dates in the two States, subject to the right of New Mexico to change the points of diversion and places of use of any of such water to other points of diversion and places of use; Provided^ how^ver^ That the rights so transferred shall be limited in each instance to the quantity of water actually consumed on the lands from which the right is transferred.
(b) Deliveries to Colorado of direct flow water below the Canyon Mouth shall be made by New Mexico in accordance with the following schedule:

NOT INSURED OR INSURANCE INDEMNITY I S INSUFFICIENT.--^\^'^here the
building is not insured or where the insurance indemnity is insufficient to cover the cost of reconstruction the new building costs shall be paid by all the co-owners in the same proportion as their proportionate ownership of the common elements of the condominium project, and if any one or more of those composing the minority shall refuse to make such payments, the majority may proceed with the reconstruction at the expense of all the co-owners and the share of the resulting common expense may be assessed against all the co-owners and such assessment for this expense shall have the same priority as provided under section 17 of this Act.

(b) If the adoption occurred outside the District either before or after August 25,1937, upon filing with the Board of Commissioners a certified copy of the final decree of adoption, the Board shall cause to be made a new record of the birth in the new name and with the names of the adopters and shall then cause to be sealed and filed the original birth certificate with the certified copy of the final decree of adoption.

§ 16-502. Service of notice; publication

§ 16-^03. Attachment for debts not due
A creditor may maintain an action and have an attachment against his debtor's property and credits, where his debt is not yet due and payable, if the plaintiff, his agent, or attorney files in the clerk's office, at the commencement of the action, an affidavit, supported by testimony of one or more witnesses, showing the amount and justice of the claim and the time when it will be payable, and also setting forth that the defendant has removed or is removing or intends to remove a material part of his property from the District with the intent or to the effect of defeating just claims against him if only the ordinary process of law is used to obtain judgment against him, and if he also complies with the condition as to filing a bond prescribed by section 16-50L The plaintiff may not have judgment before his claim becomes due.

§ 16-505. Sufficiency of plaintiff's bond
The defendant or any other person interested in the proceedings who is not satisfied with the sufficiency of the surety or with the amount of the penalty named in the bond filed pursuant to section 16'501, may apply to the court for an order requiring the plaintiff to give an additional bond in such sum and with such security as may be approved by the court. If the plaintiff fails to comply with any such order the court may order the attachment to be quashed and any property attached or its proceeds to be returned to the defendant or otherwise disposed of, as to the court may seem proper.
§16-506. Traversins: affidavits; quashing writ of attachment; trial of issues

This issue may be tried by the court or a judge at chambers after thi'ee days' notice. The issue may be tried as well upon oral testimony as upon affidavits. If the court deems it expedient, a jury may be impaneled to try the issue.
§ 16-507. Property subject to attachment; liens; priorities

(Signed) EF. GH.

§16-510. Release of property or credits from attachment; sufficiency of undertaking
(a) Either the defendant or the person in whose possession the property is attached may obtain a release of the property from the attachment, after it has been taken into the custody of the marshal and the writ has been returned, by giving the undertaking required of him by section 16-509, with security to be approved by the court.
(b) The plaintiff may except to the sufficiency of the undertaking accepted by the marshal and, if the exceptions are sustained, the court shall require a new undertaking, with sufficient surety, by a dav to be named, in default of which the marshal shall be liable to the plaintiff on his official bond for any loss sustained by the plaintiff through the default.

§16-513. Advance payment of wages to avoid attachment or garnishment
It is unlawful for an employer to pay salary or earnings to an employee in advance of the time they are due and payable, for the purpose of avoiding or preventing an attachment or garnishment against the earnings or salary of the employee, and such an advance payment, as to the attaching creditor, is void.
After the service of one writ of attachment or garnishment on a judgment against an employer, any payment of salary or earnings thereafter before the time when the salary or earnings are due and payable made within a period of six months after the date of service of the writ or before the earlier satisfaction of the judgment, whichever is the earlier, is as to such attaching creditor presumed to be in violation of this section and casts upon the employer the burden of proving that the advance payment or payments were not for the purpose of avoiding the attachment of the salary or earnings.
§ 16-514. Credits or property held for two or more persons or in representative capacity
When a writ of attachment is served on a garnishee, and the garnishee holds a credit or property for two or more persons, including the person whose credit or property is sought to be attached, or holds a credit or property for a person as agent or trustee or in any other representative capacity without designation of the principal or beneficiary, the credit or property is not subject to withdrawal by any person, but shall be held by the garnishee until the attachment IS dismissed or otherwise disposed of by the court. If the credit or property is condemned, payment or delivery thereof as ordered by the court is a complete discharge of the garnishee from all liability to any person in respect of the credit or property. The provisions of this section do not apply to a credit or property of a partnership.
§16-515. Attachment of judgments and money or property in hands of marshal
(a) An attachment may be levied upon debts due to the defendant upon a judgment or decree by a service similar to that directed by section 16-511 upon the debtor owing the debts. Execution may issue for the enforcement of the judgment or decree, notwithstanding the attachment, but the money collected upon the execution shall be paid into court to abide the event of the proceedings in attachment and applied as the court directs.
(b) An attachment may be levied upon money or property of the defendant in the hands of the marshal. I t binds the money or property from the time of service, and is a legal excuse to the officer for not paying or delivering the same as he would otherwise be bound to do.

(2) both the claimant and his tenant, or other occupant claiming under him; or
(3) if the premises are not actually occupied, a person exercising acts of ownership thereon adversely to the plaintiff. When a lessee is made a defendant at the suit of a party claiming against the title of the lessee's landlord, the landlord may appear and be made a party defendant in the place of his lessee. Any person claiming to be in possession may, on motion, be admitted to defend the action.

§ 16-1102. Failure of tenant to give notice to landlord

(2) the defendant is wrongfully exercising acts of ownership over the premises. However, except as provided by this chapter, acts of ownership do not amount to an adversary possession, so as to make it necessary for the plaintiff to sue in order to avoid the bar of the statute of limitations.

§16-1106. Performance of contract by vendee as precluding vendor from recovery
Where real property has been sold under a written contract executed by the vendor, and there has been such a performance of its terms by the vendee as would entitle him to a decree for a conveyance of the legal title, without condition, the vendor may not recover the property from the vendee.
§ 16-1107. Several judgments against defendants occupying distinct parcels
When it appears on the trial in an action of ejectment that some of the defendants occupy distinct parcels of the property claimed, in severalty, the plaintiff, if entitled to recover, may in the discretion of the court, have several judgments against the respective parties, according to the proof of occupancy.

§ 16-1360. Trial; evidence; measure of compensation
After the inspection provided for by section 16-1359, and the jury has returned to the court, the trial of tne cause shall be proceeded with before the court and jury. Any person who has appeared in the cause claiming any right, title, interest, or estate in the land to be taken, or compensation on account of its taking, has the right to submit evidence concerning the vaJue of the property, parcel by parcel, the nature and extent of his right, interest, or estate therein, and the compensation justly due for the taking of the property. A new structure or substantial alteration of a permanent nature, the purpose or natural effect of which is to enhance the value of the property to be taken, erected, or made thereon after the institution of the condenmation proceedings may not be taken into consideration in assessing and awarding compensation for the property. When the property to be valued has been taken by virtue of a declaration of taking, as provided by section 16-1353, it shall be valued for the purposes of compensation as of the date of the taking. When, by act of the owner or other party claiming to be entitled to compensation, the value of the property for the use for which it is to be taken has been diminished, as by cutting trees, excavating, grading, or otherwise altering its physical condition, allowance, if the plaintiff so elects, shall be made in accessing compensation for the diminution in value.
§ 16-1361. Verdict
At the close of the evidence in a proceeding pursuant to this subchapter, the court shall charge the jury and furnish them with a written form to be used in returning their verdict. The members of the jury may separate when not en^ged in the consideration of their verdict. When the jury, or a majority thereof, have agreed upon their verdict they shall, through their foreman, so notify the court, which shall thereupon pass an order setting a day for the return of the verdict in open court. The verdict shall oe in writing subscribed by the jurors concurring therein, and shall set forth, parcel by parcel, the compensation to be paid for the taking of the lands to be condemned.

§ 16-1362. Fixing date for new t r i a l ; new jurors
If a verdict rendered pursuant to section 16-1361, or any award contained therein, is set aside or vacated, the court shall--
(1) grant a new trial with respect to the property as to which the verdict or award is set aside or vacated;
(2) fix a date for the new trial; and (3) order a new panel of prospective jurors to be drawn, certified, or summoned as provided by section 16-1357. The court shall tlien proceed with the cause as if a verdict or award had not been rendered.
§ 16-1363. Judgment
Judgment upon a verdict returned pursuant to section 16-1361 or any award contained therein shall be entered against the United States in favor of the parties entitled for the sums awarded as just compensation, respectively, for the property condemned for the use of the United States.
§ 16-1364. Force and effect of j u d g m e n t ; payment
A final judgment rendered against the United States pursuant to this subchapter has like force and effect as a money judgment rendered against the United States by the Court of Claims in a suit in respect of which the United States has expresslj^ consented to be sued. The amount of the final judgment shall be paid out of any specific appropriation applicable to the case. If a specific appropriation does not exist, the judgment shall be paid in the same manner (except with respect to interest) as judgments rendered by the Court of Claims in cases under its general jurisdiction.
§16-1365. Appeal; deficiency judgment
A party aggrieved by a final judgment in a proceeding pursuant to this subchapter may appeal therefrom to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The appeal, or any bond or undertaking given therein, does not operate to prevent or delay the vesting of title to the property in the United States, but upon the filing of a declaration of taking, or, if a declaration of taking is not filed, upon payment to the party entitled, or deposit in the registry of the court, of the amount awarded by the judgment, title vests in the United States, saving to all parties their right to just compensation. If the compensation finally awarded and adjudged for the property exceeds the amount awarded and adjudged by the judgment appealed from, the court shall enter judgment for the deficiency with interest as provided by this subchapter.
§ 16-1366. Payment of compensation into court; vesting of title
Payment into the registry of the court for the use of the parties entitled of the sum adjudged to be just compensation for the property to be condemned and taken, or for any parcel thereof, or any interest therein, pursuant to this subchapter, constitutes payment of the compensation. Upon the payment, the plaintiff is entitled to an order declaring that the title to the property in respect of which the compensation is so paid is vested in the United States of America. The money so paid into the registry of the court shall be deemed to be vested in the persons owning or interested in the property, according to their respective estates and interest, and the money shall take the place and stand in lieu of the property condemned. The court, upon the application of the plaintiff or of any party in interest, may determine and direct who is entitled to receive payment of the money so paid into the registry, and, in its discretion, order a reference to the auditor of the court or a special master to ascertain the facts on which the determination and direction are to be made.

(1) the persons are partners or joint contractors; (2) the contract is under seal or not; (3) it is written or verbal; or (4) it is expressed to be joint and several or not-- is deemed to be joint and several.

§ 16-2102. Death of party to the contract

(1) all the parties thereto, but service of process is had on some, only, of the defendants; or

When practicable, the in-

77 STAT. ]

PUBLIC LAW 88-241-DEC. 23, 1963

quiry shall include a preliminary investigation of the home and

environmental situation of the child, his previous history, and the

circumstances that were the subject of the information. ^Vhen the

Director of Social Work Hnds that jurisdiction should be acquired,

he shall, after consultation with and approval by the corporation

counsel or his assistant assigned to the court, authorize a petition to

be filed. "Wliere the Director fails so to find, the person giving infor-

mation to the Director may present the facts to the corporation counsel

or his assistant, who, after investigation by an oflSicer of the court as

herein provided, may authorize a petition to be filed. The proceedings

shall be entitled, " I n the matter of

, a child under eighteen

years of age."

The petition shall be verified by the officer making the investiga-

tion, or other person having personal knowledge of the case, and shall

allege briefly the facts which bring the child within the provisions

of section 11-1551, and shall state the name, age, and residence of

(1) the child;

(2) his parents;

(3) his legal guardian, if there be one;

(4) the person or persons having custody or control of the

child; and

(5) the nearest known relative, if no parent or guardian

can be found.

When any of the facts herein required are not known by the petitioner

the petition shall so state.

§16-2303. Summons; notice; custody of child

After a petition has been filed pursuant to section 16-2302, unless the parties hereinafter named voluntarily appear, the court shall issue a summons reciting briefly the substance of the petition, and requiring the person or persons who have custody or control of the child to appear personally and bring the child before the court at a time and place stated. Where the person so summoned is other than the parent or guardian of the child, the parent or guardian or both shall also be notified of the pendency of the case and of the time and place appointed, by personal service before the hearing, except as hereinafter provided. If the child is married, the other spouse shall also be so notified. Summons may be issued requiring the appearance of any other person whose presence is necessary.
Where it appears that the child is in such condition or surroundings that his welfare requires that his custody be immediately assumed by the court, the court may cause to be endorsed upon the summons an order that the officer serving it shall at once take the child into custody.

§ 16-2304. Service of summons; time of hearing

Service of summons issued pursuant to section 16-2303 shall be made personally by the delivery of a true and attested copy to the
Eerson summoned. Where reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have een made to make personal service of summons or notice and it appears that it is impracticable to do so, the court may order service of summons or notice by re^stered mail to the last-known address or by publication, or both, as it deems necessary. I t is sufficient to confer jurisdiction if service is effected at any time before the date fixed in the summons for the return thereof, but, on request of the parent or guardian or person having custody of the child, the hearing on the petition may not take place until three days after service of the summons. ^
The United States marshal for the District of Columbia or his deputy shall execute the orders and processes of the Court in the same manner as he executes those of the United States District Court for

§ 16-2305. Failure to obey summons; contempt; warrant
When a person summoned as provided by sections 16-2303 and 162304, without reasonable cause, fails to appear, he may be proceeded against for contempt of court. When the summons can not be served, or the parties served fail to obey it, or the welfare of the child requires that he be brought forthwith into the custody of the court, a warrant may be issued against the parent or guardian or against the child himself.
§ 16-2306. Taking child into custody; release to custody of parent, guardian, custodian, or probation officer; limitation on detention
(a) When an officer takes a child into custody, he shall, unless it is impracticable or has been otherwise ordered by the court, accept the written promise of the parent, guardian, or custodian to bring the child to the court at the time fixed. Thereupon, the child may be released in the custody of a parent, guardian, or custodian. If not so released, the child shall be placed in the custody of a probation officer or other person designated by the court, or taken inimediately to the court or to a place of detention provided by the Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia or its authorized representative, and the officer taking him shall immediately notify the court and shall file a petition when directed to do so by the court.
(b) A child whose custody has been assumed by the court may, pending final disposition of the case, be released by the court in the custody of a parent, guardian, or custodian, or of a probation officer or other person appointed by the court, to be brought before the court at the time designated. WTien not released as herein provided, the child, pending the hearing of the case, shall be detained in a place of detention provided by the Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia or its authorized representative, subject to further order of the court.
(c) This subchapter does not forbid a peace officer, police officer, or probation officer from immediately taking into custody a child:
(1) who is found violating a law or ordinance; or (2) who is reasonably beheved to be a fugitive from his parents or from justice; or (3) whose surroundings are such as to endanger his health, morals, or safety, unless immediate action is taken. I n a case specified by this subsection, the officer taking the child into custody shall immediately report the fact to the court and the case shall then be proceeded with as provided by this subchapter and chapter 15 of Title 11. A child so taken into custody may not be held in a place of detention for a period longer than five days, excluding Sundays and holidays, unless the court orders him detained for a further period.
§ 16-2307. Hearing; exclusion of public; jury trial
The court may conduct a hearing pursuant to this subchapter in an informal manner, and may adjourn the^ hearing from time to time. The general public shall be excluded from the hearing and only such persons as have a direct interest in the case and their representatives may be admitted except that the judge presiding at the hearing, by rule of court or special order, may admit such other persons as he deems to have a legitimate interest in the case or the work of the court.

mine all cases of children without a jury unless a jury is demanded by the child, his parent, guardian, or the court.
§ 16-2308. Determination and order of the Court
(a) When the court finds that the child comes within the provisions of this subchapter and section 11-1551, it may by order duly entered:
(1) place the child on probation or under supervision in his own home or in the custody of a relative or other fit person, upon such terms as the court determines;
(2) commit the child to the Bbard of Commissioners of the District of Columbia or its authorized representative; or to the National Training School for Boys if in need of such care as is given in the school; or to a qualified suitable private institution or agency willing and able to assume the education, care, and maintenance of the child without expense to the public; or
(3) make such further disposition of the child as may be provided by law and as the court deems to be best for the best interests of the child. Paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subsection do not authorize the removal of the child from the custody of his parents unless his welfare and the safety and protection of the public can not be adequately safeguarded without the removal.
(b) In committing a child to custody other than that of its parent, the court may, after giving the parent a reasonable opportunity to be heard, adjudge that the parent shall pay in such manner as the court directs a sum that will cover in whole or in part the support of the child. If the parent willfully fails or refuses to pay the sum, he may be proceeded against as provided by law for cases of desertion or tailure to provide subsistence.
(c) When the court commits a child to an institution or agency, it shall transmit with the order of commitment a summary of its information concerning the child.
(d) An adjudication upon the status of a child in the jurisdiction of the court does not operate to impose any of the civil disabilities ordinarily imposed by conviction, and a child is not deemed a criminal by reason of an adjudication. An adjudication is not deemed a conviction of a crime, and a child may not be charged with or convicted of a crime in any court, except as provided by section 11-1553. The disposition made of a child, or evidence given in the court, is not admissible as evidence against the child in any case or proceeding in any other court, and the disposition, or evidence, or adjudication, does not operate to disqualify a child in any future civil-service examination, appointment, or application for public service under either the Government of the United States or of the District of Columbia.
§ 16-2309. Modification or revocation of order; petition; return of child, or other action
An order of commitment or probation made by the court in the case of a child may be modified or revoked by the court from time to time.
A parent, guardian, or next friend of a child who has been committed by the court to the custody of an institution, agency, or person, may at any time file with the court a verified petition, making application for modification or revocation of an order of commitment or probation, stating that the institution, agency, or person has denied application for the release of the child or has failed to act upon the application within a reasonable time. When the court is of the opinion that an investigation should be had, it may, upon due notice to all concerned, proceed to hear and determine the question at issue. I t may

thereupon order that the child be restored to the custody of its parent or guardian, or be retained in the custody of the institution, agency, or person; and may direct the institution, agency, or person to make such other arrangements for the child's care and welfare as the circumstances of the case require; or the court may make a further order or commitment.
§ 16-2310. Appointment of g u a r d i a n ; custody as between parents
When in the course of a proceeding instituted pursuant to this subchapter it appears to the court that the welfare of a child will be promoted by the appointment of a relative or other suitable individual as guardian of its person, when the child is not committed to an institution or to the custody of an incorporated society, the court has jurisdiction to make the appointment either upon the application of the child or some relative or next friend or upon the court's own motion. The court may issue an order to show cause, which shall be served upon the parent or parents or custodian of the child in such manner and for such time prior to the hearing as the court deems reasonable. In a case arising pursuant to this subchapter, the court may also determine as between parents whether the father or the mother shall have the custody and control of the child.
§ 16-2311. Protection of religious affiliations
In placing a child under guardianship or custody other than that of its parent, the court, when practicable, shall select a person, or an institution or agency governed by persons, of like religious faith as that of the parents of the child, or in case of a difference in the religious faith of the parents, then of the religious faith of the child, or if the religious faith of the child is not ascertained, then of either of the parents.
§ 16-2312. Physical and mental examinations of children
The court may cause a child coming under its jurisdiction to be examined by a physician, psychiatrist, or psychologist appointed by it.
§ 16-2313. Place of detention of children
(a) Except as provided by subsection (b) of this section, a child may not be placed in or committed to any prison, jail, or lockup, or be taken into custody, detained, or transferred from place to place, where he may be brought in contact or communication with an adult convicted of crime or under arrest and charged with crime.
(b) A child 16 years of age or older, whose habits or conduct are deemed such as to constitute a menace to other children, may, with the consent of a judge or Director of Social Work, be placed in a jail or other place of detention for adults, but in a room or ward separate from adults.
(c) The Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia or its authorized representative shall make adequate provision for the temporary detention of children within its jurisdiction in a detention home or in boarding homes selected for the purpose.
§ 16-2314. Applicability to adult cases; offenses and penalties; jury trial
(a) All provisions of this subchapter relative to procedure in cases of children so far as practicable apply also to cases against adults arising under section 11-1551, 11-1554, 11-1555, or 11-1556, or any of the sections referred to in section 11-1557, with the consent of the defendant, or when not inconsistent with other provisions of law relating to the conduct of adult cases. Proceedings may be instituted upon complaint of an interested party or upon the court's own motion, and a reasonable opportunity to appear shall be afforded the respondent.

Upon the trial, the court may impose such sentence as the law provides, or may suspend sentence and place on probation, and by order impose upon the adult such duty as is deemed to be for the best interests of the child or other persons concerned. If an adult is charged with an offense for which he is entitled to a trial by jury, he shall be so tried unless he expressly waives his right to jury trial.
§ 16-2315. Finality of judgments
Except as provided bjr sections 11-741 (a) (3), 11-741 ( b ) , 17-305 ( a ) , 17-306 and 17-307(a), in all cases tried before the court pursuant to this subchapter, the judgment of the court is final.

(1) the child shall receive such care and guidance, preferably in his own home, as will serve his welfare and the best interests of the District; and
(2) the child's family ties shall be conserved and strengthened whenever possible, and, except when his welfare or the safety and protection of the public can not be adequately safeguarded without his removal, he may not be removed from the custody of his parents; and
(3) when the child is removed from his own family, the court shall secure for him custody, care, and discipline as nearly as possible equivalent to that which should have been given him by his parents.

(f) The foregoing verification entitles the plaintiff to a judgment by default, without further proof, upon failure of defendant to appear, if the claim of the plaintiff is for a liquidated amount. If the amount is unliquidated, the plaintiff shall be required to present proof of his claim.
(g) The clerk shall furnish the plaintiff with a memorandum of the day and hour set for the hearing, not less than 5 nor more than 15 days from the date of the filing of the action. Where, in a case controlled by another statute, a greater or lesser time for hearing is specified by the other statute, that specified time is controlling. All actions filed in the Branch shall be made returnable therein.
§ 16-3903. Fees and costs; waiver
The fee for issuing summons and copies, trial, judgment, and satisfaction in an action in the Small Claims and Conciliation Branch of the District of Columbia Court of General Sessions shall be not more than $1. Other fees shall be as the court prescribes. The judge sitting in the Branch may waive the prepayment of costs or the payment of costs accruing during the action upon the sworn statement of the plaintiff or upon other satisfactory evidence of his inability to pay the costs. When costs are so waived the notation to be made on the records of the Branch shall be "Prepayment of costs waived," or "Costs waived." The term "pauper" or "in forma pauperis" may not be employed in the Branch. If a party fails to pay accrued costs, though able to do so, the judge may deny him the right to file a new case in the Branch while the costs remain unpaid, and likewise deny him the right to proceed further in any case pending in the Branch.
§ 16-3904. Set-off or counterclaim; pleading; retention of jurisdiction
If the defendant, in an action pursuant to this chapter, asserts a setoff or counterclaim, the judge may require a formal plea of set-off to be filed, or may waive the requirement. If the plaintiff requires time to prepare his defense against the counterclaim or set-off, the judge may continue the case for that purpose. When the set-off or counterclaim is for more than the jurisdictional limit of the Small Claims and Conciliation Branch as provided by section 11-1341 but within the jurisdictional limit of the court as provided by section 11-961, the action shall nevertheless remain in the Branch and be tried therein in its entirety.
§ 16-3905. Jury trial; demand; assignment to regular branch
I n a case filed or pending in the Small Claims and Conciliation Branch of the District of Columbia Court of General Sessions in which a party entitled to a trial by jury files a demand therefor, the case shall be assigned to and tried in the regular branch of the civil division of the Court under the procedure provided for jury trials.
§ 16-3906. Pre-trial settlement; t r i a l ; procedure; default; dismissal or nonsuit; other disposition
(a) On the return day specified by subsection (g) of section 16-3902, or at such later time as the judge sets, the trial shall be had. Immediately prior to the trial of a case pursuant to this chapter, the judge shall make an earnest effort to settle the controversy by conciliation. If he fails to induce the parties to settle their differences without a trial, he shall proceed with the hearing on the merits pursuant to subsection (b) of this section.
(b) Tlie parties and witnesses shall be sworn. The judge shall conduct the trial in such manner as to do substantial justice netween the parties according to the rules of substantive law, and is not bound by the statutory provisions or rules of practice, procedure, pleading, or evidence, except provisions relating to privileged communications.

(c) If the defendant fails to appear, judgment shall be entered for the plaintiff by default as provided by section 16-3902(f), or under rules of court, or on ex-parte proof. If the plaintiff fails to appear, the action may be dismissed for want of prosecution, or a nonsuit may be ordered, or defendant may proceed to a trial on the merits, or the case may be continued or returned to the files for further proceedings on a later date, as the judge directs. If both parties fail to appear, the judge may return the case to the files, or order the action dismissed for want of prosecution, or make any other just and proper disposition thereof, as justice requires.
§ 16-3907. Judgment; stay; installment payments; enforcement
Wlien judgment is to be rendered in an action pursuant to this chapter and the party against whom it is to be entered requests it, the judge shall inquire fully into his earnings and financial status and may stay the entry of judgment, and stay execution, except in cases involving wage claims, and order partial payments in such amounts, over such j)eriods, and upon such terms, as seems just in the circumstances and as will assure a definite and steady reduction of the judgment until it is finally and completely satisfiea. Upon a showing that the party has failed to meet an instalment payment without just excuse, the stay of execution shall be vacated. When a stay of execution has not been ordered or when a stay of execution has been vacated as provided by this section, the party in whose favor the judgment has been entered may avail himself of all remedies otherwise available in the District of Columbia Court of General Sessions for the enforcement of the judgment.
§ 16-3908. Judgment for wages; oral examination; payment
When a judgment rendered in an action pursuant to this chapter is founded in whole or in part on a claim for wages or personal services, the judge shall, upon motion of the party obtaining judgment, order the appearance of the party against whom the judgment has been entered, but not more often than once each week for four weeks, for oral examination under oath as to his financial status and his ability to pay the judgment, and the judge shall make such supplementary orders as seems just and proper to effectuate the payment of the judgment upon reasonable terms.
§ 16-3909. Award of costs
I n an action pursuant to this chapter, the award of costs is in the discretion of the judge, who may include therein the reasonable cost of bonds and undertakings, and other reasonable expenses incident to the action, incurred by either party.
§ 16-3910. Other rights of judgment creditor
Except as otherwise provided by this chapter, or in the rules prescribed pursuant to section 13-101 (c), a party obtaining a judgment in the Small Claims and Conciliation Branch of the District of Columbia Court of General Sessions is entitled to the same remedies, processes, costs, and benefits as are given or inure to other judgment creditors in the court.

If he fails to do so by a day named, the court may remove him from his office or trust and appoint a new trustee or other officer in his stead to complete the duties of his office or trust, and may thereupon, order him to deliver over to his successor all the trust property, including moneys, books, papers, bonds, notes, and evidences of debt, and may compel compliance with the order by attachment.
§ 16-4102. Subrogation of surety satisfsing judgment
Where a person recovers a judgment or money decree against the principal debtor and a surety or indorser, and the judgment is satisfied by the surety or indorser, the latter may have the judgment or money decree entered by the clerk to his use and have execution in his own name against the principal, and where a judgment or money decree is rendered against several sureties and one of tnem satisfies the whole debt, the surety satisfying the judgment may have the judgment or decree entered to his use, have execution against each of the other sureties in the judgment or decree for a proportionate part of the debt so paid by him. On the motion of the surety so paying the entire debt and notice to the other sureties, the court may determine for what amount execution shall issue against each of the other sureties.

614

It may not require that the record or briefs on appeal be printed. If they are printed, the cost of printing may not be taxed as costs in the case.
§ 17-303. Appeals from administrative orders and decisions; petition; record; procedure
(a) An appeal from an order or decision of an administrative agency, as provided for by section 11-742, is commenced by filing in the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, within the time prescribed pursuant to section 17-307(a), the written petition for review provided by section 11-742 (c).

lege, or immunity;

(C) in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or

limitation, or short of statutory right;

(D) without observance of procedure required by law;

(E) unsupported by substantial evidence or facts in

the record of the proceedings before the court; or

A term providing that one party or his successor in interest may accelerate payment or performance or require collateral or additional collateral ' a t will" or ''when he deems himself insecure" or in words of similar import shall be construed to mean that he shall have power to do so only if he in good faith believes that the prospect of payment or performance is impaired.

(4) In addition article 1 contains general definitions and principles of construction and interpretation applicable throughout this article.
§28:2--104. Definitions: "merchant"; "between merchants"; "financing agency"
(1) "Merchant" means a person who deals in goods of the kind or otherwise by his occupation holds himself out as having knowledge or skill peculiar to the practices or goods involved in the transaction or to whom such knowledge or skill may be attributed by his employment of an agent or broker or other intermediary who by his occupation holds himself out as having such knowledge or skill.
(2) "Financing agency" means a bank, finance company or other person who in the ordinary course of business makes advances against goods or documents of title or who by arrangement with either the seller or the buyer intervenes in ordinary course to make or collect payment due or claimed under the contract for sale, as by purchasing or paying the seller's draft or making advances against it or by merely taking it for collection whether or not documents of title accompany the draft. "Financing agency" includes also a bank or other person who similarly intervenes between persons who are in the position of seller and buyer in respect to the goods (section 28:2--707).

77 STAT. ]

PUBLIC LAW 88-243-DEC. 30, 1963

641

(2) Goods must be both existing and identified before any interest in tlieni can pass. Goods which are not both existing and identified are "future" goods. A purported present sale of future goods or of any interest therein operates as a contract to sell.
(3) There may be a sale of a part interest in existing identified goods. (4) An undivided share in an identified bulk of fungible goods is sufficiently identified to be sold although the quantity of the bulk is not determined. Any agreed proportion of such a bulk or any quantity thereof agreed upon by niunber, weight or other measure may to the extent of the seller's interest in the bulk be sold to the buyer who then becomes an owner in common. (5) "Lot" means a parcel or a single article which is the subject matter of a separate sale or delivery, whether or not it is sufficient to perform the contract. (6) "Commercial unit" means such a unit of goods as by commercial usage is a single whole for purposes of sale and division of which materially impairs its character or value on the market or in use. A (Commercial unit may be a single article (as a machine) or a set of articles (as a suite of furniture or an assortment of sizes) or a quantity (as a bale, gross, or carload) or any other unit treated in use or in the relevant market as a single whole.
§28:2--106. Definitions: "contract"; "agreement"; "contract for sale"; "sale"; "present sale"; "conforming" to contract; "termination"; "cancellation"
(1) In this article unless the context otherwise requires "contract" and "agreement" are limited to those relating to the present or future sale of goods. "Contract for sale" includes both a present sale of goods and a contract to sell goods at a future time. A "sale" consists in the passing of title from the seller to the buyer for a price (section 28: 2--401). A "present sale" means a sale which is accomplished by the making of the contract.
(2) Goods or conduct including any part of a performance are "conforming" or conform-to the contract when they are in accordance with the obligations under the contract.
(3) "Termination" occurs when either party pursuant to a power created by agreement or law puts an end to the contract otherwise than for its breach. On "termination" all obligations which are still executory on both sides are discharged but any right based on prior breach or performance survives.
(4) "Cancellation" occurs when either party puts an end to the contract for breach by the other and its effect is the same as that of "tei-mination" except that the cancelling party also retains any remedy for breach of the whole contract or any unperformed balance.
§ 28:2--107. Goods to be severed from realty: recording
(1) A contract for the sale of timber, minerals or the like or a structure or its materials to be removed from realty is a contract for the sale of goods within this article if they are to be severed by the seller but until severance a purported present sale thereof which is not effective as a transfer of tin interest in land is effective only as a contract to sell.

(3) The provisions of this section are subject to any third party rights provided by the law relating to realty records, and the contract for sale may be executed and recorded as a document transferring an interest in land and shall then constitute notice to third parties of the buyer's rights under the contract for sale.
PART 2--FORM, FORMATION AND READJUSTMENT OF
CONTRACT
§28:2--^201. Formal requirements; statute of frauds
(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section a contract for the sale of goods for the price of $500 or more is not enforceable by way of action or defense imless there is some writing sufficient to indicate that a contract for sale has been made between the parties and signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought or by his authorized agent or broker. A writing is not insufficient because it omits or incorrectly states a term agreed upon but the contract is not enforceable under this paragraph beyond the quantity of goods shown in such writing.
(2) Between merchants if within a reasonable time a writing in confirmation of the contract and sufficient against the sender is received and the party receiving it has reason to know its contents, it satisfies the requirements of subsection (1) against such party unless written notice of objection to its contents is given within ten days after it is received.
(3) A contract which does not satisfy the requirements of subsection (1) but which is valid in other respects is enforceable.
(a) if the goods are to be specially manufactured for the buyer and are not suitable for sale to others in the ordinary course of the seller's business and the seller, before notice of repudiation is i-eceived and under circumstances which reasonably indicfCte that the goods are for the buyer, has made either a substantial beginning of their manufacture or commitments for their procurement; or
(b) if the party against whom enforcement is sought admits in liis pleading, testimony or otherwise in court that a contract for sale was made, but the contract is not enforceable under this provision beyond the quantity of goods admitted; or
(c) with respect to goods for which payment has been made and accepted or which have been received and accepted (section 28:2--606).
§28:2--^202. Final written expression: parol or extrinsic evidence
Terms with respect to which the confirmatory memoranda of the parties agree or which are otherwise set forth in a writing intended by the parties as a final expression of their agreement with respect to such terms as are included therein may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior agreement or of a contemporaneous oral agreement but may be explained or supplemented
(a) by course of dealing or usage of trade (section 28:1--205) or by course of performance (section 28 :2--208); and
(D) by evidence of consistent additional terms unless the court finds the writing to have been intended also as a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement.
§ 28:2--203. Seals inoperative
The affixing of a seal to a writing evidencing a contract for sale or an offer to buy or sell goods does not constitute the writing a sealed instrument and the law with respect to sealed instruments does not apply to such a contract or offer.

§28:2--204. Formation in general
(1) A contract for sale of goods may be made in any manner sufficient to show agreement, including conduct by both parties which recognizes the existence of such a contract.
(2) A n agreement sufficient to constitute a contract for sale may be found even though the moment of its making is undetermined.
(3) Even though one or more terms are left open a contract for sale does not fail for indefiniteness if the parties have intended to make a contract and there is a reasonably certain basis for giving an appropriate remedy.
§28:2--205. Firm offers
An offer by a merchant to buy or sell goods in a signed writing which by its terms gives assurance that it will be held open is not revocable, for lack of consideration, during the time stated or if no time is stated for a reasonable time, but in no event may such period of irrevocability exceed three months; but any such term of assurance on a form supplied by the offeree must be separately signed by the offeror.
§28:2--206. Offer and acceptance in formation of contract
(1) Unless otherwise unambiguously indicated by the language or circumstances
(a) an offer to make a contract shall be construed as inviting acceptance in any manner and by any medium reasonable in the J circumstances;
(b) an order or other offer to buy goods for prompt or current shipment shall be construed as inviting acceptance either by a prompt promise to ship or by the prompt or current shipment of conformmg or non-conforming goods, but such a shipment of non-conforming goods does not constitute an acceptance if the seller seasonably notifies the buyer that the shipment is offered only as an accommodation to the buyer^
(2) Where the beginning of a requested performance is a reasonable mode of acceptance an offeror who is not notified of acceptance within a reasonable time may treat the offer as having lapsed before acceptance.
§ 28:2--^207. Additional terms in acceptance or confirmation
(1) A definite and seasonable expression of acceptance or a written confirmation which is sent within a reasonable time operates as an acceptance even though it states terms additional to or different from those offered or agreed upon, unless acceptance is expressly made conditional on assent to the additional or different terms.
(2) The additional terms are to be construed as proposals for addition to the contract. Between merchants such terms become part of the contract unless:
(a) the offer expressly limits acceptance to the terms of the offer;
^b) they materially alter it; or
(c) notification of objection to them has already been given or is given within a reasonable time after notice of them is received.
(3) Conduct by both parties which recognizes the existence of a contract is sufficient to establish a contract for sale although the writings of the parties do not otherwise establish a contract. I n such case the terms of the particular contract consist of those terms on which the writings of the parties agree, together with any supplementary tenns incorporated under any other provisions of this subtitle.

§28:2--^208. Course of performance or practical construction
(1) Where the contract for sale involves repeated occasions for performance by eitlier party Avith knowledge of the nature of the performance and opportunity for objection to it by the other, any course of performance accepted or acquiesced in without objection shall be relevant to determine the nieaninjr of the agreement.
(2) The express terms of the agreement and any such course of performance, as well as any course of dealing and usage of trade, shall be construed whenever reasonable as consistent Avith each other; but when such construction is unreasonable, express terms shall control course of performance and course of performance shall control both course of dealing and usage of trade (section 28 :1--205).
(3) Subject to the pi^visions of the next section on modification and waiver, such course of ])erformance shall be relevant to show a waiver or modification of any term inconsistent with such course of performance.
§28:2--^209. Modification, rescission and waiver
(1) An agreement modifying a contract within this ai'ticle needs no consideration to be binding.
(2) A signed agreement which excludes modification or rescission except by a signed writing cannot be otherwise modified or rescinded, but except as between merchants such a requirement on a form supplied by the merchant must be separately signed by the other party.
(3) The requirements of the statute of frauds section of this article (section 28:2--201) must be satisfied if the contract as modified is within its provisions.
(4) Although an attempt at modification or rescission does not satisfy the requirements of subsection (2) or (-5), it can operate as a waiver.
(5) A party wlio has made a waiver affecting an executory portion of the contract may retract the waiver by reasonable notification received by the other party that strict performance will be required by any term waived, unless the retraction would be unjust in view of a material change of position in reliance on the waiver.
§ 28:2--^210. Delegation of performance; assignment of rights
(1) A party may perfonn his duty through a delegate unless otherwise agreed or unless the other party has a substantial interest in having his original promisor perform or control the acts required by the contract. No delegation of performance relieves the party delegating of any duty to perfom or any liability for breach.
(2) Unless otherwise agreed all rights of eitlier seller or buyer can be assigned except where the assignment would materially change the duty of the other party, or increase materially the burden or risk imposed on him by his contract, or impair materially his chance of obtaining return performance. A right to damages for breach of the whole contract or a right arising out of the assignor's due performance of his entire obligation can be assigned despite agreement otherwise.
(3) Unless the circumstances indicate the contrary a prohibition of assignment of ''the contract"' is to be construed as barring only the delegation to the assignee of the assignor's performance.
(4) An assignment of "the contract'' or of "all my rights under the contract'' or an jussignment in similar general teniis is an assignment of rights and unless the language or the circumstances (as in an assignment for security) indicate the contrary, it is a delegation of performance of the duties of the assignor and its acceptance by the assignee constitutes a promise by him to perform those duties. Tliis

promise is enforceable by either tlie assignor or the other party to tlie original contraxit.
(5) The other party may treat any assignment which delegates performance as creating reasonable grounds for insecurity and may without prejudice to his rights against the assignor demand assurances from the assignee (section 28:2--609).

PART 3--GENERAL OBLIGATION AND CONSTRUCTION OF
CONTRACT
§ 28:2--301. General obligations of parties
The obligation of the seller is to transfer and deliver and that of the buyer is to accept and pay in accordance with the contract.
§ 28:2--302. Unconscionable contract or clause
(1) If the court as a matter of law finds the contract or any clause of the contract to have been unconscionable at the time it was made the court may refuse to enforce the contract, or it may enforce the remainder of the contrjict without the unconscionable clause, or it may so limit the application of any unconscionable clause as to avoid any unconscionable result.
(2) When it is claimed or appears to the court that the contract or any clause thereof may be unconscionable the parties shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present evidence as to its commercial setting, purpose and effect to aid the court in making the determination.
§ 28:2--303. Allocation or division of risks
Where this article allocates a risk or a burden as between the parties "unless otherwise agreed", the agreement may not only shift the allocation but may also divide the risk or burden.
§ 28:2--304. Price payable in money, goods, realty, or otherwise
(1) The price can be made payable in money or otherwise. If it is payable in whole or in part in goods each party is a seller of the goods which he is to transfer.
(2) Even though all or part of the price is payable in an interest in realty the transfer of the goods and the seller's obligations with reference to them are subject to this article, but not the transfer of the interest in realty or the transferor's obligations in connection therewith.
§28:2--305. Open price term
(1) The parties if they so intend can conclude a contract for sale even though the price is not settled. In such a case the price is a reasonable price at the time for delivery if
(a) nothing is said as to price; or (b) the price is left to be agreed by the parties and they fail to agree; or (c) the price is to be fixed.in terms of some agreed market or other standard as set or recorded by a third person or agency and it is not so set or recorded. (2) A price to be fixed by the seller or by the buyer means a price for him to fix in good faith. (3) When a price left to be fixed otherwise than by agreement of the parties fails to l)e fixed through fault of one party the other may at his option treat the contract as cancelled or himself fix a reasonable price. (4) Where, however, the parties intend not to be bound unless the price be fixed or agreed and it is not fixed or agreed there is no contract. In such a case the buyer must return any goods already received or if miable so to do must pay their reasonable value at the time of

646

PUBLIC LAW 88-243-DEC. 30, 1963

[77 STAT.

delivery and the seller must return any portion of the price paid on account.
§ 28:2--306. Output, requirements and exclusive dealings
(1) A term which measures the quantity by the output of the seller or the re(}uirements of the buyer means such actual output or requirements as may occur in good faith, except that no quantity unreasonably dispro})ortionate to any stated estimate or in the absence of a stated estimate to any normal or otherwise comparable prior output or requirements may be tendered or demanded.
(2) A lawful agreement by either the seller or the buyer for exclusive dealing in the kind of goods concerned imposes unless otherwise agreed an obligation by the seller to use best efforts to supply the goods and by the buyer to use best efforts to promote their sale.
§ 28:2--307. Delivery in single lot or several lots
Unless otherwise agreed all goods called for by a contract for sale must be tendered in a single delivery and payment is due only on such tender but where the circumstances give either party the right to make or demand delivery in lots the price if it can be apportioned may be demanded for each lot.
§ 28:2--308. Absence of specified place for delivery
L'nless otherwise agreed (a) the place tor delivery of goods is the seller's place of busi-
ness or if he has none his residence; but (b) in a contract for sale of identified goods which to the
knowledge of the parties at the time of contracting are in some other place, that place is the place for their delivery; and
(c) documents of title may be delivered through customary banking channels.
§ 28:2--309. Absence of specific time provisions; notice of termination
(1) The time for shipment or delivery or any other action under a contract if not provided in this article or agreed upon shall be a reasonable time.
(2) Where the contract provides for successive performances but is indefinite in duration it is valid for a reasonable time but unless otherwise agreed may be terminated at any time by either party.
(3) Termination of a contract by one party except on the happening of an agreed event requires that reasonable notification be received by the other party and an agreement dispensing with notification is invalid if its operation would be unconscionable.
§ 28:2--310. Open time for payment or running of credit; authority to ship under reservation
Unless otherwise agreed (a) payment is due at the time and place at which the buyer is
to receive the goods even though the place of shipment is the place of delivery; and
(b) if the seller is authorized to send the goods he may ship them under reservation, and may tender the doctmients of title, but the buyer may inspect the goods after their arrival before payment is due unless such inspection is inconsistent with the terms of the contract (section 28:2--513) ; and
(c) if delivery is authorized and made by way of documents of title otherwise than by subsection (b) then payment is due at the time and place at which the buyer is to receive the documents regardless of where the goods are t,o be received; and

77 STAT. ]

PUBLIC LAW 88-243-DEC. 30, 1963

647

(d) where the seller is required or authorized to ship the goods on credit the credit period runs from the time of shipment but post-dating the invoice or delaying its dispatch will correspondingly delay the starting of the credit period.
§ 28:2--311. Options and cooperation respecting performance
(1) An agreement for sale which is otherwise sufficiently definite (subsection (3) of section 28:2--204) to be a contract is not made invalid by the fact that it leaves particulars of performance to be specified by one of the parties. Any such specification must be made in good faith and within limits set by commercial reasonableness.
(2) Unless otherwise agreed specifications relating to assortment of the goods are at the buyer's option and except as otherwise provided in subsections (1) (c) and (3) of section 28:2--319 specifications or arrangements relating to shipment are at the seller's option.
(3) "Where such specification would materially affect the other party's performance but is not seasonably made or where one party's cooperation is necessary to the agreed performance of the other but is not seasonably forthcoming, the other party in addition to all other remedies
(a) is excused for any resulting delay in his own performance; and
(b) may also either proceed to perform in any reasonable manner or after the time for a material part of his own performance treat the failure to specify or to cooperate as a breach by failure to deliver or accept the goods.
§ 28:2--312. Warranty of title and against infringement; buyer's obligation against infringement
(1) Subject to subsection (2) there is in a contract for sale a warranty by the seller that
(a) the title conveyed shall be good, and its transfer rightful; and
(b) the goods shall be delivei-ed free from any security interest or other lien or encumbrance of which the buyer at the time of contracting has no knowledge. (2) A warranty under subsection (1) will be excluded or modified only by specific language or by circumstances which give the buyer reason to know that the person selling does not claim title in himself or that he is purporting to sell only such right or title as he or a third person may have. (3) Unless otherwise agreed a seller who is a merchant regularly dealing in goods of the kind warrants that the goods shall be delivered free of the rightful claim of any third person by way of infringement or the like but a buyer who furnishes specifications to the seller must hold the seller harmless against any such claim which arises out of compliance with the specifications.
§ 28:2--313. Express warranties by affirmation, promise, description, sample
(1) Express warranties by the seller are created as follows: (a) Any affirmation of fact or promise made by the seller to the
buyer which relates to the goods and becomes part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the goods shall conform to the affirmation or promise.
(b) Any description of the goods which is made part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the goods shall conform to the description.
(c) Any sample or model which is made part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the whole of the goods shall conform to the sample or model.

648

PUBLIC LAW 88-243-DEC. 30, 1963

[77 STAT.

(2) I t is not necessary to the creation of an express warranty that the seller use formal words such as "warrant" or "guarantee" or that he have a specific intention to make a warranty, but an affinnation merely of the value of the goods or a statement purporting to be merely the seller's opinion or commendation of the goods does not create a warranty.
§ 28:2--314. Implied warranty: merchantability; usage of trade
(1) Unless excluded or modified (section 28:2--316), a warranty that the goods shall be mei-chantable is implied in a contract for tlieir sale if the seller is a merchant with respect to goods of that kind. Under this section the serving for value of food or drink to be consumed either on the premises or elsewhere is a sale.
(2) Goods to be merchantable must be at least such as (a) pass without objection in the trade under the contract
description; and (b) in the case of fungible goods, are of fair average quality
within the description; and (c) are fit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are
used; and (d) run, within the variations permitted by the agreement, of
even kind, quality and quantity within each unit and among all units involved; ajid
(e) are adequately contained, packaged, and labeled as the agreement may require; and
(f) conform to the promises or affirmations of fact made on the container or label if any. (3) Unless excluded or modified (section 28:2--316), other implied warranties may arise from course of dealing or usage of trade.
§ 28:2--315. Implied warranty: fitness for particular purpose
Where the seller at the time of contracting lias reason to know any particular purpose for which the goods are required and that the buyer is relying on the seller's skill or judgment to select or furnish suitable goods, there is unless excluded or modified under the next section an implied warranty that the goods sliall be fit for such purpose.
§ 28:2--316. Exclusion or modification of warranties
(1) Words or conduct relevant to the creation of an express warranty and words or conduct tending to negate or limit warranty shall be construed wherever reasonable as consistent with each other; but subject to the provisions of this article on parol or extrinsic evidence (section 28:2--202) negation or limitation is inoperative to the extent that such construction is unreasonable.
(2) Subject to subsection (3), to exclude or modify the implied warranty of merchantability or any part of it the language must mention merchantability and in case of a writing must he conspicuous, and to exclude or modify any implied warranty of fitness the exclusion must be by a writing and conspicuous. Language to exclude all implied w^arranties of fitness is sufficient if it states, for example, that "There are no warranties which extend beyond the description on the face hereof."
(3) Notwithstanding subsection (2) (a) imless the circumstances indicate otherwise, all implied
warranties are excluded by expressions like "as is", "with all faults" or other language which in common understanding calls the buyer's attention to the exclusion of warranties and makes plain that there is no implied warranty; and

PUBLIC LAW 88-243-DEC. 30, 1963

649

(b) when tlie buyer before entering into the contract has examined the goods or the sample or model as fully as he desired or has refused to examine the goods there is no implied warranty with regard to defects which an examination ought in the circumstances to have revealed to him; and
(c) an implied warranty can also be excluded or modified by course of dealing or course of performance or usage of trade. (4) Remedies for breach of warranty can be limited in accordance with the provisions of this article on liquidation or limitation of damages and on contractual modification of remedy (sections 28:2-- 718 and 28:2--719).

§ 28:2--317. Cumulation and conflict of warranties express or implied
Warranties whether express or implied shall be construed as consistent with each other and as cumulative, but if such construction is unreasonable the intention of the parties shall determine which warranty is dominant. In ascertaining that intention the following rules

^vp^y-

.

., . .

. .

(a) Exact or technical specifications displace an niconsistent

sample or model or general language of description.

(b) A sample from an existing bulk displaces inconsistent

general language of description.

(c) Express warranties displace inconsistent implied warran-

ties other than an implied warranty of fitness for a particular

purpose.

§28:2--318. Third party beneficiaries of warranties express or

implied

A seller's warranty whether express or implied extends to any natu-

ral person who is in the family or household of his buyer or who is a

guest in his home if it is reasonable to expect that such person may use,

consume or be affected by the goods and who is injured in person by

breach of the warranty. A seller may not exclude or limit the opera-

tion of this section.

§ 28:2--519. F.O.B. and F.A.S. terms
(1) Unless otherwise agreed the term F.O.B. (which means "free on board") at a named place, even though used only in connection with the stated price, is a delivery term under which
(a) when the term is F.O.B. the place of shipment, the seller must at that place ship the goods in the manner provided in this article (section 28:2--504) and bear the expense and risk of putting them into the possession of the carrier; or
(b) when the term is F.O.B. the place of destination, the seller must at his own expense and risk transport the goods to that place and there tender delivery of them in the manner provided m this article (section 28:2--503);
(c) when under either (a) or (b) the term is also F.O.B. vessel, car or other vehicle, the seller must in addition at his own expense and risk load the goods on board. If the term is F.O.B. vessel the buyer must name the vessel and in an appropriate case the seller must comply with the provisions of this article on the form of bill of lading (section 28:8--323).
(2) Unless otherwise agreed the term F.A.S. vessel (which means "free alongside") at a named port, even though used only in connection with the stated price, is a delivery term under which the seller must
(a) at his own expense and risk deliver the goods alongside the vessel in the manner usual in that port or on a dock designated and provided by the buyer; and

(3) Unless otherwise agreed in any case falling within sul>section (1) (a) or (c) or subsection (2) the buyer must seasonably give any needed instructions for making delivery, including when the term is F.A.S. or F.O.B. the loading berth of tlie vessel and in an appropriate case its name and sailing (late. The seller may treat the failure of needed instructioiis as a failure of cooperation under this article (section 28:2--811). He may also at his option move the goods in any reasonable manner preparatory to delivery or shi[)ment.
(4) Under the term F.O.B. vessel or F.A.S. unless otherwise agreed the buyer must make payment against tender of the required documents and the seller may not tender nor the buyer demand deVuery of the goods in substitution for the documents.
§28:2--320. C.I.F. and C. & F. terms

(b) load the goods and obtain a receipt from the carrier (which may be contained in the bill of lading) showing that the ireight lias been paid or provided for; and
(c) obtain a policy or certificate of insurance, including any war risk insurance, of a kind and on terms then current at the port of shipment in the usual amount, in the currency of the contract, shown to cover the same goods covered by the bill of lading and providing for payment of loss to the order of the buyer or for the account of whom it may concern; but the seller may add to the price the amount of the premium for any such war risk insurance; and
(d) prepare an invoice of the goods and procnire any other documents required to effect shipment or to comply with the contract; and
(e) forward and tender with commercial promptness all the documents in due foi-m and with any indorsement necessary to perfect the buyer's rights. (3) Unless otherwise agreed the term C & F. or its equivalent has the same effect and imposes upon the seller the same obligations and risks as a C.I.F. term except the obligation as to insurance. (4) Under the term C.I.F. or C. & F. unless otherwise agreed the buyer must make payment against tender of the required documents and the seller may not tender nor the buyer demand delivery of the goods in substitution for the documents.
§28:2--321. C.I.F. or C. & F.: "net landed weights"; "payment on on arrival"; warranty of condition on arrival
Under a contract containing a term C.I.F. or C. & F. (1) Where the price is based on or is to be adjusted according to "net landed weights", "delivered weights", "out turn" quantity or quality or the like, unless otherwise agreed the seller must reasonably estimate the price. The payment due on tender of the documents called for by the contract is the amount so estimated, but after final adjustment of the price a settlement must be made with commercial promptness.

(2) An agreement described in subsection (1) or any warranty of (luality or condition of the goods on arrival places upon the seller the risk of ordinary deterioration, shrinkage and the like in transportation but has no effect on the place or time of identification to the contract for sale or delivery or on the passing of the risk of loss.
(3) Unless otherwise agreed wliere the contract provides for payment on or after arrival of the goods the seller must before payment allow such preliminary inspection as is feasible; but if the goods are lost delivery of the documents and payment are due when the goods should have arrived.
§28:2--322. Delivery "ex-ship"
(1) Unless otherwise agreed a term for delivery of goods "ex-ship" (which means from the carrying vessel) or in equivalent language is not restricted to a particular ship and requires delivery from a ship which has reached a place at the named port of destination where goods of the kind are usually discharged.
(2) Under such a term unless otherwise agreed (a) the seller must discharge all liens arising out of the car-
riage and furnish the buyer with a direction which puts the carrier under a duty to deliver the goods; and
(b) the risk of loss does not pass to the buyer until the goods leave the ship's tackle or are otherwise properly unloaded.
§ 28:2--323. Form of bill of lading required in overseas shipment; "overseas'*
(1) Wliere the contract contemplates overseas shipment and contains a term C.I.F. or C. & F . or F.O.B. vessel, the seller unless otherwise agreed must obtain a negotiable bill of lading stating that the goods have been loaded on board or, in the case of a terrfi C.I.F. or C. & F., received for shipment.
(2) Where in a case within subsection (1) a bill of lading has been issued in a set of parts, unless otherwise agreed if the documents are not to be sent from abroad the buyer may demand tender of the full set; otherwise only one part of the bill of lading need be tendered. Even if the agreement expressly requires a full set
(a) due tender of a single part is acceptable within the provisions of this article on cure of improper delivery (subsection (1) of section 28:2--508); and
(b) even though the full set is demanded, if the documents are sent from abroad the person tendering an incomplete set may nevertheless require payment upon furnishing an indemnity which the buyer in good faith deems adequate. (3) A shipment by water or by air or a contract contemplating such shipment is "overseas" insofar as by usage of trade or agreement it is subject to the commercial, financing or shipping practices characteristic of international deep water commerce.
§ 28:2--324. "No arrival, no sale" term
Under a term "no arrival, no sale" or terms of like meaning, unless otherwise agreed,
(a) the seller must properly ship conforming goods and if they arrive by any means he must tender them on arrival but he assumes no obligation that the goods will arrive unless he has caused the non-arrival; and
(b) where without fault of the seller the goods are in part lost or have so deteriorated as no longer to conform to the contract or arrive after the contract time, the buyer may proceed as if there had been casualty to identified goods (section 28:2--613).

(1) Failure of the buyer seasonably to furnish an agreed letter of credit is a breacli of the contract for sale.
(2) The delivery to seller of a j)roper letter of credit suspends the buyer's obligation to pay. If the letter of credit is dishonored, the seller mav on seasonable notification to the buyer require payment directly irom him.
(3) Unless otherwise agreed the term "letter of credit" or "banker's credit"' in a contract for sale means an irrevocable credit issued by a financing agency of good repute and, where the shipment is overseas, of good international repute. The term "confirmed credit" means that the credit must also carry the direct obligation of such an agency which does business in the seller's financial market.
§28:2--326. Sale on approval and sale or return; consignment sales and rights of creditors
(1) Unless otherwise agreed, if delivered goods may be returned by the buyer even though they confoim to the contract, the transaction is
(a) a "sale on approval" if the goods are delivered primarily for use, and
(b) a "sale or return" if the goods are delivered primarily for resale. (2) Except as provided in subsection (3), goods held on approval are not subject to the claims of the buyer's creditors until acceptance; ' goods held on sale or return are subject to such claims while in the buyer's possession. (3) Where goods are delivered to a person for sale and such person maintains a place of business at which he deals in goods of the kind involved, under a name other than the name of the person making delivery, then with respect to claims of creditors of the person conducting the business the goods are deemed to be on sale or return. The provisions of this subsection are applicable even though an agreement purports to reserve title to the person making delivery until payment or resale or uses such words as "on consignment" or "on memorandum". However, this subsection is not applicable if the person making delivery
(a) complies wdth an applicable law providing for a consignor's interest or the like to be evidenced by a sign, or
(b) establishes that the person conductmg the business is generally known by his creditors to be substantially engaged in selling the goods of others, or
(c) complies with the filing provisions of the article on secured transactions (article 9). (4) Any "or return" term of a contract for sale is to be treated as a separate contract for sale within the statute of frauds section of this article (section 28:2--201) and as contradicting the sale aspect of the contract within the provisions of this article on parol or extrinsic evidence (section 28:2--202).
§28:2--327. Special incidents of sale on approval and sale or return
(1) Under a sale on approval imless otherwise agreed (a) although the goods are identified to the contract the risk
of loss and the title do not pass to the buyer until acceptance; and
(b) use of the goods consistent wdth the purpose of trial is not acceptance but failure seasonably to notify the seller of election to return the goods is acceptance, and if the goods conform to the contract acceptance of any part is acceptance of the whole; and

(c) after due notification of election to return, the return is at .the seller's risk and expense but a merchant buyer must follow any reasonable instructions. (2) Under a sale or return unless otherwise agreed
(a) the option to return extends to the whole or any commercial imit of the goods while in substantially their original condition, but must be exercised seasonably; and
(b) the return is at the buyer's risk and expense.
§28:2--328. Sale by auction
(1) In a sale by auction if goods are put up in lots each lot is the subject of a separate sale.
(2) A sale by auction is complete when the auctioneer so announces by the fall of the hammer or in other customary manner. Where a bid is made while the hammer is falling in accej)tance of a prior bid the auctioneer may in his discretion reopen the bidding or declare the goods sold under the bid on which the hammer was falling.
(3) Such a sale is with reserve unless the goods are in explicit terms put up without reserve. In an auction with reserve the auctioneer may withdraw the goods at any time until he announces completion of the sale. In an auction without reserve, after the auctioneer calls for bids on an article or lot, that article or lot cannot be withdrawn unless no bid is made within a reasonable time. In either case a bidder may retract his bid until the auctioneer's announcement of completion of the sale, but a bidder's retraction does not revive any previous bid.
(4) If the auctioneer knowingly receives a bid on the seller's behalf or the seller makes or procures such a bid, and notice has not been given that liberty for such bidding is reserved, the buyer may at his option avoid the sale or take the goods at the price of the last good faith bid prior to the completion of the sale. This subsection shall not apply to any bid at a forced sale.

PART 4--TITLE, CREDITORS AND GOOD FAITH
PURCHASERS
§ 28:2--401. Passing of title; reservation for security; limited application of this section
Each provision of this article with regard to the rights, obligations and remedies of the seller, the buyer, purchasers or other third parties applies irrespective of title to the goods except where the provision refers to such title. Insofar as situations are not covered by the other provisions of this article and matters concerning title become material the following rules apply:
(1) Title to ^oods cannot pass under a contract for sale prior to their identification to the contract (section 28:2--501), and unless otherwise explicitly agreed the buyer acquires by their identification a special property as limited by this subtitle. Any retention or reservation by the seller of the title (property) in goods shipped or delivered to the buyer is limited in effect to a reservation of a security interest. Subject to these provisions and to the provisions of the article on secured transactions (article 9), title to goods passes from the seller to the buyer in any manner and on any conditions explicitly agreed on by the parties.
(2) Unless otherwise explicitly agreed title passes to the buyer at the time and place at which the seller completes his performance with reference to the j)hysical delivery of the goods, despite any reservation of a security interest and even though a document of title is to be

654

PUBLIC LAW 88-243-DEC. 30, 1963

[77 STAT.

delivered at a dirt'erent time or place; and in pai'ticular and despite any reservation of a security interest by the bill of lading
g (a) if the contract requires or authorizes the seller to send the oods to the buyer but does not require him to deliver them at estination, title passes to the buyer at the time and place of shipment; but
(b) if the contract requires deliver}- at destination, title passes on tender there. (3) Unless otherwise explicitly agreed where delivery is to l3e made without moving the goods,
(a) if the seller is to deliver a document of title, title passes at the time when and the place where he delivers such documents;* or
(b) if the goods are at the time of contracting already identified and no documents are to he delivered, title passes at the time and place of contracting. (4) A rejection or other refusal by the buyer to receive or retain the goods, whether or not justified, or a justified revocation of acceptance revests title to the goods in the seller. Such revesting occurs by operation of law and is not a "sale".
§ 28:2--402. Rights of seller's creditors against sold goods
(1) Except as provided in subsections (2) and (3), rights of unsecured creditors of the seller with respect to goods which have been identified to a contract for sale are subject to the buyer's rights to recover the goods under this article (sections 28:2--502 and 28:2-- 716).
(2) A creditor of the seller nuiy treat a sale or an identification of goods to a contract for sale as void if as against him a retention of possession by the seller is fraudulent under any rule of law of the state where the goods are situated, except that retention of possession in good faith and current coui'se of trade by a merchant-seller for a commercially reasonable time after a sale or identification is not fraudulent.
(3) Nothing in this article shall be deemed to impair the rights of creditors of the seller
(a) under the provisions of the article on secured transactions (article 9); or
(b) where identification to the contract or delivery is made not in current course of trade but in satisfaction of or as security for a pre-existing claim for money, security or the like and is made under circumstances which under any rule of law of the state where the goods are situated would apart from this article constitute the transaction a fraudulent transfer or voidable preference.
§28:2--403. Power to transfer; good faith purchase of goods; "entrusting"
(1) A purchaser of goods acquires all title which his transferor had or had power to transfer except that a purchaser of a limited interest acquires rights only to the extent of the interest purchased. A person with voidable title has power to transfer a good title to a good faith purchaser for value. When goods have been delivered under a, transaction of purchase the purchaser has such power even though
(a) the transferor was deceived as to the identity of the purchaser, or
(b) the delivery was in exchange for a check which is later dishonored, or
(c) it was agreed that the transaction Avas to be a "cash sale", or (d) the delivery was procured through fraud punishable as larcenous under the criminal law.

77 STAT. ]

PUBLIC LAW 88-243-DEC. 30, 1963

6551

(2) Any entrustiiig of possession of goods to a niercliant who deals in goods of that kind gives him power to transfer all rights of the entruster to a buyer in ordinary course of business.
(3) "Entrusting" includes any delivery and any acquiescence in retention of possession regardless of any condition expressed between the parties to the delivery or acquiescence and regardless of whether the procurement of the entrusting or the possessor's disposition of the goods have been such as to be larcenous under the criminal law.
(4) The rights of other purchasers of goods and of lien creditors are governed by the articles on secured transactions (article 9), bulk transfers (article 6) and documents of title (article 7).
PART 5--PERFORMANCE
§ 28:2--501. Insurable interest in goods; manner of identification of goods
(1) The buyer obtains a special property and an insurable interest in goods by identification of existing goods as goods to which the contract refers even though the goods so identified are non-conforming and he has an option to return or reject them. Such identification can be made at any time and in any manner explicitly agreed to by the parties. In the absence of explicit agreement identification occurs
(a) when the contract is made if it is for the sale of goods already existing and identified;
(b) if the contract is for the sale of future goods other than those described in paragraph (c), when goods are shipped, marked or otherwise designated by the seller as goods to which the contract refers;
(c) when the crops are planted or otherwise become growing crops or the young are conceived if the contract is for the sale of unborn young to be born within twelve months after contracting or for the sale of crops to be harvested within twelve months or the next normal har\est season after contracting whichevei' is longer. (2) The seller retains an insurable interest in goods so long as title to or any security interest in the goods remains in him and where the identification is by the seller alone he may until default or insolvency or notification to the buyer that the identification is final substitute other goods for those identified. (3) Nothing in this section impairs any insurable interest recognized under any other statute or rule of law.
§ 28:2--502. Buyer's right to goods on seller's insolvency
(1) Subject to subsection (2) and even though the goods have not been shipped a buyer who has paid a part or all of the price of goods in which he has a special property under the provisions of the immediately preceding section may on making and keeping good a tender of any unpaid portion of their price recover them from the seller if the seller becomes insolvent within ten days after receipt of the first installment on their price.
(2) If the identification crejiting his special property has been made by the buyer he acquires the right to recover the goods only if they conform to the contract for sale.
§ 28:2--503. Manner of seller's tender of delivery
(1) Tender of delivery requires that the seller put and hold conforming goods at the buyer s disposition and give the buyer any notification reasonably necessary to enable him to take delivery. The manner, time and place for tender are determined by th^ agreement and this article, and in particular

656

PUBLIC LAW 88-243-DEC. 30, 1963

[77 STAT.

(a) tender nuist be at a reasonable hour, and if it is of jroods they must be kept available for the period reasonably necesstiry to enable the buyer to take possession; but
(b) unless otherwise agreed the buyer nnist furnish facilities reasonably suited to the receipt of the goods. (2) Where the case is within the next section respecting shipment tender requires that the seller comply with its provisions. (3) Where the seller is required to deliver at a particular destination tender requires that he comply with subsection (1) and also in any appropriate case tender dcx'uments as described in subsections (4) and (5) of this section. (4) Where goods are in the possession of a bailee and are to be delivered without being moved
(a) tender requires that the seller either tender a negotiable document of title covering such goods or procure acknowledgement by the bailee of the buyer's right to possession of the goods; but
(b) tender to the buyer of a non-negotiable document of title or of a written direction to the bailee to deliver is sufficient tender unless the buyer seasonably objects, and receipt by the bailee of notification of the buyers rights fixes those rights as against the bailee and all third persons; but risk of loss of the goods and of any failure by the bailee to honor the non-negotiable document of title or to obey the direction remains on the seller until the buyer has had a reasonable time to present the document or direction, and a refusal by the bailee to honor the document or to obey the direction defeats the tender.
(5) Where the contract requires the seller to deliver documents (a) he must tender all such documents in coiTect form except
as provided in this article with respect to bills of lading in a set (subsection (2) of section 28: 2--323); and
(b) tender through customary banking channels is sufficient and dishonor of a draft accompanying the documents constitutes non-acceptance or rejection.
§28:2--504. Shipment by seller
Where the seller is required or authorized to send the goods to the buyer and the contract does not require him to deliver them at a particular destination, then unless otherwise agreed he must
(a) put the goods in the possession of such a carrier and make such a contract for their transportation as may be reasonable having regard to the nature of the goods and other circumstances of the case; and
(b) obtain and promptly deliver or tender in due form any document necessary to enable the buyer to obtain possession of the goods or otherwise required by the agreement or by usage of trade; and
(c) promptly notify the buyer of the shipment.
Failure to notify the buyer under paragraph (c) or to make a proper contract under paragraph (a) is a ground for rejection only if material delay or loss ensues.
§ 28:2--505. Seller's shipment under reservation
(1) Where the seller has identified goods to the contract by or before shipment:
(a) his procurement of a negotiable bill of lading to his own order or otherwise reserves in him a security interest m the goods. His procurement of the bill to the order of a financing agency or of the buyer indicates in addition only the seller's expectation of transferring that interest to the person named.

77 STAT. ]

PUBLIC LAW 88-243~DEC. 30, 1963

657

(b) a non-negotiable bill of lading to himself or his nominee reserves possession of the goods as security but except in a case of conditional delivery (subsection (2) of section 28:2--507) a nonnegotiable bill of ladmg naming the buyer as consignee reserves no security interest even though the seller retains possession of the bill of lading. (2) When shipment bv the seller with reservation of a security interest is in violation of the contract for sale it constitutes an improper contract for transportation within the preceding section but impairs neither the rights given to the buyer by shipment and identification of the goods to the contract nor the seller's powers as a liolder of a negotiable document.
§ 28:2--506. Rights of financing agency
(1) A financing agency by paying or purchasing for value a draft which relates to a shipment of ^oods acquires to the extent of the payment or purchase and in addition to its own rights under the draft and any document of title securing it any rights of tlie shipper in the goods including the right to stop delivery and the shipper's right to have the draft honored by the buyer.
(2) The right to reimbursement of a financing agency which has in good faith honored or purchased the draft under commitment to or authority from the Iniyer is not impaired by subsequent discovery of defects with reference to any relevant document which was apparently regular on its face.
§ 28:2--507. Effect of seller's tender; delivery on condition
(1) Tender of delivery is a condition to the buyer's duty to accept the goods and, unless otherwise agreed, to his duty to pay for them. Tender entitles the seller to acceptance of the goods and to payment according to the contract.
(2) Where payment is due and demanded on the delivery to the buyer of goods or documents of title, his right as against the seller to retain or dispose of tliem is conditional upon his making the payment due.
§28:2--508. Cure by seller of improper tender or delivery; replacement
(1) Where any tender or delivery by tlie seller is rejected because non-conforming and the time for i)erformance has not yet expired, the seller may seasonably notify the buyer of his intention to cure and may then within the contract time make a conforming delivery.
(2) Where the buyer rejects a non-conforming tender which the seller had reasonable grounds to l)elieve would be acceptable with or without money allowance the seller may if he seasonably notifies the buyer have a further reasonable time to substitute a conforming tender.
§ 28:2--509« Risk of loss in the absence of breach
· (1) Where the contract recpiires or authorizes the seller to ship the goods by carrier
(a) if it does not require him to deliver them at a particular destination, the risk of loss passes to the buyer when the goods are duly delivered to the carrier even though the shipment is under reservation (section 28:2--505); but
(b) if it does require him to deliver them at a i)articular destination and the goods are there duly tendered while in the possession of ih^. carrier, the risk of loss passes to the buyer when the goods are there duly so tendered as to enable the buyer to take delivery.

[77 STAT.

(2) Where the goods are held by a bailee to l)e delivered without being moA'ed, the risk of loss passes to the buyer
(a) on his receipt of a negotiable document of title coA'ering the goods; or
(b) on acknowledgment by the bailee of the buyer's right to possession of the goods; or
(c) after his receipt of a non-negotiable document of title or other written direction to deliver, as provided in subsection (4) (b) of section 28:2--503. (3) In any case not within subsection (1) or (2), the risk of loss passes to the buyer on his receipt of the goods if the seller is a merchant; otherwise the risk passes to the buyer on tender of delivery. (4) The provisions of this section are subject to contrary agreement of the parties and to the provisions of this article on sale on approval (section 28:2--327) and on effect of breach on risk of loss (section 28:2--510).
§28:2--510. Effect of breach on risk of loss
(1) Where a tender or deliverjof goods so fails to conform to the contract as to give a right of rejection tlie risk of their loss remains on the seller until cure or acceptance.
(2) Where the buyer riglitfidly i-evokes acceptance he may to the extent of any deficiency in his effective insurance coverage treat the risk of loss as having rested on the seller from the l)eginning.
(3) Where the buyer as to conforming goods already identified to the contract for sale repudiates or is otherwise in breach l)efore risk of their loss has passed to him, the seller may to the extent of any deficiency in his effective insurance coverage treat the risk of loss as resting on the buyer for a commercially reasonable time.
§ 28:2--511. Tender of payment by buyer; payment by check
(1) Unless otherwise agreed tender of payment is a condition to the seller's duty to tender and complete any delivery.
(2) Tender of payment is sufficient Avhen made by any means or in any manner current in the ordinary course of business unless the seller demands payment in legal tender and gives any extension of time reasonably necessary to procure it.
(3) Subject to the provisions of this subtitle on the effect of an instrument on an obligation (section 28:3--802), ])ayment by check is conditional and is defeated as l)etween the parties by dishonor of tlie check on due ]>resentment.
§ 28:2--512. Payment by buyer before inspection
(1) Where the contract requires payment before inspection nonconformity of the goods does not excuse tlie buyer from so making payment unless
(a) the non-conformity appears without inspection; or (b) despite tender or the required doctiunents the circumstances would justify injunction against honor under the provisions of this subtitle (section 28:5--114). (2) Payment pursuant to subsection (1) does not constitute an acceptance of goods or impair the buyer's right to inspect or any of his remedies.
§ 28:2--513. Buyer's right to inspection of goods
(1) Unless otherwise agreed and subject to subsection (3), where goods are tendered or delivered or identified to the contract for sale, the buyer has a right before payment or acceptance to inspect them at any reasonable place and time and in any reasonable manner. When the seller is required or authorized to send the goods to the buyer, the inspection may be after their arrival.

PUBLIC LAW 88-243-DEC. 30, 1963

659

(2) Expenses of inspection must be borne by tlie buyer but may be recovered from tlie seller if the goods do not conform and are rejected.
(3) Unless otherwise agreed and subject to the provisions of this article on C.I.F. contracts (subsection (3) of section 28:2--321), the buyer is not entitled to inspect the goods before payment of the price when the contract provides
(a) for delivery ''C.O.D." or on other like terms; or (b) for payment against documents of title, except where such payment is due only after the goods are to become available for inspection. (-1) A place or method of inspection fixed by the parties is presumed to be exclusive but unless otherwiseexpressl}- agreed it does not postpone identification or shift the place for delivery or for passing the risk of loss. If compliance becomes impossible, inspection shall be as provided in this section unless the place or method fixed was clearly intended as an indispensable condition failure of which avoids the contract.
§28:2--514. When documents deliverable on acceptance; when on payment

the purpose of ascertaining the facts and preserving evidence has the right to inspect, test and sample the goods including such of them as may be in the possession or control of the other; and
(b) the parties may agree to a third pai-ty inspection or survey to determine the conformity or condition of the goods and may agree that the findings shall be binding upon them in any subsequent litigation or adjustment.
PART 6--BREACH, REPUDIATION AND EXCUSE
§ 28: 2--601. Buyer's rights on improper delivery
Subject to the provisions of this article on breach in installment contracts (section 28:2--(>12) and unless otherwise agreed under the sex^tions on contractual limitations of remedy (sections 28:2--718 and 28:2--719), if the goods or the tender of delivery fail in any respect to confonn to the contract, the buyer may

(2) Subject to the provisions of the two following sections on rejected goods (sections 28 :2--603 and 28:2--604),
(a) after rejection any exercise of ownership by the buyer with respect to any commercial unit is wrongful as against the seller; and
(b) if the buyer has before rejection taken physical possession of goods in which he does not have a security interest under the provisions of this article (subsection (3) of section 28:2--711), he

660

PUBLIC LAW 88-243-DEC. 30, 1963

[77 STAT.

is under a duty after rejection to hold them with reasonable care at the seller's disposition for a time sufficient to permit the seller to remove them; but
(c) the buyer has no further obligations with repn-d to goods rightfully rejected. (3) The seller's rights with respect to goods wrongfully rejected are governed by the provisions of this article on Seller's remedies in general (section 28:2--703).
§ 28: 2--603. Merchant buyer's duties as to rightfully rejected goods
(1) Subject to any security interest in the buyer (sul>secti()n (3) of section 28:2--711), when the seller has no agent or ])]ace of business at the market of rejection a merchant buyer is under a duty after rejection of goods in his possession or control to follow any reasonable instructions received from the seller with respect to the gcwxls and in the absence of such instructions to make reasonable efforts to sell them for the seller's account if they are perishable or threaten to decline in value speedily. Instructions are not reasonable if on demand indemnity for expenses is not forthcoming.
(2) When the buyer sells goods under subsection (1), he is entitled to reimbursement from the seller or out of the proceeds for reasonable expenses of caring for and selling them, and if the expenses include no selling connnission then to such commission as is usual in the trade or if there is none to a reasonable sum not exceeding ten per cent on the gross proceeds.
(3) In complying with this section the buyer is held only to good faith and good faith conduct hereunder is neither acceptance nor conversion nor the basis of an action for damages.
§28:2--604. Buyer's options as to salvage of rightfully rejected goods
Subject to the provisions of the immediately preceding section on perishables if the seller gives no instructions within a reasonable time after notification of rejection the buyer may store the rejected goods for the seller's account or reship them to him or resell them for the seller's account with reimbursement as provided in the preceding section. Such action is not acceptance or conversion.
§ 28:2--605. Waiver of buyer's objections by failure to particularize
(1) The buyer's failure to state in connection with rejection a particular defect which is ascertainable by reasonable inspection precludes him from relying on the unstated defect to justify rejection or to establish breach
(a) where the seller could have cured it if stated seasonably; or
(b) between merchants when the seller has after rejection made a request in writing for a full and final written statement of all defects on which the buyer proposes to rely. (2) Payment against documents made without reservation of rights j>recludes recovery of the payment for defects apparent on the face of the documents.
§ 28:2--606. What constitutes acceptance of goods

77 STAT. ]

PUBLIC LAW 88-243-DEC. 30, 1963

661

(c) does any act inconsistent with the seller's ownership; but if such act is wrongful as against the seller it is an acceptance only if ratified by him. (2) Acceptance of a part of any commercial unit is acceptance of that entire unit.
§28:2--607. Effect of acceptance; notice of breach; burden of establishing breach after acceptance; notice of claim or litigation to person answerable over
(1) The buyer must pay at the contract rate for any goods accepted. (2) Acceptance of goods by the buyer precludes rejection of the jioods accepted and if made with knowledge of a non-conformity cannot be revoked because of it unless the acceptance was on the reasonable assumption that the non-conformity would be seasonably cured but acceptance does not of itself impair any other remedy provided by this article for non-conformity.
(3) Where a tender has been accepted (a) the buyer must within a reasonable time after he discovers
or should have discovered any breach notify the seller of breach or be barred from any remedy; and
(b) if the claim is one for infringement or the like (subsection (3) of section 28:2--312) and the buyer is sued as a result of such a breach he must so notify the seller within a reasonable time after he receives notice of the litigation or be barred from any remedy over for liability established by the litigation.
(4) The burden is on the buyer to establish any breach with respect i o the goods accepted. * (5) Where the buyer is sued for breach of a warranty or other obligation for which his seller is answerable over
(a) he may give his seller written notice of the litigation. If the notice states that the seller may come in and defend and that if the seller does not do so he will be bound in any action against him by his buyer by any determination of fact common to the two litigations, then unless the seller after seasonable receipt of the notice does come in and defend he is so bound.
(b) if the claim is one for infringement or the like (subsection (3) of section 28:2--312) the original seller may demand in writing that his buyer turn over to him control of the litigation including settlement or else be barred from any remedy over and if he also agrees to bear all expense and to satisfy any adverse judgment, then unless the buyer after seasonable receipt of the demand does turn over control the buyer is so barred.
(6) The provisions of subsections (3), (4) and (5) apply to any obligation of a buyer to hold the seller harmless against infringement or the like (subsection (3) of section 28:2--312).
§ 28:2--608. Revocation of acceptance in whole or in part
(1) The buyer may revoke his acceptance of a lot or commercial unit whose non-conformity substantially impairs its value to him if he has accepted it
(a) on the reasonable assumption that its non-conformity would be cured and it has not been seasonably cured; or
(b) without discovery of such non-conformity if his acceptance was reasonably induced either by the difficulty of discovery before acceptance or by the seller's assurances. (2) Revocation of acceptance must occur within a reasonable time after the buyer discovers or should have discovered the ground for it and before any substantial change in condition of the goods Avhich is not caused by their own defects. I t is not effective until the buyer notifies the seller of it. (3) A buyer who so revokes has the same rights and duties with regard to the goods involved as if he had rejectea them.

§ 28:2--609. Right to adequate assurance of performance
(1) A contract for sale imposes an obligation on each party that the other's expectation of receiving due performance will not be impaired. When reasonable grounds for insecurity arise with respect to the performance of either party the other may in writing demand adequate assurance of due performance and imtil he receives such assurance may if commercially reasonable suspend any performance for which he has not already received the agreed return.
(2) Between merchants the reasonableness of grounds for insecurity and the adequacy of any assurance offered shall be determined according to commercial standards.
(3) Acceptance of any improper delivery or payment does not prejudice the aggrieved party's right to demand adequate assurance of future performance.
(4) After receipt of a justified demand failure to provide within a reasonable time not exceeding thirty days such assurance of due performance as is adequate under the circumstances of the particular case is a repudiation of the contract.
§ 28:2--610. Anticipatory repudiation
When either party repudiates the contract with respect to a performance not yet due the loss of which will substantially impair the value of the contract to the other, the aggrieved party may
(a) for a commercially reasonable time await performance by the repudiating party; or
(b) resort to any remedy for breach (section 28:2--703 or section 28:2--711), even though he has notified the repudiating party that he would await the latter's performance and has urged retraction; and
(c) in either case suspend his own performance or proceed in accordance with the provisions of this article on the seller's right to identify goods to the contract notwithstanding breach or to salvage unfinished goods (section 28:2--704).
§ 28:2--611. Retraction of anticipatory repudiation
(1) Until the repudiating party's next performance is due he can retract his repudiation unless the aggrieved party has since the repudiation cancelled or materially changed his position or otherwise indicated that he considers the repudiation final.
(2) Retraction may be by any method which clearly indicates to the aggrieved party that the repudiating party intends to perform, but must include any assurance justifiably demanded under the provisions of this article (section 28:2--609).
(3) Retraction reinstates the repudiating party's rights under the contract with due excuse and allowance to the aggrieved party for any delay occasioned by the repudiation.
§28:2--612. ''Installment contract"; breach
(1) An "installment contract" is one which requires or authorizes the delivery of goods in separate lots to be separately accepted, even though the contract contains a clause "each delivery is a separate contract" or its equivalent.
(2) The buyer may reject any installment which is non-conforming if the non-conformity substantially impairs the value of that installment and cannot be cured or if the non-conformity is a defect in the required documents; but if the non-conformity does not fall within subsection (3) and the seller gives adequate assurance of its cure the buyer must accept that installment.
(3) AVhenever non-conformity or default with respect to one or more installments substantially impairs the value of the whole con-

tract there is a breach of the, whole. But the aggrieved partjr reinstates the contract if he accepts a non-con:tonning installment without seasonably notifying of cancellation or if he bring an action with respect only to past mstallments or demands performance as to future installments.
§28:2--613. Casualty to identified goods
Where the contract requires for its performance goods identified when the contract is made, and the goods suffer casualty without fault of either party before the risk of loss passes to the buyer, or in a proper case under a "no arrival, no sale" term (section 28:2--324) then
(a) if the loss is total the contract is avoided; and (b) if the loss is partial or the goods have so deteriorated as no longer to conform to the contract the buyer may nevertheless demand inspection and at his option either treat the contract as avoided or accept the goods with due allowance from the contract price for the deterioration or the deficiency in quantity but without further right against the seller.
§ 28:2--614. Substituted performance
(1) Where without fault of either party the agreed berthing, loading, or unloading facilities fail or an agreed type of carrier becomes unavailable or the agreed manner of delivery otherwise becomes commercially impracticable but a commercially reasonable substitute is available, such substitute performance must be tendered and accepted.
(2) If the agreed means or manner of payment fails because of domestic or foreign governmental regulation, the seller may withhold or stop delivery unless the buyer provides a means or manner of payment which is commercially a substantial equivalent. If delivery has already been taken, payment by the means or in the manner provided by the regulation discharges the buyer's obligation unless the regulation is discriminatory, oppressive or predatory.
§ 28:2--615. Excuse by failure of presupposed conditions
Except so far as a seller may have assumed a greater obligation and subject to the preceding section on substituted performance:
(a) Delay in delivery or non-delivery in whole or in part by a seller who complies with paragraphs (b) and (c) is not a breach of his duty under a contract for sale if performance as agreed has been made impracticable by the occurrence of a contingency the non-occurrence of which was a basic assumption on which the contract was made or by compliance in good faith with any applicable foreign or domestic governmental regulation or order whether or not it later proves to be invalid.
(b) Where the causes mentioned in paragraph (a) affect only a part of the seller's capacity to perform, he must allocate production and deliveries among his customers but may at his option include regular customers not then under contract as well as his own requirements for further manufacture. He may so allocate in any manner which is fair and reasonable.
(c) The seller must notify the buyer seasonably that there will be delay or non-delivery and, when allocation is required under paragraph ( b ) , of the estimated quota thus made available for the buyer.
§ 28:2--616. Procedure on notice claiming excuse
(1) Wliere the buyer receives notification of a material or indefinite delay or an allocation justified under the preceding section he may by written notification to the seller as to any delivery concerned, an^ where the prospective deficiency substantially impairs the value of the whole contract under the provisions of this article relating to

breacli of installment contracts (section 28:2--012), then also as to the whole,
(a) terminate and thereby discharge any unexecuted portion of the contract; or
(b) modify the contract by agreeing to take his available quota in substitution. (2) If after receipt of such notification from the seller the buyer fails so to modify the contract within a reasonable time not exceeding thirty days the contract lapses with respect to any deliveries affectet^L (3) The provisions of this section may not be negated by agreement except in so far as the seller has assumed a greater obligation under the preceding section.

(3) The seller's right to reclaim under subsection (2) is subject to the rights of a buyer in ordinary coui'se or other good faith purchaser or lien creditor under this article (section 28:2--403). Successful reclamation of goods excludes all other remedies with respect to them.
§ 28:2--703. Seller's remedies in general
Where the buyer wrongfully rejects or revokes acceptance of goods or fails to make a payment due on or before delivery or repudiates with respect to a part or the whole, then with respect to any goods directly affected and, if the breach is of tlie whole contract (section 28:2--612), then also with respect to the whole undelivered balance, the aggrieved seller may
(a) withhold delivery of such goods; (b) stop delivery by any bailee as hereafter provided (section 28:2--705); (c) proceed under the next section respecting goods still unidentified to the contract; (d) resell and recover danuiges as hereafter provided (section 28:2--706); (e) recover damages for non-acceptance (section 28:2--708) or in a proper case the price (section 28:2--709) ; (f) cancel.

§28:2--705. Seller's stoppage of delivery in transit or otherwise
(1) The seller may stop delivery of goods in the possession of a carrier or other bailee when he discovers the buyer to be insolvent (section 28:2--702) and may stop delivery of carload, truckload, planeload or larger shipments of express or freight when tlie buyer lepudiates or fails to make a ])ayment due before delivery or if for any other reason the seller has a right to withhold or reclaim the goods.

(2) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3) or unless otherwise agreed resale may be at public or private sale including sale by way of one or more contracts to sell or of identification to an existing contract of the seller. Sale may be as a unit or in parcels and at any time and place and on any terms but every aspect of the sale including the method, manner, time, place and terms must be commercially reasonable.

666

PUBLIC LAW 88-243-DEC. 30, 1%3

[77 STAT.

goods be in existence or that any or all of them have been identified to the contract before the breach.
(3) Where the resale is at private sale the seller must give the buyer reasonable notification of his intention to resell.
(4) Where the resale is at public sale (a) only identified goods can be sold except where there is a
recognized market for a public sale of futures in goods of the kind; and

§ 28:2--707. "Person in the position of a seller"
(1) A "person in the position of a seller" includes as against a principal an agent who has paid or become responsible for the price of goods on behalf of his principal or anyone who otherwise holds a security interest or other right in goods similar to that of a seller.

(2) If the measure of damages provided in subsection (1) is inadequate to put the seller in as good a position as performance would have done then the measure of damages is the profit (including reasonable overhead) which the seller would have made from full performance by the buyer, together with any incidental damages provided in this article (section 28:2--710), due allowance for costs reasonably incurred and due credit for payments or proceeds of resale.
§ 28:2--709. Action for the price

77 STAT. ]

PUBLIC LAW 88-243-DEC. 30, 1963

667

(b) of goods identified to the contract if the seller is unable after reasonable effort to resell them at a reasonable price or the circumstances reasonably indicate that such effort will be unavailing.
(2) Where the seller sues for the price he must hold for the buyer any goods which have been identified to the contract and are still in his control except that if resale becomes possible he may resell them at any time prior to the collection of the judgment. The net proceeds of any such resale must be credited to the buyer and payment of the judgment entitles him to any goods not resold.
(3) After the buyer has wrongfully rejected or revoked acceptance of the goods or has failed to make a payment due or has repudiated (section 28:2--610), a seller who is held not entitled to the price under this section shall nevertheless be awarded damages for non-acceptance under the preceding section.
§28:2--710. Seller's incidental damages

(a) if the goods have been identified recover them as provided in this article (section 28:2--502); or
(b) in a proper case obtain specific performance or replevy the goods as provided in this article (section 28:2--716). (3) On rightful rejection or justifiable revocation of acceptance a buyer has a security interest in goods in his possession or control for any payments made on their price and any expenses reasonably incurred in their inspection, receipt, transportation, care and custody and may hold such goods and resell them in like manner as an aggrieved seller (section 28:2--706).
§28:2--712. "Cover"; buyer's procurement of substitute goods

[77 STAT.

§ 28:2--713. Buyer's damages for non-delivery or repudiation
(1) Subject to the provisions of this article with respect to proof of market price (section 28:2--723), the measure of damages for non-delivery or repudiation by the seller is the difference between the market price at the time when the buyer learned of the breach and the contract price together with any incidental and consequential damages provided in this article (section 28:2--715), but less expenses saved in consequence of the seller's breach.
(2) Market price is to be determined as of the place for tender or, in cases of rejection after arrival or revocation of acceptance, as of the place of arrival.
§28:2--714. Buyer's damages for breach in regard to accepted goods
(1) Where the buyer has accepted goods and given notification (subsection (3) of section 28:2--607) he may recover as damages for any non-conformity of tender the lo'ss resulting in the ordinary coui"se of events from the seller's breach as determined in any manner which is reasonable.
(2) The measure of damages for breach of warranty is the difference at the time and place of acceptance between the value of the goods accepted and the value they would have had if they had been as warranted, unless special circumstances show proximate damages of a different amount.
(3) In a proper case any incidental and consequential damages under the next section may also be recovered.
§ 28:2--715. Buyer's incidental and consequential damages
(1) Incidental damages resulting from the seller's breach include expenses reasonably incurred in inspection, receipt, transportation and care and custody of goods rightfully rejected, any commerciallj' i-easonable charges, expenses or commissions m connection with effecting cover and any other reasonable expense incident to the delay or other breach.

(a) any loss resulting from general or particular requirements and needs of which the seller at the time of contracting had reason to know and which could not reasonably be prevented by cover or otherwise; and
(b) injury to person or property proximately resulting from any breach of warranty.
§ 28:2--716. Buyer's right to specific performance or replevin

(3) The buyer has a right of replevin for goods identified to the contract if after reasonable effort he is unable to effect cover for such goods or the circmnstances reasonably indicate that such effort will be unavailing or if the goods have been shipped under reservation and satisfaction of the security interest in them has been made or tendered.
§ 28:2--717. Deduction of damages from the price
The buyer on notifying the seller of his intention to do so may deduct all or any part of the damages resulting from any breach of the contract from any part of the price still due under the same contract.

§28:2--718. Liquidation or limitation of damages; deposits
(1) Damages for breach by either party may be liquidated in the agreement but only at an amount which is reasonable in the light of the anticipated or actual harm caused by the breach, the difficulties of proof of loss, and the inconvenience or non-feasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy. A term fixing unreasonably large liquidated damages is void as a penalty.
(2) Where the seller justifiably withholds delivery of goods because of the buyer's breach, the buyer is entitled to restitution of any amount by which the sum of his payments exceeds
(a) the amount to which the seller is entitled by virtue of terms liquidating the seller's damages in accordance with subsection (1), or
(b) in the absence of such terms, twenty per cent of the value of the total performance for which the buyer is obligated under the contract or $500, whichever is smaller. (3) The buyer's right to restitution under subsection (2) is subject to offset to the extent that the seller establishes
(a) a right to recover damages under the provisions of this article other than subsection (1), and
(b) the amount or value of any benefits received by the buyer directly or indirectly by reason of the contract. (4) Where a seller has received payment in goods their reasonable , value or the proceeds of their resale shall be treated as payments for the purposes of subsection (2) ; but if the seller has notice of the buyer's oreach before reselling goods received in part performance, his resale is subject to the conditions laid down in this article on resale by an aggrieved seller (section 28:2--706).
§ 28:2--719. Contractual modification or limitation of remedy
(1) Subject to the provisions of subsections (2) and (3) of this section and of the preceding section on liquidation and limitation of damages,
(a) the agreement may provide for remedies in addition to or in substitution for those provided in this article and may limit or alter the measure of damages recoverable under this article, as by limiting the buyer's remedies to return of the goods and repayment of the price or to repair and replacement ot nonconforming goods or parts; and
(b) resort to a remedy as provided is optional unless the remedy is expressly agreed to be exclusive, in which case it is the sole remedy. (2) Where circumstances cause an exclusive or limited remedy to fail of its essential purpose, remedy may be had as provided in this subtitle. (3) Consequential damages may be limited or excluded unless the limitation or exclusion is unconscionable. Limitation of consequential damages for injury to the person in the case of consumer goods is prima facie unconscionable but limitation of damages where the loss is commercial is not.
§ 28:2--720. Effect of "cancellation" or "rescission" on claims for antecedent breach
Unless the contrary intention clearly appears, expressions of "cancellation" or "rescission" of the contract or the like shall not be construed as a renunciation or discharge of any claim in damages for an antecedent breach.

670

PUBLIC LAW 88-243-DEC. 30, 1963

[77 STAT.

§ 28:2--721. Remedies for fraud
Remedies for material misrepresentation or fraud inchide all remedies available under this article for nonfraudulent breach. Neither rescission or a claim for rescission of the contract for sale nor reiection or return of the goods shall bar or be deemed inconsistent with a claim for damages or other remedy.
§ 28:2--722. Who can sue third parties for injury to goods
Where a third party so deals with goods which have been identified to a contract for sale as to cause actionable injury to a party to that contract
(a) a right of action against the third pjirty is in either party to the contract for sale who has title to or a security interest or a special property or an insurable interest in the goods; and if the goods have been destroyed or converted a right of action is also in the party who either bore the risk of loss under the contract for sale or has since the injury assumed that risk as against the other;
(b) if at the time of the injury the party plaintiff did not bear the risk of loss as against the other party to the contract for sale and there is no arrangement between them for disposition of the recovery, his suit or settlement is, subject to his own interest, as a fiduciary for the other party to the contract;
(c) either party may with the consent of the other sue for the benefit of whom it may concern.
§ 28:2--723. Proof of market price: time and place
(1) If an action based on anticipatory repudiation comes to trial before the time for performance with respect to some or all of the goods, any damages based on market price (section 28:2--708 or section 28:2--713) shall be determined according to the price of such goods prevailing at the time when the aggrieved party learned of the repudiation.
(2) If evidence of a price prevailing at the times or places described in this article is not readily available the price prevailing within any reasonable time before or after the time described or at any other place which in commercial judgment or under usage of trade would serve as a resonable substitute for the one described may be used, making any proper allowance for the cost of transporting the goods to or from such other place.
(3) Evidence of a relevant price prevailing at a time or place other than the one described in this article offered by one party is not admissible unless and until he has given the other party such notice as the court finds sufficient to prevent unfair surprise.
§28:2--(724. Admissibility of market quotations
WTienever the prevailing price or value of any goods regularly bought and sold in any established commodity market is in issue, reports in official publications or trade journals or in newspapers or periodicals of general circulation published as the reports of such market shall be admissible in evidence. The circumstances of the preparation of such a report may be shown to affect its weight but not its admissibility.
§ 28:2--725. Statute of limitations in contracts for sale
(1) An action for breach of any contract for sale must be commenced within four years after the cause of action has accrued. By the original agi-eement the parties may reduce the period of limitation to not less than one year but may not extend it.
(2) A cause of action accrues when the breach occurs, regardless of the aggrieved party's lack of knowledge of the breach. A breach

77 STAT. ]

of warranty occurs when tender of delivery is made, except that where a warranty explicitly extends to future perfomiance of the j^oods and discovery of the breach must await the time of such performance the cause of action accrues when the breach is or should have been discovered.
(3) Where an action commenced within the time limited by subsection (1) is so terminated as to leave available a remedy by another action for the same breach such other action may be commenced after the expiration of the time limited and within six months after the termination of the first action imless the termination resulted from voluntary discontinuance or from dismissal for failure or neglect to prosecute.
(4) This section does not alter the law on tolling of the statute of limitations nor does it apply to causes of action which have accrued before this subtitle becomes effective.

(f) a term in a draft providing that the payee by indorsing or cashing it acknowledges full satisfaction of an obligation of the drawer; or
(g) a statement in a draft draAvn in a set of parts (section. 28:3--801) to the effect that the order is effective only if no other part has been honored. (2) Nothing in this section shall validate any term M'hich is otherwise illegal.
§28:3--113. Seal
An instrument otherwise negotiable is within this article even though it is under a seal.
§28:3--114. Date, antedating, postdating
(1) The negotiability of an instrument is not affected by the fact that it is undated, antedated, or postdated.
(2) Where an instrument is antedated or postdated the time when it is payable is determined by" the stated date if the instrument is payable on demand or at a fixed period after date.

§ 28:3--116. Instruments payable to two or more persons
An instrument payable to the order of two or more persons (a) if in the alternative is payable to any one of them and may

payable to the payee and may be negotiated, discharged or enforced by him;
(c) in any other manner is payable to the payee miconditionally and the additional words are without effect on subsequent parties.
§ 28:3--118. Ambiguous terms and rules of construction
The following rules apply to every instrument: (a) Where there is doubt whether the instrument is a draft
or a note the holder may treat it as either. A draft drawn on the drawer is effective as a note.

(c) Words control figures except that if the words are ambiguous figures control.
(d) Unless otherwise specified a provision for interest means interest at the judgment rate at the place of payment from the date of the instrument, or if it is undated from the date of issue.

(f) Unless otherwise specified consent to extension authorizes a single extension for not longer than the original period.

§ 28:3--119. Other writings affecting instrument
(1) As between the obligor and his immediate obligee or any transferee the terms of an instrument may be modified or affected by any other written agreement executed as a part of the same transaction, except that a holder in due course is not affected by any limitation of his rights arising out of the separate written agreement if he had no notice of the limitation when he took the instrument.
(2) A separate agreement does not affect the negotiability of an instrument.
§ 28:3--120. Instruments "payable through" bank

§28:3--121. Instruments payable at bank
A note or acceptance which states that it is payable at a bank is the equivalent of a draft drawn on the bank payable when it falls due out of any funds of the maker or acceptor in current account or otherwise available for such payment.
§ 28:3--122. Accrual of cause of action
(1) A cause of action against a maker or an a,cceptor accrues (a) in the case of a time instrument on the day after maturity; (b) in the case of a demand instrument upon its date or, if no
date is stated, on the date of issue. (2) A cause of action against the obligor of a demand or time certificate of deposit accrues upon demand, but demand on a tim^ certificate may not be made until on or after the date of maturity.

678

PART 2--TRANSFER AND NEGOTIATION
§ 28:3--^201. Transfer: right to indorsement
(1) Transfer of an instrument vests in the transferee such rights as the transferor has therein, except that a transferee who has himself been a party to any fraud or illegality affecting the instrument or who as a prior holder had notice of a defense or claim against it cannot improve his position by taking from a later holder in due course.
(2) A transfer of a security interest in an instrument vests the foregoing rights in the transferee to the extent of the interest transferred.
(3) Unless otherwise agreed any transfer for value of an instrument not then payable to bearer gives the transferee the specifically enforceable right to have the unqualified indorsement of the transferor. Negotiation takes effect only when the indorsement is made and until that time there is no presumption that the transferee is the owner.
§28:3--202. Negotiation
(1) Negotiation is the transfer of an instrument in such form that the transferee becomes a holder. If the instrument is payable to order it is negotiated by delivery with any necessary indorsement; if payable to bearer it is negotiated by delivery.
(2) An indorsement must be written by or on behalf of the holder and on the instrument or on a paper so firmly affixed thereto as to become a part thereof.
(3) An indorsement is effective for negotiation only when it conveys the entire instrument or any unpaid residue. If it purports to be of less it operates only as a partial assignment.
(4) Words of assignment, condition, waiver, guaranty, limitation or disclaimer of liability and the like accompanying an indorsement do not affect its character as an indorsement.
§ 28:3--203. Wrong or misspelled name
Where an instrument is made payable to a person under a misspelled name or one other than his own he may indorse in that name or his own or both; but signature in both names may be required by a person paying or giving value for the instrument.
§ 28:3--^204. Special indorsement; blank indorsement
(1) A special indorsement specifies the person to whom or to whose order it makes the instrument payable. Any instrument specially indorsed becomes payable to the order of the special indorsee and may be further negotiated only by his indorsement.
(2) An indorsement in blank specifies no particular indorsee and may consist of a mere signature. An instrument payable to order and indorsed in blank becomes payable to bearer and may be negotiated by delivery alone until specially indorsed.
(3) The holder may convert a blank indorsement into a special indorsement by writing over the signature of the indorser in blank any contract consistent with the character of the indorsement.

§ 28:3--^205. Restrictive indorsements
An indorsement is restrictive which either (a) is conditional; or (b) purports to prohibit further transfer of the instrument; or (c) includes the words "for collection", "for deposit", "pay
any bank", or like terms signifying a purpose of deposit or collection; or
(d) otherwise states that it is for the benefit or use of the indorser or of another person.
§28:3--206. Effect of restrictive indorsement
(1) No restrictive indorsement prevents further transfer or negotiation of the instrument.
(2) An intermediary bank, or a payor bank which is not the depositary bank, is neither given notice nor otherwise affected by a restrictive indorsement of any person except the bank's immediate transferor or the person presenting for payment.
(3) Except for an intermediary bank, any transferee under an indorsement which is conditional or includes the words "for collection", "for deposit", "pay any bank", or like terms (subparagraphs (a) and (c) of section 28:3--205) must pay or apply any value given by him for or on the security of the instrument consistently witn the indorsement and to the extent that he does so he becomes a holder for value. I n addition such transferee is a holder in due course if he otherwise complies with the requirements of section 28:3--302 on what constitutes a holder in due course.
(4) The first taker under an indorsement for the benefit of the indorser or another person (subparagraph (d) of section 28:3--205) must pay or apply any value ^iven by him for or on the security of the instrument consistently with the indorsement and to the extent that he does so he becomes a holder for value. In addition such taker is a holder in due course if he otherwise complies with the requirements of section 28:3--302 on what constitutes a holder in due course. A later holder for value is neither given notice nor otherwise affected by such restrictive indorsement unless he has knowledge that a fiduciary or other person has negotiated the instrument in any transaction for his own benefit or otherwise in breach of duty (subsection (2) of section 28:3--304).
§ 28:3--^207. Negotiation effective although it may be rescinded
(1) Negotiation is effective to transfer the instrument although the negotiation is
(a) made by an infant, a corporation exceeding its powers, or any other person without capacity; or
(b) obtained by fraud, duress or mistake of any kind; or (c) part of an illegal transaction; or (d) made in breach of duty. (2) Except as against a subsequent holder in due course such negotiation is in an appropriate case subject to rescission^ the declaration of a constructive trust or any other remedy permitted by law.
§ 28:3--208. Reacquisition
Where an instrument is returned to or reacquired by a prior party he may cancel any indorsement which is not necessary to his title and reissue or further negotiate the instrument, but any intervening party is discharged as against the reacquiring party and subsequent holders not in due course and if his indorsement has been cancelled is discharged as against subsequent holders in due course as well.

(4) Knowledge of the following facts does not of itself give the purchaser notice of a defense or claim
(a) that the instrument is antedated or postdated; (b) that it was issued or negotiated in return for an executory promise or accompanied by a separate agreement, unless the purchaser has notice that a defense or claim has arisen from the terms thereof; (c) that any party has signed for accommodation; (d) that an incomplete instrument has been completed, unless the purchaser has notice of any improper completion; (e) that any person negotiating the instrument is or was a fiduciary; (f) that there has been default in payment of interest on the instrument or in payment of any other instrument, except one of the same series.

Any person who by his negligence substantially contributes to a material alteration of the instrument or to the making of an unauthorized signature is precluded from asserting the alteration or lack of authority against a holder in due course or against a drawee or other payor who pays the instrument in good faith and in accordance with the reasonable commercial standards of the drawee's or payor's business.
§28:3--407. Alteration
(1) Any alteration of an instrument is material which changes the contract of any pai-ty thereto in any respect, including any such change in
(a) the number or relations of the parties; or (b) an incomplete instrument, by completing it otherwise than as authorized; or (c) the writing as signed, by adding to it or by removing any p)aart of it. ([·'2' ) As against any person other than a subsequent holder in due course
(a) alteration by the holder which is both fraudulent and material discharges any party whose contract is thereby changed unless that party assents or is precluded from asserting the defence;
(b) no other alteration discharges any party and the instrument may be enforced according to its original tenor, or as to incomplete instruments according to the authority given. (3) A subsequent holder in due course may in all cases enforce the instrument according to its original tenor, and when an incomplete instrument has been completed, he may enforce it as completed.
§28:3--408. Consideration
Want or failure of consideration is a defense as against any person not having the rights of a holder in due course (section 28:3--305), except that no consideration is necessaiy for an instrument or obligation thereon given in payment of or as security for an antecedent obligation of any kind. Nothing in this section shall be taken to displace any statute outside this subtitle under which a promise is enforceable notwithstanding lack or failure of consideration. Partial failure of consideration is a defense pro tanto whether or not the failure is in an ascertained or liquidated amount.
§28:3--409. Draft not an assignment
(1) A check or other draft does not of itself operate as an assignment of any funds in the hands of the drawee available for its payment, and the drawee is not liable on the instrument until he accepts it.
(2) Nothing in this section shall affect any liability in contract, tort or otherwise arising from any letter of credit or other obligation or representation whicm is not an acceptance.

[77 STAT.

(b) where an instrument is payable after sight it must either

be presented for acceptance or negotiated within a reasonable

time after date or issue whichever is later;

(d) where an instrument is accelerated presentment for pay-

ment is due within a reasonable time after the acceleration;

(e) with respect to the liability of any secondary party pre-

sentment for acceptance or payment of any other instrument is

due within a reasonable time after such party becomes liable

thereon.

of the instrument, any usage of banking or trade and the facts of

the particular case. I n the case of an uncertified check which is drawn

and payable within the United States and which is not a draft drawn

by a bank the following are presumed to be reasonable periods within

which to present for payment or to initiate bank collection:

date or issue whichever is later; and

·

(b) with respect to the liability of an indorser, seven days after

his indorsement.

other payors; or (b) to any person who has authority to make or refuse the

§ 28:3--506. Time allowed for acceptance or payment
(1) Acceptance may be deferred without dishonor until the close of the next business day following presentment.

(2) Except as a longer time is allowed in the case of documentary drafts drawn under a letter of credit, and unless an earlier time is agreed to by the party to pay, payment of an instrument may be deferred without dishonor pending reasonable examination to determine whether it is properly payable, but payment must be made in any event before the close of business on the day of presentment.
§28:3--507. Dishonor; holder's right of recourse; term allowing re-presentment
(1) An instrument is dishonored when (a) a necessary or optional presentment is duly made and
due acceptance or payment is refused or cannot be obtained within the prescribed time or in case of bank collections the instrument is seasonably I'eturned by the midnight deadline (section 28:4--301); or
(b) presentment is excused and the instrument is not duly accepted or paid. (2) Subject to any necessary notice of dishonor and protest, the holder has upon dishonor an immediate right of recourse against the drawere and indorsers.

(4) A term in a draft or an indorsement thereof allowing a stated time for i-e-presentment in the event of any dishonor of the draft by iionacce]3tance if a time draft or by nonpayment if a sight draft gives the holder as against any secondary party bound by the terai an option to waive the dishonor without affecting the liability of the secondary pai"ty and he may present again up to the end of the stated time.
§28:3--508. Notice of dishonor
(1) Notice of dishonor may be given to any person who may be liable on the instrument by or on behalf of the holder or any party who has himself received notice, or any other party who can be compelled to pay the instrument.

(3) Notice may be given in any reasonable manner. It may be oral or written and in any terms which identify the instrument and state that it has been dishonored. A misdescription which does not mislead the party notified does not vitiate the notice. Sending the instrument bearing a stamp, ticket or writing stating that acceptance or payment has been refused or sending a notice of debit with respect to the instrument is sufficient.

(3) The liability of all parties is discharged when any party who has himself no right of action or recourse on the instrument (a) reaccfuires the instrument in his own right; or (b) is discharged under any provision of this article except as otherwise provided with respect to discharge for impairment of recourse or of collateral (section 28:3--606).

(1) An}^ party making tender of full payment to a holder when or after it is due is discharged to the extent of all subsequent liability for interest, costs, and attorney's fees.

§ 28:3--605. Cancellation and renunciation
(1) The holder of an instrument may even without consideration discharge any party
(a) in any manner apparent on the face of the instrument or the indorsement, as by intentionally cancelling the instrument or the party's signature by destruction or mutilation, or by striking out the party's signature; or

(a) without express reservation of rights releases or agrees not to sue any person against whom the party has to the knowledge of the holder a right of recourse or agrees to suspend the right to enforce against such person the instrument or collateral or otherwise discharges such person, except that failure or delay in effecting any required presentment, protest or notice of dishonor with respect to any such person does not discharge any party as to whom presentment, protest or notice of dishonor is effective or unnecessary; or
(b) unjustifiably impairs any collateral for the instrument given by or on behalf of the party or any person against w^hom he has a right of recourse. (2) By express reservation of rights against a party with a right of recourse the holder preserves
(a) all his rights against such party as of the time when the instrument was originally due; and

PART 7--ADVICE OF INTERNATIONAL SIGHT DRAFT
§ 28:3--701. Letter of advice of international sight draft
(1) A '"letter of advice" is a drawer's coniniiinifatioii to tlie drawee that a described draft has been drawn.
(2) Unless otherwise agreed when a bank recei\es from another bank a letter of advice of an international sight draft the drawee bank may immediately debit the drawer's account and stop the rmining of interest pro tanto. Such a debit and any resulting credit to any account covering outstanding drafts leaves in the drawer full power to stop payment or otherwise dispose of the amount and creates no trust or interest in favor of the holder.
(3) Unless otherwise agreed and except where a draft is drawn under a credit issued by the drawee, the drawee of an international s'ght draft owes the drawer no duty to pay an unadvised draft but if it does so and the draft is genuine, may appropriately debit the drawer's account.
PART 8--MISCELLANEOUS
§ 28:3--801. Drafts in a set
(1) Where a draft is drawn in a set of parts, each of which is numbered and expressed to be an order only if no other part has been honored, the whole of the parts constitutes one draft but a taker of any part may become a holder in due course of the draft.
(2) Any person who negotiates, indorses or accepts a single part of a draft drawn in a set thereby becomes liable to any holder in due course of that part as if it were the whole set, but as between different holders in due course to whom different parts have been negotiated the holder whose title first accrues has all rights to the draft and its proceeds.
(3) As against the drawee the first presented part of a draft drawn in a set is the part entitled to payment, or if a time draft to acceptance and payment. Acceptance of any subsequently presented part rendei*s the drawee liable thereon under subsection (2). With respect both to a holder and to the drawer payment of a subsequently presented part of a draft payable at sight has the same effect as payment of a check notwithstandmg an effective stop order (section 28:4--407).
(4) Except as otherwise provided in this section, where any part of a draft in a set is discharged by payment or otherwise the w^hole draft is discharged.
§28:3--802. Effect of instrument on obligation for which it is given
(1) Unless otherwise agreed where an instrument is taken for an underlying obligation
(a) the ooligation is pro tanto discharged if a bank is drawer, maker or acceptor of the instrument and there is no recourse on the instrument against the underlying obligor; and
(b) in any other case the obligation is suspended pro tanto until the instrument is due or if it is payable on demand until its presentment. If the instrument is dishonored action may be maintained on either the instrument or the obligation; discharge of the underlying obligor on the instrument also discharges him on the obligation. (2) The taking in good faith of a check which is not postdated does not of itself so extend the time on the original obligation as to discharge a surety.

This provision applies regardless of the form of indorsement or lack of indorsement and even though credit given for the item is subject to immediate withdrawal as of right or is in fact withdrawn; but the continuance of ownership of an item by its owner and any rights of the owner to proceeds of the item are subject to rights of a collecting bank such as those resulting from outstanding advances on the item and valid rights of setoff. "V\Tien an item is handled by banks for purposes of presentment, payment and collection, the relevant provisions of this article apply even though action of parties clearly establishes that a particular bank has purchased the item and is the owner of it.

(a) until the item has been returned to the customer initiating collection; or

(2) A collectiiig bank may send (a) any item direct to the payor bank; (b) any item to any non-bank payor if authorized by its trans-
feror; and (c) any item other than documentary drafts to any non-bank
payor, if authorized by Federal Reserve regulation or operating letter, clearing house rule or the like. (3) Presentment may be made by a presenting bank at a place where the payor bank has requested that presentment be nuide.
§ 28:4--^205. Supplying missing indorsement; no notice from prior indorsement
(1) A depositary bank which has taken an item for collection may supply any indorsement of the customer which is necessary to title unless the item contains the words "payee's indorsement required" or the like. In the absence of such a requirement a statement placed on the item by the depositaiy bank to the effect that the item was deposited by a customer or credited to his account is effective as the <'UStomer"s indorsement.
(2) An intermediary bank, or payor bank which is not a depositary bank, is neither given notice nor otherwise affected by a restrictive indorsement of any person except the bank's immediate transferor.
§28:4--206. Transfer between banks

700

PUBLIC LAW 88-243-DEC. 30, 1963

[77 STAT.

by any customer or collex'ting bank that is a holder in due course and acts in good faith
(i) to a maker with respect to the maker's own signature; or
(ii) to a drawer with respect to the drawer's own signature, whether or not the drawer is also the drawee; or
(iii) to an acceptor of an item if the holder in due course took the item after the acceptance or obtained the acceptance without knowledge that the drawer's signature was unauthorized; and (c) the item has not been materially altered, except that this warranty is not given by any customer or collecting bank that is a holder in due course and acts in good faith
(i) to the maker of a note; or (ii) to the drawer of a draft whether or not the drawer is also the drawee; or (iii) to the acceptor of an item with respect to an alteration made prior to the acceptance if the holder in due course took the item after the acceptance, even though the acceptance provided "payable as originally drawn" or equivalent terms; or (iv) to the acceptor of an item with respect to an alteration made after the acceptance. (2) Each customer and collecting bank who transfers an item and receives a settlement or other consideration for it warrants to his transferee and to any subsequent collecting bank wlio takes the item in good faith that (a) he has a good title to the item or is authorized to obtain payment or acceptance on behalf of one who lias a good title and the transfer is otherwise rightful; and (b) all signatures are genuine or authorized; and (c) the item has not been materially altered; and (d) no defense of any party is good against him; and (e) he has no knowledge of any insolvency proceeding instituted with respect to the maker or acceptor or the drawer of an unaccepted item. In addition each customer and collecting bank so transferring an item and receiving a settlement or other consideration engages that upon dishonor and any necessary notice of dishonor and protest he will take up the item. (3) The warranties and the engagement to honor set forth in the two preceding subsections arise notwithstanding the absence of indorsement of words of guaranty or warranty in the transfer or presentment and a collecting bank remains liable for their breach despite remittance to its transferor. Damages for breach of such warranties or engagement to. honor shall not exceed the consideration received by the customer or collecting bank responsible plus finance charges and expenses related to the item, if any. (4) Unless a claim for breach of warranty under this section is made within a reasonable time after the person claiming learns of the breach, the person liable is discharged to the extent of any loss caused by the delay in making claim.

(c) if it makes an advance on or against the item. (2) When credit which has been given for several items received, at one time or pursuant to a single agreement is withdrawn or applied in part the security interest remains upon all the items, any accompanying documents or the proceeds of either. For the purpose of this section, credits first given are first withdrawn. (3) Receipt by a collecting bank of a final settlement for an item is a realization on its security interest in the item, accompanying documents and proceeds. To the extent and so long as the bank does not receive final settlement for the item or give up possession of the item or accompanying documents for purposes otlier than collection, tlie security interest continues and is subject to the provisions of article 9 except that
(a) no security agreement is necessary to make the security interest enforceable (subsection (1) (b) of section 28:9--203); and

(2) Where presentment is made by notice and neither honor nor request for compliance with a requirement under section 28:3--505 is received by the close of business on the day after maturity or in the case of demand items by the close of business on the third banking day after notice was sent, the presenting bank may treat the item as dishonored and charge any secondary party by sending him notice of the facts.
§ 28:4--211. Media of remittance; provisional and final settlement in remittance cases
(1) A collecting bank may take in settlement of an item (a) a check of the remitting bank or of another bank on any
bank except the remitting bank; or (b) a cashier's check or similar primary obligation of a remit-
ting bank which is a member of or clears through a member of the same clearing house or group as the collecting bank; or

(b) if the person receiving the settlement has authorized remittance by a non-bank check or obligation or by a cashier's check or similar primary obligation of or a check upon the payor , or other remitting bank which is not of a kind approved by sub. section ( l ) ( b ) , -- a t the time of the receipt of such remittance check or obligation; or
(c) if in a case not covered by sub-paragraphs (a) or (b) the person receiving the settlement fails to seasonably present, forward for collection, pay or return a remittance instrument or authorization to it to charge before its midnight deadline,--at such midnight deadline.
§ 28:4--212. Right of charge-back or refund

^a) prior use of the credit given for the item; or (b) failure by any bank to exercise ordinary care with respect to the item but any bank so failing remains liable. (5) A failure to charge-back or claim refund does not affect other rights of the bank against the customer or any other party.

(a) the location and general description of the property to be transferred and the estimated total of the transferor's debts;
(b) the address where the schedule of property and list of creditors (section 28 :6--104) may be inspected;
(c) whether the transfer is to pay existing debts and if so the amount of such debts and to whom owing;

If the precise amount of such advances made or of such liabilities incurred is, at the time of the issue of the receipt, unknown to the warehouseman or to his agent who issues it, a statement of the fact that advances have been made or liabilities incurred and the purpose thereof is sufficient. (3) A warehouseman may insert in his receipt any other terms which are not contrary to the provisions of this subtitle and do not impair his obligation of delivery (section 28:7--±08) or his duty of care (section 28:7--204).

§28:7--^204. Duty of care; contractual limitation of warehouseman's liability
(1) A warehouseman is liable for damages for loss of or injury to the goods caused by his failure to exercise such care in regard to them as a reasonably careful man would exercise under like circumstances but unless otherwise agreed he is not liable for damages which could not have been avoided by the exercise of such care.
(2) Damages may be limited by a term in the warehouse receipt or storage agreement limiting the amount of liability in case of loss or damage, and setting forth a specific liability per article or item, or value per unit of weight, beyond which the warehouseman shall not be liable: Provided^ however^ That such liability may on written request of the bailor at the time of signing such storage agreement or within a reasonable time after receipt of the warehouse receipt be increased on part or all of the goods thereunder, in which event increased rates may be charged based on such increased valuation, but that no such increase shall be permitted contrary to a lawful limitation of liability contained in the warehouseman's tariff, if any.

§28:7--^205. Title under warehouse receipt defeated in certain cases
A buyer in the ordinary course of business of fungible goods sold and delivered by a warehouseman who is also in the business of buying and selling such goods takes free of any claim under a warehouse receipt even though it has been duly negotiated.
§ 28:7--206. Termination of storage at warehouseman's option
(1) A warehouseman may on notifying the person on whose account the goods are held and any other person known to claim an interest in the ,goods require payment of any charges and removal of the goods from the warehouse at the termination of the period of storage fixed by the document, or, if no period is fixed, within a stated period not less than thirty days after the notification. If the goods are not removed before the date specified in the notification, the warehouseman may sell them in accordance with the provisions of the section on enforcement of a warehouseman's lien (section 28:7--210).
(2) If a warehouseman in good faith believes that the goods are about to deteriorate or decline in value to less than the amount of his lien within the time prescribed in subsection (1) for notification, advertisement and sale, the warehouseman may specify in the notification any reasonable shorter time for removal of the goods and in case the goods are not removed, may sell them at public sale held not less than one week after a single advertisement or posting.
(3) If as a result of a quality or condition of the goods of which the warehouseman had no notice at the time of deposit the goods are a hazard to other property or to the warehouse or to persons, the warehouseman may sell the goods at public or private sale without advertisement on reasonable notification to all persons known to claim an interest in the goods. If the warehouseman after a reasonable effort is unable to sell the goods he may dispose of them in any lawful manner and shall incur no liability by reason of such disposition.
(4) The warehouseman must d.eliver the goods to any person entitled to them under this article upon due demand made at any time prior to sale or other disposition under this section.
(5) The warehouseman may satisfy his lien from the proceeds of any sale or disposition under this section but must hold the balance for delivery on the demand of any person to whom he would have been bound to deliver the goods.
§ 28:7--207. Goods must be kept separate; fungible goods
(1) Unless the warehouse receipt otherwise provides, a warehouseman must keep separate the ^oods covered by each receipt so as to permit at all times identification and delivery of those goods except that different lots of fungible goods may be conuningled.
(2) Fungible goods so commingled are owned in common by the persons entitled thereto and tKe warehouseman is severally liable to each owner for that owner's share. Where because of overissue a mass of fungible goods is insufficient to meet all the receipts which the warehouseman has issued against it, the persons entitled include all holders to whom overissued receipts have been duly negotiated.
§28:7--208. Altered warehouse receipts
Where a blank in a negotiable warehouse receipt has been filled in without authority, a purchaser for value and without notice of the want of authority, may treat the insertion as authorized. Any other unauthorized alteration leaves any receipt enforceable against the issuer according to its original tenor.

PUBLIC LAW 88-243-DEC. 30, 1963

[77 STAT.

§28:7--209. Lien of warehouseman
(1) A warelioiisemau has a lien against the bailor on the goods covered by a warehouse receipt or on the proceeds thereof in his possession for charges for storage or transportation (including demurrage and terminal charges), insurance, labor, or charges present or future ii'i relation to the goods, and for expenses necessary for preservation of the goods or reasonably incurred in their sale pursuant to law. If the person on whose account the goods are held is liable for like charges or expenses in relation to other goods whenever deposited and it is stated in the receipt that a lien is claimed for charges and expenses in relation to other goods, the warehouseman also has a lien against him for such charges and expenses whether or not the other goods have been delivered by the warehouseman. But against a person to whom a negotiable warehouse receipt is duly negotiated a wareliouseman's lien is limited to charges in an amount or at a rate specified on the receipt or if no charges are so specified then to a reasonable charge for storage of the goods covered by the receipt subsequent to the date of the receipt.
(2) The warehouseman may also reserve a security interest against the bailor for a maximum amount specified on the receipt for charges other than those specified in subsection (1), such as for money advanced and interest. Such a security interest is governed by the article on secured transactions (article 9).
(3) A warehouseman's lien for charges and expenses under subsection (1) or a security interest under subsection (2) is also effective against any person who so entrusted the bailor with possession of the goods that a pledge of them by him to a good faith purchaser for value would have been valid but is not effective against a person as to whom the document confers no right in the goods covered by it under section 28:7--503.
(4) A warehouseman loses his lien on any goods which he voluntai-ily delivers or which he unjustifiably refuses to deliver.
§28:7--210. Enforcement of warehouseman's lien
(1) Except as provided in subsection (2), a warehouseman's lien may be enforced by public or private sale of the goods in bloc or in parcels, at any time or place and on any terms which are commercially reasonable, after notifying all persons known to claim an interest in the goods. Such notification must include a statement of the amount due, the nature of the proposed sale and the time and place of any public sale. The fact that a better price could have been obtained by a sale at a different time or in a different method from that selected by the warehouseman is not of itself sufficient to establish that the sale was not made in a commercially reasonable manner. If the warehouseman either sells the goods in the usual manner in any recognized market therefor, or if he sells at the price current in such market at the time of his sale, or if he has otherwise sold in conformity with commercially reasonable practices among dealers in the type of goods sold, he has sold in a commercially reasonable manner. A sale of more goods than apparently necessary to be offered ^o insure satisfaction of the obligation is not commercially reasonable except in cases covered by the preceding sentence.
(2) A warehouseman's lien on goods other than goods stored by a merchant in the course of his business may be enforced only as follows:
(a) All persons known to claim an interest in the goods must be notified.
(b) The notification must be delivered in person or sent by registered or certified letter to the last known address of any person to be notified.

77 STAT. ]

PUBLIC LAW 88-243-DEC. 30, 1963

723

(c) The notification nuist include an itemized statement of the claim, a description of the ^oods subject to the lien, a demand for payment within a specified time not less than ten days after receipt of the notification, and a conspicuous statement that unless the claim is paid within that time the goods will be advertised for sale and sold by auction at a specified time and place.
(d) The sale must conform to the terms of the notification. (e) The sale must be held at the nearest suitable place to that where the goods are held or stored. (f) After the expiration of the time given in the notification, an advertisement of the sale must be published once a week for two weeks consecutively in a newspaper of general circulation where the sale is to be held. The advertisement must include a description of the goods, the name of the person on whose account they are being held, and the time and place of the sale. The sale must take place at least fifteen days after the first publication. If there is no newspaper of general circulation where the sale is to be held, the advertisement must be posted at least ten days before the sale in not less than six conspicuous places in the neighborhood of the proposed sale. (3) Before any sale pursuant to this section any person claiming a right in the goods may pay the amount necessary to satisfy the lien and the reasonable expenses incurred under this section. In that event the goods must not be sold, but must be retained by the w^arehouseman subject to the terms of the receipt and this article. (4) The warehouseman may buy at any public sale pursuant to this section. (5) A purchaser in good faith of goods sold to enforce a warehouseman s lien takes the goods free of any rights of persons against w^hom the lien was valid, despite noncompliance by the warehouseman w^ith the requirements of this section. (6) The warehouseman may satisfy his lien from the proceeds of any sale pursuant to this section but must hold the balance, if any, for delivery on demand to any person to whom he would have been bound to deliver the goods. (7) The rights provided by this section shall be in addition to all other rights allowed by law to a creditor against his debtor. (8) Where a lien is on goods stored by a merchant in the course of his business the lien may be enforced in accordance with either subsection (1) or (2). (9) The warehouseman is liable for damages caused by failure to comply with the requirements for sale under this section and in case of willful violation is liable for conversion.
PART 3--BILLS OF LADING: SPECIAL PROVISIONS
§28:7--301. Liability for non-receipt or misdescription; "said to contain"; "shipper's load and count"; improper handling
(1) A consignee of a non-negotiable bill who has given value in good faith or a holder to whom a negotiable bill has been duly negotiated relying in either case upon the description therein of the goods, or upon the date therein shown, may recover from the issuer damages caused by the misdating of the bill or the non-receipt or misdescription of the goods, except to the extent that the document indicates that the issuer does not know whether any part or all of the goods in fact were received or conform to the description, as where the description is in terms of marks or labels or kind, quantity, or condition or the receipt or description is qualified by "contents or con-

I n such cases "shipl)er"s weight, load and count"' or other words indicatuig that tlie description was made by the shipper are ineffective except as to freight concealed by packages.
(3) When bulk freight is loaded by a shipper who makes available to the issuer adequate facilities for Aveighing such freight, an issuer who is a common carrier must ascertain the kind and quantity within a reasonable time after receiving the written request of the shipper to do so. I n such cases "shipper's weight/' or other words of like pui"port are ineffective.
(4) The issuer may by inserting in the bill the words "shipper's weight, load and count'' or other words of like purport indicate that the goods were loaded by the shipper; and if such statement be true the issuer shall not be liable for damages caused by the improper loading. But their omission does not imply liability for such damages.
(5) The shipper shall be deemed to have guaranteed to the issuer the accuracy at the time of shipment of the description, marks, labels, number, kind, quantity, condition and weight, as furnished by him; and the shipper shall indemnify the issuer against damage caused by inaccuracies in such particulars. The right of the issuer to such indemnity shall in no way limit his responsibility and liability under the contract of carriage to any person other than the shipper.

(1) The issuer of a tlirough bill of lading or other document embodying an undertaking to be performed in part by persons acting as its agents or by connecting carriers is liable to anyone entitled to recover on the document for any breach by such other persons or by a connecting carrier of its obligation under the document but to the extent that the bill covers an undertaking to be performed overseas or in territory not contiguous to tlie continental United States or an undertakin|r including matters other than transportation this liability may be varied by agreement of the parties.
(2) Where goods covered by a through bill of lading oi- other document embodying an undertaking to be performed in part by persons other than the issuer are received by any such person, he is subject with respect to his own performance while the goods are in his possession to the obligation of the issuer. His obligation is discharged by delivery of the goods to another such person pursuant to the document, and does not include liability for breach by any other such persons or by the issuer.
(3) The issuer of such through bill of lading or other document shall be entitled to recover from the connecting carrier or such other person in possession of the goods when the breach of the obligation under the dociiment occurred, the amount it may be required to pay to anyone entitled to recover on the document therefor, as may be evidenced by any receipt, judgment, or transcript thereof, and the amount of any expense reasonably incurred by it in defending any action brought by anyone entitled to recover on the document therefor.

(b) the consignor on a non-negotiable bill notwithstanding contraiy histructions from the consignee; or
(c) the consignee on a non-negotiable bill in the absence of contrary instructions from the consignor, if the goods have arrived at the billed destination or if the consignee is in possession of tlie bill; or
(d) the consignee on a non-negotiable bill if he is entitled as against the consignor to dispose of them. (2) Unless such instructions are noted on a negotiable bill of lading, a person to whom the bill is duly negotiated can hold the bailee according to the original terms.
§ 28:7--304. Bills of lading in a set
(1) Except where customary in overseas transportation, a bill of lading must not be issued in a set of parts. The issuer is liable for damages caused by violation of this subsection.
(2) Where a bill of lading is lawfully drawn in a set of parts, each of which is numbered and expressed to be valid only if the goods have not been delivered against any other part, the whole of the parts constitute one bill.
(3) Where a bill of lading is lawfully issued in a set of parts and different parts are negotiated to different persons, the title of the holder to whom thei first due negotiation is made prevails as to both the document and the goods even though any later holder may have received the goods from the carrier in good faith and discharged the carrier's obligation by surrender of his part.
(4) Any person who negotiates or transfers a single part, of a bill of lading drawn in a set is liable to holders of that part as if it were the whole set.
(5) The bailee is obliged to deliver in accordance with part 4 of this article against the first presented part of a bill of lading lawfully drawn in a set. Such delivery discharges the bailee's obligation on the whole bill.
§28:7--305. Destination bills

An unauthorized alteration or filling in of a blank in a bill of lading leaves the bill enforceable according to its original tenor.
§28:7--307. Lien of carrier
(1) A carrier has a lien on the goods covered by a bill of lading for charges subsequent to the date of its receipt of the goods for storage or transportation (including demurrage and terminal charges) and for expenses necessary for preservation of the goods incident to their transportation or reasonably incurred in their sale pursuant to law. But against a purchaser for value of a negotiable bill of lading a carrier's lien is limited to charges stated in the bill or the applicable tariffs, or if no charges are stated then to a reasonable charge.
(2) A lien for charges and expenses under subsection (1) on goods which the carrier was required by law to receive for transportation is effective against the consignor or any person entitled to the goods unless the carrier had notice that the consignor lacked authority to

726

PUBLIC LAW 88-243-DEC. 30, 1963

[77 STAT.

subject the goods to sucli charges and expenses. Any other lien under subsection. (1) is effective against the consignor and any person who permitted the bailor to have control or possession of the goods unless the carrier had notice that the bailor lacked sucli authority.
(3) A carrier loses his lien on any goods which he voluntarily delivers or which he unjustifiably refuses to deliver.
§28:7--308. Enforcement of carrier's lien
(1) A carrier's lien may be enforced by public or private sale of the goods, in bloc or in parcels, at any time or place and on any terms which are commercially reasonable, after notifying all persons known to claim an interest in the goods. Such notification must include a statement of the amount due, the nature of the proposed sale and the time and place of any public sale. The fact that a better price could have been obtained by a sale at a different time or in a different method from that selected by the carrier is not of itself sufficient to establish that the sale was not made in a commercially reasonable manner. If the carrier either sells the goods in the usual manner in any recognized market therefor or if he sells at the price current in such market at the time of his sale or if he has otherwise sold in conformity with commercially reasonable practices among dealers in the type oi goods sold he has sold in a commercially reasonable manner. A sale of more goods than apparently necessary to be offered to ensure satisfaction of the obligation is not commercially reasonable except in cases covered by the preceding sentence.
(2) Before any sale pursuant to this section any person claiming a right in the goods may pay the amount necessary to satisfy the lien and the reasonable expenses incurred under this section. In that event the goods must not be sold, but must be retained by the carrier subject to the terms of the bill and this Article.
(3) The carrier may buy at any public sale pursuant to this section.
(4) A purchaser in good faith of*^ goods sold to enforce a carrier's lien takes the goods free of any rights of persons against whom the lien was valid, despite noncompliance by the carrier with the requirements of this section.
(5) The carrier may satisfy his lien from the proceeds of any sale pursuant to this section but must hold the balance, if any, for delivery on demand to any person to whom he would have been bound to deliver the goods.
(6) The rights provided by this section shall be in addition to all other rights allowed by law to a creditor against his debtor.
(7) A carrier's lien may be enforced in accordance with either subsection (1) or the procedure set forth in subsection (2) of section 28:7--210.
(8) The carrier is liable for damages caused by failure to comply with the requirements for sale under this section and in case of willful violation is liable for conversion.
§28:7--309. Duty of care; contractual limitation of carrier's liability
(1) A carrier who issues a bill of lading whether negotiable or non-negotiable must exercise the degree of care in relation to the goods which a reasonably careful man would exercise under like circumstances. This subsection does not repeal or change any law or rule of law which imposes liability upon a common carrier for damages not caused by its negligence.
(2) Damages may be limited by a provision that the carrier's liability shall not exceed a value stated in the document if the carrier's rates are dependent upon value and the consignor by the carrier's

tariff is afforded an opportunity to declare a higher value or a value as lawfully provided in the tariff, or where no tariff is filed he is otherwise advised of such opportunity; but no such limitation is effective with respect to the carrier's liability for conversion to its own use.
(3) Reasonable provisions as to the time and manner of presenting claims and institutmg actions based on the shipment may be included in a bill of lading or tariff.

(5) Indorsement of a non-negotiable document neither makes it negotiable nor adds to the transferee's rights.
(6) The naming in a negotiable bill of a person to be notified of the arrival of the goods does not limit the negotiability of the bill nor constitute notice to a purchaser thereof of any interest of such person in the goods.

(3) Title to goods based upon a bill of lading issued to a (freight forwarder is subject to the rights of anyone to whom a bill issued by the freight forwarder is duly negotiated; but delivery by the carrier in accordance -with, part 4 of this article pursuant to its own bill of lading discharges the carrier's obligation to deliver.

(b) by a buyer from the transferor in ordinary course of business if the bailee has delivered the goods to the buyer or received notification of his rights; or
(c) as against the bailee by good faith dealings of the bailee with the transferor.

§ 28:8--^202. Issuer's responsibility and defenses; notice of defect or defense
(1) Even against a purchaser for value and without notice, the terms of a security include those stated on the security and those made part of the security by reference to another instrument, indenture or document or to a constitution, statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, order or the like to the extent that the terms so referred to do not conflict with the stated terms. Such a reference does not of itself charge a purchaser for value with notice of a defect going to the validity of the security even though the security expressly states that a person accepting it admits such notice.
(2) (a) A security other than one issued by a goverimient or governmental agency or unit even though issued with a defect going to its validity is valid in the hands of a purchaser for value and without notice of the particular defect unless the defect involves a violation of constitutional provisions in which case the security is valid in the hands of a subsequent purchaser for value and without notice of the defect.
(b) The rule of subparagraph (a) applies to an issuer which is a government or governmental agency or unit only if either there has been substantial compliance with the legal requirements governing the issue or the issuer has received a substantial consideration for the issue as a whole or for the particular security and a stated purpose of the issue is one for which the issuer has power to borrow money or issue the security.
(3) Except as otherwise provided in the case of certain unauthorized signatures on issue (section 28 :8--205), lack of genuineness of a security is a complete defense even against a purchaser for value and without notice.
(4) All other defenses of the issuer including nondelivery and conditional delivery of the security are ineffective against a purchaser for value who has taken without notice of the particular defense.

(5) Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the right of a party to a "when, as and. if issued" or a "when distributed" contract to cancel the contract in the event of a material change in the character of the security which is the subject of the contract or in the plan or arrangement pursuant to which such security is to be issued or distributed.
§ 28:8--^203. Staleness as notice of defects or defenses
(1) After an act or event which creates a right to immediate performance of the principal obligation evidenced by the security or which sets a date on or after which the security is to be presented or surrendered for redemption or exchange, a purchaser is charged with notice of any defect in its issue or defense of the issuer
(a) if the act or event is one requiring the payment of money or the delivery of securities or both on presentation or surrender of the security and such funds or securities are available on the date set for payment or exchange and he takes the security more than one year after that date; and
(b) if the act or event is not covered by paragraph (a) and he takes the security more than two years after the date set for surrender or presentation or the date on which such performance became due. (2) A call which has been revoked is not within subsection (1).
§ 28:8--^204. Effect of issuer's restrictions on transfer
Unless noted conspicuously on the security a restriction on transfer imposed by the issuer even though otherwise lawful is ineffective except against a person with actual Imowledge of it.
§ 28:8--^205. Effect of unauthorized signature on issue
An unauthorized signature placed on a security prior to or in the course of issue is ineffective except that the signature is effective in favor of a purchaser for value and without notice of the lapk of authority if the signing has been done by
(a) an authenticating trustee, registrar, transfer agent or other person entrusted by the issuer with the signing of the security or of similar securities or their immediate preparation for signing; or
(b) an employee of the issuer or of any of the foregoing entrusted with responsible handling of the security.
§28:8--^206. Completion or alteration of instrument
(1) Where a security contains the signatures necessary to its issue or transfer but is incomplete in any other respect
(a) any person may complete it by filling in the blanks as authorized; and
(b) even though the blanks are incorrectly filled in, the security as completed is enforceable by a purchaser who took it for value and without notice of such incorrectness. (2) A complete security which has been improperly altered even though fraudulently remains enforceable but only according to its original terms.
§28:8--^207. Rights of issuer with respect to registered owners
(1) Prior to due presentment for registriation of transfer of a security in registered form the issuer or indenture trustee may treat the registered owner as the person exclusively entitled to vote, to I'eceive notifications and otherwise to exercise all the rights and powers of an owner.

(1) A person placing his signature upon a security as authenticating trustee, registrar, transfer ageiit or tlie like wan-ants to a purchaser for value without notice of the particular defect tliat
(a) the security is genuine; and (b) his own participation in the issue of the security is within his capacity and witliin the scope of the authorization received by him from the issuer; and (c) lie has reasonable grounds to believe that the security is in the form and within the amount the issuer is authorized to issue.

PART 3--PURCHASE
§ 28:8--301. Rights acquired by purchaser; "adverse claim"; title acquired by bona fide purchaser
(1) Upon delivery of a security the purchaser acquires the rights in the security which his transferor had or had actual authority to convey except that a purchaser who has himself been a party to any fraud or illegality affecting the security or w^ho as a prior holder had notice of an adverse claim cannot improve his position by taking from a later bona fide purchaser. "Adverse claim" includes a claim that a transfer was or would be wrongful or that a particular adverse person is the owner of or has an interest in the security.
(2) A bona fide purchaser in addition to acquiring the rights of a purchaser also acquires the security free of any adverse claim.
(3) A purchaser of a limited interest acquires rights only to the extent of the interest purchased.
§28:8--302. "Bona fide purchaser"
A "bona fide purchaser'' is a purchaser for vakie in good faith and without notice of any adverse claim who takes delivery of a security in bearer form or of one in registered form issued to him or indorsed to him or in blank.
§28:8--303. "Broker"
"Broker" means a person engaged for all or part of his time in the business of buying and selling securities, who in the transaction concerned acts for, or buys a security from or sells a security to a customer. Nothing in this article determines the capacity in which a person acts for purposes of any other statute or rule to which such person is subject.
§ 28:8--304. Notice to purchaser of adverse claims
(1) A purchaser (including a broker for the seller or buyer but excluding an intermediary bank) of a security is charged with notice of adverse claims if
(a) the security whether in bearer or registered form has been indorsed "for collection" or "for surrender" or for some other purpose not involving transfer; or
(b) the security is m bearer form and has on it an unambiguous statement that it is the property of a person other than the transferor. The mere writing of a name on a security is not such a statement. (2) The fact that the purchaser (including a broker for the seller or buyer) has notice that the security is held for a third person or is registered in the name of or indorsed by a fiduciary does not create a duty of inquiry into the rightfulness of the transfer or constitute

77 STAT. ]

PUBLIC LAW 88-243-DEC. 30, 1963

737

notice of adverse claims. If, however, the purchaser (exchiding an intermediary bank) lias knowledge that the proceeds are being used or that the transaction is for the individual benefit of the fiduciary or otherwise in breach of duty, the purchaser is charged with notice of adverse claims.
§28:8--305. Stateness as notice of adverse claims
An act or event which creates a right to immediate performance of the principal obligation evidenced by the security or which sets a date on or after which the security is to be presented or surrendered for redemption or exchange does not of itself constitute any notice of adverse claims except in the case of a purchase
(a) after one year from any date set for such presentment or surrender for redemption or exchange; or
(b) after six months from any date set for payment of money against presentation or surrender of the security if funds are available for payment on that date.
§28:8--306. Warranties on presentment and transfer
(1) A person who presents a security for registration of transfer or for payment or exchange warrants to the issuer that he is entitled to Ihe registration, payment or exchange. But a purchaser for value without notice of adverse claims who receives a new, reissued or re-registered security on registration of transfer warrants only that he has no loiowiedge of any unauthorized signature (section 28:8--311) in a necessary indorsement.
(2) A person by transferring a security to a purchaser for value warrants only that
(a) his transfer is effective and rightful; and (b) the security is genuine and has not been materially altered; and (c) he knows no fact which might impair the validity of the security. (3) Where a security is delivered by an intermediary known to be entrusted with delivery of the security on behalf of another or with collection of a draft or other claim against such delivery, the intermediary by such delivery warrants only his own good faith and authority even though he has purchased or made advances against the claim to be collected against the delivery. (4) A pledgee or other holder for security who redelivers the seculity received, or after payment and on order of the debtor delivers that security to a third person makes only the warranties of an intermediary under subsection (3). (5) A broker gives to his customer and to the issuer and a purchaser the warranties provided in this section and has the rights and privileges of a purchaser under this section. The warranties of and in favor of the broker acting as an agent are in addition to applicable warranties given by and in favor of his customer.
§ 28:8--307. Effect of delivery without indorsement; right to compel indorsement
Where a security in registered form has been delivered to a purchaser without a necessary indorsement he may become a bona fide purchaser only as of the time the indorsement is supplied, but against the transferor the transfer is complete upon delivery and the purchaser has a specifically enforceable right to have any necessary indorsement supplied.

(1) An indorsement of a security in registered form is made when an appropriate person signs on it or on a separate document an assignment or transfer of tlie security or a power to assign or transfer it or when the signature of such person is written without more upon tlie back of the security.
(2) An indorsement may be in blank or speciah An indorsement in blank includes an indorsement to bearer. A special indorsement specifies the person to whom the security is to be transferred, or who has power to transfer it. A holder may convert a blank indorsement into a special indorsement.
(3) "An appropriate person'" in subsection (1) means (a) thfi person specified by the security or by special indorse-
ment to be entitled to the security; or (b) where the person so specified is described as a fiduciai-y
but is no longer serving in the described capacity,--either that person or his successor; or
(c) where the security or indorsement so specifies more than one person as fiduciaries and one or more are no longer serving in the described capacity,--the remaining fiduciary or fiduciaries, whether or not a successor has been appomted or qualified; or
(d) where the person so specified is an individual and is without capacity to act by virtue of death, incompetence, infancy or otherwise,--his executor, administrator, guardian or like fiduciary; or
(e) where the security or indorsement so specifies more than one person as tenants by the entirety or with right of survivorship and by reason of death all cannot sign,--the survivor or survivors; or
(f) a person having power to sign under applicable law or controlling instrument; or
(g) to the extent that any of the foregoing persons may act through an agent,--his authorized agent. (4) Unless otherwise agreed the indorser by his indorsement assumes no obligation that the security will be honored by the issuer. (5) An indorsement purporting to be only of part of a security representing units intended by the issuer to be separately transferable is effective to the extent of the indorsement. (6) Whether the person signing is appropriate is determined as of the date of signing and an indorsement by such a person does not become unauthorized for the purposes of this article by virtue of any subsequent change of circumstances. (7) Failure of a fiduciary to comply with a controlling instrument or with the law of the state having jurisdiction of the fiduciary relationship, including any law requiring the fiduciary to obtain court approval of the transfer, does not render his indorsement unauthorized for the purposes of this article.
§28:8--309. Effect of indorsement without delivery
An indorsement of a security whether special or in blank does not constitute a transfer until delivery of the security on which it appears or if the indorsement is on a separate document until delivery of both the document and the security.
§ 28:8--310. Indorsement of security in bearer form
An indorsement of a security in bearer form may give notice of adverse claims (section 28:8--304) but does not otherwise affect any right to registration the holder may possess.

§28:8--311. Effect of unauthorized indorsement
Unless the owner has ratified an unauthorized indorsement or is otherwise precluded from asserting its ineffectiveness
(a) he may assert its ineffectiveness against the issuer or any purchaser other than a purchaser for value and without notice of adverse claims who has in good faith received a new, reissued or re-registered security on registration of transfer; and
(b) an issuer who registers the transfer of a security upon the unauthorized indorsement is subject to liability for improper registration (section 28:8--404).
§ 28:8--312. Effect of guaranteeing signature or indorsement

(a) the signature was genuine; and (b) the signer was an appropriate person to indorse (section 28:8--308); and (c) the signer had legal capacity to sign. But the guarantor does not otherwise warrant the rightfulness of the |)articular transfer. (2) Any person may guarantee an indorsement of a security and by so doing warrants not only the signature (subsection 1) but also the rightfulness of the particular transfer in all respects. But no issuer may require a guarantee of indorsement as a condition to registration of transfer. (3) The foregoing warranties are made to any person taking or dealing with the security in reliance on the guarantee and the guarantor is liable to sucli person for any loss resulting from breach of the warranties.
§28:8--313. When delivery to the purchaser occurs; purchaser's broker as holder
(1) Delivery to a purchaser occurs when (a) he or a pereon designated by him acquires possession of a
security; or (b) his broker acquires possession of a security specially
indorsed to or issued in the name of the purchaser; or (c) his broker sends him confirmation of the purchase and also
by book entry or otherwise identifies a specific security in the broker's possession as belonging to the purchaser; or
(d) with respect to an identified security to be delivered while still in the possession of a third person when that person acknowledges that he holds for the purchaser; or
(e) appropriate entries on the books of a clearing corporation are made under section 28:8--320. (2) The purchaser is the owner of a security held for him by his broker, but is not the holder except as specified in subparagraphs (b), (c) and (e) of subsection (1). Where a security is part of a fungible bulk the purchaser is the owner of a proportionate property interest in the fungible bulk.
(3) Notice of an adverse claim received by the broker or by the l)urcliaser after the broker takes delivery as a holder for value is not effective either as to the broker or as to the purchaser. However, as between the broker and the purchaser the purchaser may demand delivery of an equivalent security as to which no notice of an adverse claim has been received.

§28:8--315. Action against purchaser based upon wrongful transfer
(1) Any person against whom tlie transfer of a security is wrongful for any reason, including his incapacity, may against anyone except a bona fide pui'chaser reclaim ])ossession of the security or obtain possession of any new security evidencing all or part of the same rights or have damages.
(2) If the transfer is wrongful because of an unautliorized indorsement, the owner may also reclaim or obtain possession of the security or new security even from a bona fide purchaser if the ineffectiveness of the purported indoi-sement can be asserted against him under the provisions of this article on unauthorized indorsements (section 28:8-^311).
(3) The right to obtain or reclaim possession of a security may be specifically enforced and its transfer enjoined and the security impounded pending the litigation.
§28:8--316. Purchaser's right to requisites for registration of transfer on books
LTnless otherwise agreed the tranferor must on due demand supply his purchaser with any proof of his authority to transfer or with any other requisite which nuiy be necessary to obtain registration of the transfer of the security but if the transfer is not for value a transferor need not do so unless the purchaser furnishes the necessary expenses. Failure to comply with a demand made within a reasonable time gives the purchaser the right to reject or rescind the transfer.
§28:8--317. Attachment or levy upon security
(1) No attachment or levy upon a security or any share or other interest evidenced thereby which is outstanding shall be valid until the security is actually seized by the officer making the attachment or levy but a security which has been surrendered to the issuer may be attached or levied upon at the source.
(2) A creditor whose debtor is the owner of a security shall be entitled to such aid from courts of appropriate jurisdiction, by injunction or otherwise, in reaching such security or in satisfying the claim by means thereof as is allowed at law or in equity in regard

bank or a nominee of either subject to the instructions of the clearing corporation; and
(b) is in bearer form or indorsed in blank by an appropriate person or registered in the name of the clearing corporation or custodian bank or a nominee of either; and
(c) is shown on the account of a transferor or pledgor on the books of the clearing corporation; then, in addition to other methods, a transfer or pledge of the security or any interest therein may be effected by the making of appropriate entries on the books of the clearing corporation reducing the account of the transferor or pledgor and increasing the account of the transferee or pledgee by the amount of the obligation or the number of shares or rights transferred or pledged.
(2) Under this section entries may be with respect to like securities or interests therein as a part of a fungible bulk and may refer merely to a quantity of a particular security without reference to the name of the registered owner, certificate or bond number or the like and, in appropriate cases, may be on a net basis taking into account other transfers or pledges of the same security.
(3) A transfer or pledge under this section has the effect of a delivery of a security in bearer form or duly indorsed in blank (section 28:8--301) representing the amount of the obligation or the number of shares or rights transferred or pledged. If a pledge or the creation of a security interest is intended, the making of entries has the effect of a taking of delivery by the pledgee or a secured party (sections 28:9--304 and 28:9--305). A transferee or pledgee under this section is a holder.

PART 1--SHORT TITLE, APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
§28:9--101. Short title This aiticle shall be known and may be cited as Uniform Commer-
cial Code--Secured Transactions.
§28:9--102. Policy and scope of article (1) Except as otherwise provided in section 28:9--103 on multiple
state transactions and in section 28:9--104 on excluded transactions, this article applies so far as concerns any personal property and fixtures within the jurisdiction of the District

77 STAT. 1

(a) to any transaction (regardless of its form) "which is intended to create a security interest in personal property or fixtures including goods, documents, instruments, general intangibles, chattel paper, accounts or contract rights; and also
(b) to any sale of accounts, contract rights or chattel paper. (2) This article applies to security interests created by contract including pledge, assignment, chattel mortgage, chattel trust, trust deed, factor's lien, equipment trust, conditional sale, trust receipt, other lien or title retention contract and lease or consignment intended as security. This article does not apply to statutory liens except as provided in section 28:9--310. (3) The application of this article to a security interest in a secured obligation is not affected 'by the fact that the obligation is itself secured by a transaction or interest to Avhich this article does not apply.
§28;9--103. Accounts, contract rights, general intangibles and equipment relating to another jurisdiction; and incoming goods already subject to a security interest
(1) If the office where the assignor of accounts or contract rights keep his records concerning them is in the District, the validity and I)erfection of a security interest therein and the possibility and effect of proper filing is governed by this article; otherwise by the law (including the conflict of laws rules) of the jurisdiction where such office is located.
(2) If the chief place of business of a debtor is in the District, this article governs the validity and perfection of a security interest and the possibility and effect of proper filing with regard to general intangibles or with regard to goods of a type which are normally used in more than one jurisdiction (such as automotive equipment, rolling stock, airplanes, road building equipment, commercial harvesting equipment, construction machinery and the like) if such goods are classified as equipment or classified as inventory by reason of their being leased by the debtor to others. Otherwise, the law (including the conflict of laws rules) of the jurisdiction where such chief place of business is located shall govern. If the chief place of business is located in a jurisdiction which does not provide for perfection of the security interest by filing or recording in that jurisdiction, then the security interest may be perfected by filing in the District. For the I)urpose of determining the validity and perfection of a security interest in an airplane, the chief place of business of a debtor who is a foreign air carrier under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, is the designated office of the agent upon whom service of process may be made on behalf of the debtor.
(3) If personal property other than that governed by subsections (1) and (2) is already subject to a security interest when it is brought into the District, the validity of the security interest in the District is to be determined by the law (including tlie conflict of laws rules) of the jurisdiction where the property was when the security interest attached. However, if the parties to the transaction understood at the time that the security interest attached that the property would be kept in the District and it was brought into the District within 30 days after the security interest attached for purposes other than transportation through the District, then the validity of the security interest in the District is to be determined by the law of the District. If the security interest was already perfected under the law of the jurisdiction where the property was when the security interest attached and before being brought into the District, the security interest continues perfected in the District for four months and also thereafter if within the four month period it is perfected in the District. The se-

748

[77 STAT.

ciirity interest'niay also be perfected in tlie District after tlie expiration of the four month period; in such case j)erfectioii dates from the time of perfection in the District. If the security interest was not perfected under the law of the jurisdiction where the property was when the security interest attached and before being brought into the District, it may be perfected in the District; in such case perfection dates from the time of perfection in the District.
(4) Notwithstanding subsections (2) and (8), if pei*sonal property is covered by a certificate of title issued under a statute of the District or any other jurisdiction which requires indication on a certificate of title of any security interest in the property as a condition of perfection, then the perfection is governed by the law of the jurisdiction which issued the certificate.
(5) Notwithstanding subsection (1) and section 28:9--802, if the office where the assignor of accounts or contracts rights keeps his records concerning them is not located in a jurisdiction which is a part of the United States, its territories or possessions, and the accounts or contract rights are within the jurisdiction of the District or the transaction which creates the security interest otherwise bears an appropriate relation to the District, this article governs the validity and perfection of the security interest and the security interest may only be perfected by notification to the account debtor.
§28:9--104. Transactions excluded from article
This article does not apply (a) to a security interest subject to any statute of the United
States such as the Ship Mortgage Act, 1920, to the extent that such statute governs the rights of parties to and third parties affected by transactions in particular types of property; or
(b) to a landlord's lien; or (c) to a lien given by statute or other rule of law for services or materials except as provided in section 2S :9--810 on priority of such liens; or (d) to a transfer of a claim for wages, salary or other compensation of an employee; or (e) to an equipment trust covering railway rolling stock; or (f) to a sale of accounts, contract rights or chattel paper as part of a sale of the business out of which they arose, or an assignment of accounts, contract rights or chattel paper which is for the purpose of collection only, or a transfer of a contract right to an assignee who is also to do the performance under the contract; or (g) to a transfer of an interest or claim in or under any policy of insurance; or (h) to a right represented by a judgment; or (i) to any right of set-off; or (j) except to the extent that provision is made for fixtures in section 28:9--813, to the creation or transfer of an interest in or lien on real estate, including a lease or rents thereunder; or (k) to a transfer in whole or in part of any of the following: any claim arising out of tort; any deposit, savings, passbook or like account maintained with a bank, savings and loan association, credit union or like organization.

§ 28:9--112. Where collateral is not owned by debtor
Unless otherwise agreed, when a secured party knows that collateral is owned by a person who is not the debtor, the owner of the collateral is entitled to receive from the secured party any surplus under section 28:9--502(2) or under section 28:9--504(1), and is not liable for the debt or for any deficiency after resale, and he has the same right as the debtor

(b) no filing is required to perfect the security interest; and (c) the rights of the secured party on default by the debtor are governed by the article on sales (article 2).

PART 2--VALIDITY OF SECURITY AGREEMENT AND RIGHTS OF PARTIES THERETO

§28:9--201. General validity of security agreement
Except as otherwise provided by this title a security agreement is effective according to its terms between the parties, against purchasers of the collateral and against creditors. Nothing in this article validates any charge or practice illegal under any statute or regulation thereunder governing usury, small loans, retail installment sales, or the like, or extends the application of any such statute or regulation to any transaction not otherwise subject thereto.

§28:9--202. Title to collateral immaterial
Each provision of this article with regard to rights, obligations and remedies applies whether title to collateral is in the secured party or in the debtor.

§28:9--^203. Enforceability of security interest; proceeds, formal requisites
(1) Subject to the provisions of section 28:4--208 on the security interest of a collecting bank and section 28:9--113 on a security interest arising under the article on sales, a security interest is not enforceable against the debtor or third parties unless
(a) the collateral is in the possession of the secured party; or (b) the debtor has signed a security agreement which contains a description of the collateral and in addition, when the security interest covers crops or oil, gas or minerals to be extracted or timber to be cut, a description of the land concerned. I n describing collateral, the word "proceeds" is sufficient without further description to cover proceeds of any character. (2) A transaction, although subject to this article, is also subject to chapter 20 of Title 2, relating to pawnbrokei's, chapter (> of Title 26, relating to money lenders, chai^ter 7 of Title 40, relating to liens

on iiiotor vehicles, and chapter 9 of Title 40, relatinjr to installment sales of motor vehicles, and in the case of conflict between the provisions of this article and any such statute, the provisions of such statute control. Failure to comply with any applicable statute has only the effect which is specified therein.
§ 28:9--204. When security interest attaches; after-acquired property; future advances
(1) A security interest cannot attach until there is agreement (subsection (3) of section 28:1--201) that it attach and value is given and the debtor has rights in the collateral. It attaches as soon as all of the events in the preceding sentence have taken place iniless explicit agreement postpones the time of attaching.
(2) For the purposes of this section the debtor has no rights (a) in crops until they are planted or otherwise become grow-
ing crops, in the young of livestock until they are conceived; (b) in fish until caught, in oil, gas or minerals until they are
extracted, in timber until it is cut; (c) in a contract right until the contract has been made; (d) in an account until it comes into existence.
(3) Except as provided in subsection (4) a security agreement may provide that collateral, whenever actjuired, shall secure all obligations covered by the security agreement.
(4) Xo security interest attaches under an after-acquired property clause
(a) to crops w^hich become such more than one year after the security agreement is executed except that a security interest in crops which is given in conjunction with a lease or a land purchase or improvement transaction evidenced by a contract, mortgage or deed of trust may if so agreed attach to crops to be grown on the land concerned during the period of such real estate transaction;
(b) to consumer goods other than accessions (section 28:9-- 314) when given as additional security unless the debtor acquires rights in them within ten days after the secured party gives value. (5) Obligations covered by a security agreement may include future advances or other value whether or not the advances or value are given pursuant to commitment.
§28:9--205. Use or disposition of collateral without accounting permissible
A security interest is not invalid or fraudulent against creditors by reason of liberty in the debtor to use, commingle or dispose of all or part of the collateral (including returned or repossessed goods) or to collect or compromise accounts, contract rights or chattel paper, or to accept the retui-n of goods or make repossessions, or to use, commingle or dispose of proceeds, or by reason of the failure of the secured party to require the debtor to account for proceeds or replace collateral. This section does not relax the requirements of possession where perfection of a security interest depends upon possession of the collateral by the secured party or by a bailee.
§28:9--^206. Agreement not to assert defenses against assignee; modification of sales warranties where security agreement exists
(1) Subject to any statute or decision which establishes a different rule for buyers or lessees of consumer goods, an agreement by a buyer or lessee that he will not assert against an assignee any Claim or defense which he may have against the seller or lessor is enforceable by an assignee who takes his assignment for value, in good faith and without notice of a claim or defense, except as to defenses of a type which may be asserted against a holder in due course of a negotiable instru-

nient under the article on commercial paper (article 3). A buyer MIIO as p a i t of one transaction signs both a negotiable instrument and a security agreement makes such an agreement.
(2) When a seller retains a purchase money security interest in goods the article on sales (article 2) governs the sale and any disclaimer, limitation or modification of the seller's warranties.
§ 28:9--^207. Rights and duties when collateral is in secured party's possession
(1) A secured party must use reasonable care in the custody and ])reservation of collateral in his possession. In the case of an instrument or chattel paper reasonable care includes taking necessary steps to preserve rights against prior parties unless otherwise agreed.
(2) Unless otherwise agreed, when collateral is in the secured party's possession
(a) reasonable expenses (including tlie cost of any insurance and payment of taxes or other charges) incurred in the custody, preservation, use or operation of the collateral are chargeable to the debtor and are secured by the collateral;
(b) the risk of accidental loss or damage is on the debtor to the extent of any deficiency in any effective insurance coverage;
(c) the secured party may hold as additional security any increase or profits (except money) received from the collateral, but money so received, unless remitted to the debtor, shall be applied in reduction of the secured obligation;
(d) the secured party must keep the collateral identifiable but fungible collateral may he commingled;
(e) the secured party may repledge the collateral upon t-enns which do not impair the debtor's right to redeem it. (3) A secured party is liable for any loss caused by his failure to meet any obligation imposed by the preceding subsections but does not lose his security interest. (4) A secured party may use or operate the collateral for the purpose of preserving the collateral or its value or pursuant to the order of a court of appropriate jurisdiction or, except in the case of consumer goods, in tlie manner and to the extent provided in the security agreement.
§ 28:9--^208. Request for statement of account or list of collateral
(1) A debtor may sign a statement indicating what he believes t-o be the aggregate amount of unpaid indebtedness as of a specified date and may send it to the secured party with a request that the statement be approved or corrected and returned to the debtor. Allien the se<urity agreement or any other record kept by the secured party identifies the collateral a debtor may similarly re(j[uest the secured party to approve or correct a list of the collateral.
(2) The secured party must comply with such a request within two weeks after receipt by sending a written correction or approval. If the secured party clanns a security interest in all of a particular type of collateral owned by the debtor he may indicate that fact in his reply , and need not approve or correct an itemized list of such collateral. If the secured party without reasonable excuse fails to comply he is liable for any loss caused to the debtor thereby; and if the debtor has properly included in his request a good faith statement of the obligation or a list of the collateral or both the secured party may claim a security interest only as shoAvn in the statement agamst persons misled by his failure to comply. If he no longer has an interest in the obligation or collateral at the time the request is received he must disclose the name and address of any successor in interest known to him and he is liable for any loss caused to the debtor as a result of failure to dis-

(8) A debtor is entitled to such a statement once every six months without charge. The secured party may require payment of a cliarge not exceeding $10 for eacli additional statement furnished.
PART 3~RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES; PERFECTED AND
UNPERFECTED SECURITY INTERESTS; RULES OF PRI-
ORITY
§28:9--301. Persons who take priority over unperfected security interests; "lien creditor"
(1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (2), an unperfected security interest is subordinate to the rights of

(2) If the secured party files with respect to a purchase money security interest before or within ten days after the collateral comes into possession of the debtor, he takes priority over the rights of a transferee in bulk or of a lien creditor which arise between the time the security interest attaches and the time of filing. (3) A "lien creditor" means a creditor who has acquired a lien on the property involved by attachment, levy or the like and includes an assignee for benefit of creditors from the time of assignment, and a trustee in bankruptcy from the date of the filing of the petition or a receiver in equity from the time of appointment. Unless all the creditors represented had knowledge of the security interest such a representative of creditors is a lien creditor without knowledge even though he personally has knowledge of the security interest.

§28:9--303. When security interest is perfected; continuity of perfection
(1) A security interest is perfected when it has attached and when all of the applicable steps required for perfection have been taken. Such steps are specified in sections 28:9--302, 28:9--304, 28:9--305, and 28:9--306. If such steps are taken before the security interest attaches, it is perfected at the time when it attaches.
(2) If a security interest is originally perfected in any way permitted under this article and is subsequently perfected in some other way under this article, without an intermediate period when it was unperfected, the security interest shall be deemed to be perfected continuously for the purposes of this article.
§ 28:9--304. Perfection of security interest in instruments, documents, and goods covered by documents; perfection by permissive filing; temporary perfection without filing or transfer of possession
(1) A security interest in chattel paper or negotiable documents may be perfected by filing. A security interest in instruments (other than instruments which constitute part of chattel paper) can be perfected only by the secured party's taking possession, except as provided in subsections (4^ and (5).
(2) During the period that goods are in the possession of the issuer of a negotiable document therefor, a security interest in the goods is perfected by perfecting a security interest in the document, and any security interest in the goods otherwise perfected during such period is subject thereto.
(3) A security interest in goods in the possession of a bailee other than one who has issued a negotiable document therefor is perfected by issuance of a document in the name of the secured party or by the bailee's receipt of notification of the secured party's interest or by filing as to the goods.
(4) A security interest in instruments or negotiable documents is perfected without filing or the taking of possession for a period of

PUBLIC LAW 88-243-DEC. 30, 1963

[77 STAT.

21 clays from the time it attaches to the extent that it arises for new value given under a written security agreement.
(5) A security interest remains perfected for a period of 21 days without filing where a secured party having a perfected security interest in an instrument, a negotiable document oi" goods in possession of a bailee other than one who has issued a negotiable document therefor

(b) delivers the instrument to the debtor for the purpose of ultimate sale or exchange or of presentation, collection, renewal or registration of transfer. (6) After the 21 day period in subsections (4) and (5) perfection depends upon compliance with applicable provisions of this article.
§ 28:9--305. When possession by secured party perfects security interest without filing
A security interest in letters of credit and advices of credit (subsection (2) (a) of section 28:5--116), goods, instruments, negotiable documents or chattel paper may be perfected by the secured party's i taking possession of the collateral. If such collateral other than goods covered by a negotiable document is held by a bailee, the secured party is deemed to have possession from the time the bailee receives notification of the secured party's interest. A security interest is perfected by possession from the tiipie possession is taken without relation back and continues only so long as possession is retained, unless otherwise specified in this article. The security interest may be otherwise perfected as provided in this article before or after the period of possession by the secured party.
§28:9--306. "Proceeds"; secured party's rights on disposition of collateral
(1) "Proceeds'' includes whatever is received when collateral or proceeds is sold, exchanged, collected or otherwise disposed of. The term also includes the account arising when the right to payment is earned under a contract right. Money, checks and the like are "cash proceeds". All other proceeds are "non-cash proceeds".
(2) Except where this article otherwise provides, a security interest <'ontiniies in collateral notwithstanding sale, exchange or other disposition thereof by the debtor unless his action was authorized by the secured party in the security agreement or otherwise, and also continues in any identifiable proceeds including collections received by the debtor.
(3) The security interest in proceeds is a continuously perfected security interest if the interest in the original collateral was perfected but it ceases to be a perfected security interest and becomes unperfected ten days after receipt of the proceeds by the debtor unless
(a) a filed financing statement covering the original collateral also covers proceeds; or
(b) the security interest in the proceeds is perfected before the expiration of the ten day period. (4) I n the event of insolvency proceedings instituted by or against a debtor, a secured party with a perfected security interest in proceeds has a perfected security interest
(a) in identifiable non-cash proceeds;

77 STAT. ]

PUBLIC LAW 88-243-DEC. 30, 1963

757

(I)) in identifiable cash proceeds in tlie form of money wliich is not commingled with other money or deposited in a bank account [)rior to the insolvency proceedings;
(c) in identifiable cash proceeds in the form of checks and the like which are not deposited in a bank accoimt prior to the insolvency proceedings; and
(d) in all cash and bank accounts of the debtor, if other cash j)r()ceeds have been commingled or deposited in a bank account, but the perfected security interest under this paragraph (d) is
(i) subject to any right of set-off; and (ii) limited to an amount not greater than the amount of any cash proceeds received by the debtor within ten days before the institution of the insolvency proceedings and commingled or deposited in a bank account prior to the insolvency proceedings less the amount of cash proceeds received by the debtor and paid over to the secured party during the ten day period. (5) If a sale of goods results in an account or chattel paper which is transferred by the seller to a secured party, and if the goods are i-eturned to or are repossessed by the seller or the secured party, the following rules determine priorities: (a) If the goods were collateral at the time of sale for an indebtedness of the seller which is still unpaid, the original security interest attaches again to the goods and continues as a psrfected security interest if it was perfected at the time when the goods were sold. If the security interest was orig.nally perfected by a filing which is still elective, nothing further is required to continue the perfected status; in any other case, the secured party must take possession of the returned or repossessed goods or must file. (b) An unpaid transferee of the chattel paper has a security interest in the goods against the transferor. Such security interest is prior to a security interest asserted under paragraph (a) to the extent that the transferee of the chattel paper was entitled to priority under section 28:9--308. (c) An unpaid transferee of the account has a security interest in the goods against the transferor. Such security interest is subordinate to a security interest asserted under paragraph (a). (d) A security interest of an unpaid transferee asserted under paragraph (b) or (c) must be perfected for protection against creditors of the transferor and purchasers of the returned or repossessed goods.
§ 28:9--307. Protection of buyers of goods
(1) A buyer in ordinary course of business (subsection (9) of section 28:1--201) other than a person buying farm products from a person engaged in farming operations takes free of a security interest created by his seller even though the security interest is perfected and even though the buyer knows of its existence.
(2) In the case of consumer goods and in the case of farm equipment having an original purchase price not in excess of $2,500 (other than fixtures, see section 28:9--313), a buyer takes free of a security interest even though perfected if he buys without knowledge of the security interest, for value and for his own personal, family or household purposes or his own farming operations unless prior to the I)urchase the secured party has filed a financing statement covering such goods.

§ 28:9--308. Purchase of chattel paper and non-negotiable instruments
A purcliaser of chattel i)aper or a non-negotiable instrument who gives new value and takes possession of it in the ordinary course of his business and without knowledge that the specific paper or instrument is subject to a security interest has priority over a security interest which is perfected under section 28:9--J504 (permissive filing and temporary perfection). A purchaser of chattel paper who gives new value and takes possession of it in the ordinary course of his business has priority over a security interest in chattel paper which is claimed merely as proceeds of inventory subject to a security interest (section 28:9--8()(>), even though he knows that the specific paper is subject to the security interest.
§28:9--309. Protection of purchasers of instruments and documents
Nothing in this article limits the rights of a holder in due course of a negotiable instrument (section 28:8--802) or a holder to whom a negotiable document of title lias been duly negotiated (section 28:7-- 501) or a bona fide purchaser of a security (section 28 :S--801) and such holders or purchasers take priority over an earlier secur ty interest even though perfected. Filing under this article does not constitute notice of the security interest to such holdei's or purchasers.
§28:9--310. Priority of certain liens arising by operation of law
When a person in the ordinary course of his business furnishes services or materials with respect to goods subject to a security interest, a lien upon goods in the possession of such person given by statute or rule of law for such materials or services takes [)ri()rity over a perfected security interest un'ess the lien is statutory and tiie statute expressly provides otherwise.
§28:9--311. Alienability of debtor's rights: judicial process
The debtor's rights in collateral may be voluntarily or involuntarily transferred (by way of sale, creation of a security interest, attachment, levy, garnishment or other judicial process) notwithstanding a provision in the security agreement prohibiting any transfer or making tlie transfer constitute a default.
§ 28:9--312. Priorities among conflicting security interests in the same collateral
(1) The rules of priority stated in the following sections shall govern where applicable: section 28:4--208 with respect to the security interest of collecting banks in items being collected, accompanying documents and proceeds; section 28:9--801 on certain priorities: section 28:9--304 on goods covered by documents; section 28:9--8()H on proceeds and repossessions; section 28:9--307 on buyers of goods; section 28:9--308 on possessory against non-possessory interests in chattel paper or non-negotiable instruments; section 28:9--809 on security interests in negotiable instruments, documents or securities; section 28:9--310 on priorities between perfected security interests and liens by operation of law; section 28:9--313 on security interests in fixtures as against interests in real estate; section 28:9--814 on security interests in accessions as against interest in goods; section 28:9--315 on conflicting security interests where goods lose their identity or become part of a product; and section 28:9--316 on contractual subordination.
(2) A perfected security interest in crops for new value given to enable the debtor to produce the crops during the production season and given not more than three months before the crops become growing crops by planting or otherwise takes priority over an earlier perfected security interest to the extent that such earlier interest

77 STAT. ]

PUBLIC LAW 88-243-DEC. 30, 1963

759

secures obligations due more than six months before tlie crops become irroAving crops by planting or otherwise, even though the person giving new value had knowledge of the earlier security interest.
(3) A purchase money security interest in inventory collateral has priority over a conflicting security interest in the same collateral if
(a) the purchase money security interest is perfected at the time the debtor receives possession of the collateral; and
(b) any secured party whose security interest is known to the holder of the purchase money security interest or who, prior to the date of the filing made by the liolder of tlie j)urchase money security interest, had filed a financing statement covering the same items or type of inventory, has received notification of the purchase money security interest before the debtor recei\es possession of the collateral covered by the purchase money security interest; and
(c) such notification states that the ])erson giving the notice has or expects to acquire a purchase money security interest in inventory of the debtor, describing such inventory by item or tyi)e. (4) A purchase money security interest in collateral other than inventory has priority over a conflicting security interest in the same collateral if the purchase money security interest is perfected at the rime the debtor receives possession of the collateral or within ten days thereafter. (5) In all cases not governed by other rules stated in this section (including cases of purchase money security interests which do not (pialify for the special priorities set forth in subsections (3) and (4) of this section), priority between conflicting security interests in the same collateral shall be detennined as follows:
(a) in the order of filing if both are perfected by filing, regardless of which security interest attached first under section 28:9-- 204(1) and whether it attached before or after filing;
(b) in the order of perfection unless both are perfected by filing, regardless of which security interest attached first under section 28:9--204(1) and, in the case of a filed security interest, whether it attached before or after filing; and
(c) in the order of attachment under section 28:9--204(1) so long as neither is perfected. (6) For the purpose of the priority rules of the immediately preceding subsection, a continuously j^erfected security interest shall be treated at all times as if perfected by filing if it was originally so perfected and it shall be treated at all times as if perfected otherwise than by filing if it was originally perfected otherwise than by filing.
§ 28:9--313. Priority of security interests in fixtures
(1) The rules of this section do not apply to goods incorporated into a structure in the manner of lumber, bricks, tile, cement, glass, metal work and the like and no security interest in them exists under this article unless the structure remains personal property under applicable law. The law of the District other than this subtitle determines whether and when other goods become fixtures. This subtitle does not prevent creation of an encumbrance upon fixtures or real estate pursuant to the law applicable to real estate.
(2) A security interest which attaches to goods before they become fixtures takes priority as to the goods over the claims of all persons who have an interest in the real estate except as stated in subsection
(3) A security interest which attaches to goods after they become fixtures is valid against all persons subsequently acquiring interests in the real estate except as stated in subsection (4) but is invalid against any person with an interest in the real estate at the time the

760

PUBLIC LAW 88-243-DEC. 30, 1963

[77 STAT.

security interest attaches to the goods who has not in writing consented to the security interest or dischiimed an interest in the goods as fixtures.
(4) The security interests described in subsections (2) and (3) do not take priority over
(a) a subsequent purchaser for vakie of any interest in the real estate; or
(b) a creditor with a lien on the real estate subsequently obtained by judicial proceedings; or
(c) a creditor with a prior encumbrance of record on the real estate to the extent that he makes subsequent advances if the subsequent purchase is made, the lien by judicial proceedings is obtained, or the subsequent advance under the prior encumbrance is made or contracted for without knowledge of the security interest and before it is perfected. A purchaser of the real estate at a foreclosure sale other than an encumbrancer purchasing at his own foreclosure sale is a subsequent purchaser within this section. (5) When under subsections (2) or (3) and (4:) a secured party has priority over the claims of all persons who have interests in the real estate, he may, on default, subject to the provisions of part 5, remove his collateral from the real estate but he must reimburse any encumbrancer or owner of the real estate who is not the debtor and who has not otherwise agreed for the cost of repair of any physical injury, but not for any diminution in value of the real estate caused by the absence of the ^oods removed or by any necessity for replacing them. A person entitled to reimbursement may refuse permission to remove until the secured party gives adequate security for the performance of this obligation.
§28:9--314. Accessions
(1) A security interest in goods which attaches before they are installed in or affixed to other goods takes priority as to the goods installed or affixed (called in this section "accessions") over the claims of all persons to the whole except as stated in subsection (3) and subject to section 28:9--315 (1).
(2) A security interest which attaches to goods after they become part of a whole is valid against all persons subsequently acquiring interests in the whole except as stated in subsection (3) but is invalid against any person with an interest in the whole at the time the security interest attaches to the goods who has not in writing consented to the security interest or disclaimed an interest in the goods as part of the whole.
(3) The security interests described in subsections (1) and (2) do not take priority over
(a) a subsequent purchaser for value of any interest in the whole; or
(b) a creditor with a lien on the whole subsequently obtained by judicial proceedings; or
(c) a creditor with a prior perfected security interest in the whole to the extent that he makes subsequent advances if the subsequent purchase is made, the lien by judicial proceedings obtained or the subsequent advance under the prior perfected security interest is made or contracted for without knowledge of the security interest and before it is perfected. A purchaser of the whole at a foreclosure sale other than the holder of a perfected security interest purchasing at his own foreclosure sale is a subsequent purchaser within this section.

(4) "When under subsections (1) or (2) and (H) a secured party luis an interest in accessions Which has priority over the chiinis of all persons who have interests in the whole, he may on default subject to the provisions of part 5 remove his collateral from the whole but lie must reimburse any encumbrancer or owner of the whole who is not the debtor and who has not otherwise agreed for the cost of repair of any physical injury but not for any diminution in value of the whole caused by the absence of the goods removed or by any necessity for replacing them. A person entitled to reimbursement may refuse permission to remove until the secured party gives adequate security for the performance of this obligation.
§ 28:9--315. Priority when goods are commingled or processed
(1) If a security interest in goods was perfected and subsequently the goods or a part thereof have become part of a product or mass, the security interest continues in the product or mass if
(a) the goods are so manufactured, processed, assembled or commingled that their identity is lost in the product or mass; or
(b) a financing statement covering the original goods also covers the product into which the goods have been manufactured, processed or assembled. In a case to which paragraph (b) applies, no separate security interest in that part of the original goods which has been manufactured, processed or assembled into the product may be claimed under section 28:9--314. (2) When imder subsection (1) more than one security interest attaches to the product or mass, they rank equally according to the ratio that the cost of the goods to which each interest originally attached bears to the cost of the total product or mass.
§ 28:9--316. Priority subject to subordination
Nothing in this article prevents subordination by agreement by any person entitled to priority.
§ 28:9--317. Secured party not obligated on contract of debtor
The mere existence of a security interest or authority given to the debtor to dispose of or use collateral does not impose contract or tort liability upon the secured party for the debtors acts or omissions.
§28:9--318. Defenses against assignee; modification of contract after notification of assignment; term prohibiting assignment ineffective; identification and proof of assignment
(1) LTnless an account debtor has made an enforceable agreement not to assert defenses or claims arising out of a sale as provided in section 28:9--206 the rights of an assignee are subject to
(a) all the terms of the contract between the account debtor and assignor and any defense or claim arising therefrom; and
(b) any other defense or claim of the account debtor against the assignor which accrues before the account debtor receives notification of the assignment. (2) So far as the right to payment under an assigned contract right has not already become an account, and notwithstanding notification of the assignment, any modification of or substitution for the contract made in good faith and in accordance with reasonable commercial standards is effective against an assignee unless the account debtor has otherwise agreed but the assignee acquires corresponding rights under the modified or substituted contract. The assignment may provide that such modification or substitution is a breach by the assignor. (3) The account debtor is authorized to pay the assignor until the account debtor receives notification that the account has been assigned

762

PUBLIC LAW 88-243-DEC. 30, 1963

[77 STAT.

and that payment is to be made to the assignee. A notification which does not reasonably identify the rights assigned is ineffective. If requested by the account debtor, the assignee must seasonably furnish reasonable proof that the assignment has been made and unless he does so the account debtor may pay the assignor.
(4) A term in any contract between an account debtor and an assignor which prohibits assignment of an account or contract right to which they are parties is ineffective.
PART 4--FILING

(3) A filing which is made in the proper place continues effective even though the debtor's residence or place of business or the location of the collateral or its use, whichever controlled the original filing, is thereafter changed.
(4) If collateral is brought into the District from another jurisdiction, the rules stated in section 28:9--103 determine whether filing is necessary in the District.
§28:9--402. Formal requisites of financing statement; amendments
(1) A financing statement is sufficient if it is signed by the debtor and the secured party, gives an address of the secured party from which information concerning the security interest may be obtained, gives a mailing address of the debtor and contains a statement indicating the types, or describing the items, of collateral. A financing statement may be filed before a security agreement is made or a security interest otherwise attaches. When the financing statement covers crops growing or to be grown or goods which are or are to become fixtures, the statement must also contain a description of the real estate concerned. A copy of the security agreement is sufficient as a financing statement if it contains the above information and is signed by both parties.
(2) A financing statement which otherwise complies with subsection (1) is sufficient although it is signed only by the secured party when it is filed to perfect a security interest in
(a) collateral already subject to a security interest in another jurisdiction when it is brought into the District. Such a financing statement must state that the collateral was brought into the District under such circumstances.
(b) proceeds under section 28:9--306 if the security interest in ! the original collateral was perfected. Such a financing statement

(2) A filed financing statement which states a maturity date of the obligation secured of five years or less is effective until such maturity date and thereafter for a period of sixty days. xVny other filed financing statement is effective for a period of five years from the date of filing. The effectiveness of a filed financing statement lapses on the expiration of such sixty day period after a stated maturity date or on the expiration of such five year period, as the case may be, unless a continuation statement is filed prior to the lapse. I^pon such lapse the security interest becomes unperfected. A filed financing statement which states that the obligation secured is payable on demand is effective for five years from the date of filing.
(3) A continuation statement may be filed by the secured party (i) within six months before and sixty days after a stated maturity date of five years or less, and (ii) otherwise within six months prior to the expiration of the five year period specified in subsection (2). Any such continuation statement must be signed by the secured party, identify the original statement by file number and state that the original statement is still effective. Upon timely filing of the continuation statement, the effectiveness of the original statement is continued for five years after the last date to which the filing was effective whereupon it lapses in the same manner as provided in subsection (2) unless another continuation statement is filed prior to such lapse. Succeeding continuation statements may be filed in the same manner to continue the effectiveness of the original statement. Unless a statute on disposition of public records provides otherwise, the filing officer may remove a lapsed statement from the files and destroy it.

PART 5--DEFAULT
§ 28:9--501. Default; procedure when security agreement covers both real and personal property
(1) When a debtor is in default under a security agreement, a secured party has the rights and remedies provided in this part and except as limited by subsection (3) those provided in the security agreement. He may reduce his claim to judgment, foreclose or otherwise enforce the security interest by any available judicial procedure. If the collateral is documents the secured party may proceed either as to the documents or as to the goods covered thereby. A secured party in possession has the rights, remedies and duties provided in section 28:9--207. The rights and remedies referred to in this subsection are cumulative.
(2) After default, the debtor has the rights and remedies provided in this part, those provided in the security agreement and those provided in section 28:9--207.
(3) To the extent that they give rights to the debtor and impose duties on the secured party, the rules stated in the subsections referred to below may not be waived or varied except as provided with respect to compulsory disposition of collateral (subsection (1) of section 28:9--505) and with respect to redemption of collateral (section 28:9--506) but the parties may by agreement determine the standards by which the fulfillment of tliese rights and duties is to be measured if such standards are not manifestly unreasonable:
(a) subsection (2) of section 28:9--502 and subsection (2) of section 28:9--504 insofar as they require accounting for surplus proceeds of collateral;

766

PUBLIC LAW 88-243-DEC. 30, 1963

[77 STAT.

(b) subsection (3) of section 28:9--504 and subsection (1) of section 28:9--505 which deal with disposition of collateral;
(c) subsection (2) of section 28:9--505 which deals with acceptance of collateral as discharge of obligation;
(d) section 28:9--506 which deals with redemption of collateral; and
(e) subsection (1) of section 28:9--507 which deals witli the secured party's liaoility for failure to comply with this part. (4) If the security agreement covers both real and personal property, the secured party may proceed under this part as to the personal property or he may proceed as to both the real and the personal property in accordance with his rights and remedies in respect of the real property in which case the provisions of this part do not apply. (5) When a secured party has reduced his claim to judgment the lien of any levy whicli may be made upon his collateral by virtue of any execution based upon the judgment shall I'elate back to the date of the perfection of the security interest in such collateral. A judicial sale, pursuant to such execution, is a foreclosure of the security interest by judicial procedure within the meaning of this section, and the secured party may purchase at the sale and thereafter hold the collateral free of any other requirements of this article.
§ 28:9--502. Collection rights of secured party
(1) When so agreed and in any event on default the secured party is ent'tled to notify an account debtor or the obligor on an instrument lo make payment to him whether or not the assignor was theretofore making collections on the collateral, and also to take control of any proceeds to which he is entitled under section 28 :9--306.
(2) A secured party who by agreement is entitled to charge back uncollected collateral or otherwise to full or limited recourse against the debtor and who undertakes to collect from the account debtors or obligors must proceed in a conmiercially reasonable manner and may deduct h's reasonable expenses of realization from the collections. If the security agreement secures an indebtedness, the secured party must account to the debtor for any surplus, and unless otherwise agreed, the debtor is liable for any deficiency. Rut, if the underlying transaction was a sale of accounts, contract rights, or chattel paper, the debtor is entitled to any surplus or is liable for any deficiency only if the security agreement so provides.
§ 28:9--503. Secured party's right to take possession after default
Unless otherwise agreed a secured party has on default the right to take possession of the collateral. In taking possession a secured T)arty may proceed without judicial process if this can be done without breach of the peace or may proceed by action. If the security agreement so prov'des the secured party may require the debtor to assemble the collateral and mnke it available to the secured party at a place to be designated by the secured party w^hich is reasonably convenient to both parties. Without removal a secured party may render equipment unusable, and may dispose of collateral on the debtor's premises under section 28:9--50 i.
§ 28:9--504. Secured party's right to dispose of collateral after default ; effect of disposition
(1) A secured party after default may sell, lease or otherwise dispose of any or all of the collateral in its then condition or following any commercially reasonable preparation or processing. Any sale of goods is subiect to the !^rt"cV, on sales (article 2). The proceeds of, disposition shall be applied in the order following to

77 STAT J

PUBLIC LAW 88-243-DEC. 30, 1963

767

(a) the reasonable exi>enses of retaking, holding, preparing for sale, selling and the like and, to the extent provided for in the agreement and not prohibited by law, the reasonable attorneysfees and legal expenses incurred by the secured party;
(b) the satisfaction of indebtedness secured by the security interest under which the disposition is made;
(c) the satisfaction of indebtedness secured by any subordinate security interest in the collateral if written notification of demand therefor is received before distribution of the proceeds is completed. If requested by the secured party, the holder of a subordinate security interest must seasonably funiish Treasonable proof of his interest, and unless he does so, the secured party need not comply with his demand. (2) If the security interest secures an indebtedness, the secured party must account to the debtor for any surplus, and, unless otherwise agreed, the debtor is liable for any deficiency. But if the underlying Transaction was a sale of accounts, contract rights, or chattel paper, the debtor is entitled to any surplus or is liable for any deficiency only if the security agreement so provides. (3) Disposition of the collateral may be by public or private proceedings and may be made by way of one or more contracts. Sale or other disposition may be as a unit or in parcels and at any time and place and on any terms but every aspect of the disposition including the method, manner, time, place and terms must be commercially reasonable. Unless collateral is perishable or threatens to decline speedily in value or is of a type customarily sold on a recognized market, reasonable notification of the time and place of any public sale or reasonable notification of the time after which any private sale or other intended disposition is to be made shall be sent by the secured party to the debtor, and except in the case of consumer goods to any other person who has a security interest in the collateral and who has duly filed a financing statement indexed in the name of the debtor in the District or who is known by the secured party to have a security interest in the collateral. The secured party may buy at aiiy public sale and if the collateral is of a type customarily sold in a recognized market or is of a type which is the subject of widely distributee! standard price quotations he may buy at private sale.
(4) When collateral is disposed of by a secured party after default, the disposition transfers to a purchaser for value all of the debtors rights therein, discharges the security interest under which it is made and any security interest or lien subordinate thereto. The purchaser takes fi'ee of all such rights and interests even though the secured party fails to comply with the requirements of this P a i l or of any judicial proceedings
(a) in the case of a public sale, if the purchaser has no knowledge of any defects in the sale and if he does not buy in collusion with the secured party, other bidders or the person conducting the sale; or
(b) in any other case, if the purchaser acts in good faith. (5) A person who is liable to a secured party under a guaranty, indorsement, repurchase agreement or the like and who receives a transfer of collateral from the secured party or is subrogated to his rights has thereafter the rights and duties of the secured party. Such a transfer of collateral is not a sale or disposition of the collateral under this article.

§28:9--505. Compulsory disposition of collateral; acceptance of the collateral as discharge of obligation
(1) If the debtor lias paid sixty per cent of the cash price in the case of a purchase^ money security interest in consumer goods or,sixty per cent of the loan in the case of another security interest in consumer goods, and has not signed after default a statement renouncing or modifying his rights under this part a secured party who has taken possession of collateral must dispose of it under section 28:9--504 and if he fails to do so within ninety days after he takes possession the debtor at his option may recover in conversion or under section 28:9-- 507(1) on secured party's liability.
(2) In any other case involving consumer goods or any other collateral a secured party in possession may, after default, propose to retain the collateral in satisfaction of the obligation. Written notice of such proposal shall be sent to the debtor and except in the case of consumer goods to any other secured party who has a security interest in the collateral and who has duly filed a financing statement indexed in the name of the debtor in the District or is known by the secured party in possession to have a security interest in it. If the debtor or other person entitled to receive notification objects in writing within thirty days from the receipt of the notification or if any other secured party objects in writing within thirty days after the secured party obtains possession the secured party must dispose of the collateral under section 28:9--504. In the absence of such written objection the secured party may retain the collateral in satisfaction of the debtor's obligation.
§28:9--506. Debtor's right to redeem collateral
At any time before the secured party has disposed of collateral or entered into a contract for its disposition under section 28:9--504 or before the obligation has been discharged under section 28:9^--505(2) the debtor or any other secured party may unless otherwise agreed in writing after default redeem the collateral by tendering fulfillment of all obligations secured by the collateral as well as the expenses reasonably incurred by the secured party in retaking, holding and preparing the collateral for disposition, in arranging for the sale, and to the extent provided in the agreement and not prohibited by law, his reasonable attorneys' fees and legal expenses.
§ 28:9--507. Secured party's liability for failure to comply with this part
(1) If it is established that the secured party is not proceeding in accordance with the provisions of this P a r t disposition may be ordered or restrained on appropriate terms and conditions. If the disposition has occurred the debtor or any person entitled to notification or whose security interest has been made known to the secured party prior to the disposition has a right to recover from the secured party any loss caused by a failure to comply with the provisions of this Part. If the collateral is consumer goods, the debtor has a right to recover in any event an amount not less than the credit service charge plus ten j)er cent of the principal amount of the debt or the time price differential plus ten per cent of the cash price.
(2) The fact that a better price could have been obtained by a sale at a different time or in a different method from that selected by the secured party is not of itself sufficient to establish that the sale was not made in a commercially reasonable manner. If the secured party either sells the collateral in the usual manner in any recognized market therefor or if he sells at the price current in such market at the time of his sale or if he has otherwise sold in conformity with reasonable commercial practices among dealers in the type of property sold

lie lias sold in a commercially reasonable maimer. The i)riiiciples stated in the two preceding sentences with respect to sales also apply as may be appropriate to other types of disposition. A disposition which has been approved in any judicial proceeding" or by any bona tide creditors' committee or representative of creditors shall conclusively be deemed to be commercially reasonable, but this sentence does not indicate that any such approval must be obtained in any case nor does it indicate that any disposition not so approved is not commerciallj^ reasonable.

THANKSGIVING DAY, 1962

By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation

November 7, 1962

Over three centuries ago in Plymouth, on Massachusetts Bay, the Pilgrims established the custom of gathering together each year to express their gratitude to God for the preservation of their community and for the harvests their labors brought forth in the new land. Joining with their neighbors, they shared together and worshipped together in a common giving of thanks. Thanksgiving Day has ever since been part of the fabric which has united Americans with their past, with each other and with the future of all mankind.

I t is fitting that we observe this year our own day of thanksgiving. I t is fitting that we give our thanks for the safety of our land, for the fertility of our harvests, for the strength of our liberties, for the health of our people. We do so in no spirit of self-righteousness. We recognize that we are the beneficiaries of the toil and devotion of our fathers and that we can pass their legacy on to our children only by equal toil and equal devotion. We recognize too that we live in a world of peril and change--and in so uncertain a time we are all the more grateful for the indestructible gifts of hope and love, which sustain us in adversity and inspire us to labor unceasingly for a more perfect community within this nation and around the earth.

I urge that all observe this day with reverence and with humility.
Let us renew the spirit of the Pilgrims at the first Thanksgiving, lonely in an inscrutable wilderness, facing the dark unknown with a faith borne of their dedication to God and a fortitude drawn from their sense that all men were brothers.
Let us renew that spirit by offering our thanks for uncovenanted mercies, beyond our desert or merit, and by resolving to meet the responsibilities placed upon us.
Let us renew that spirit by sharing the abundance of this day with those less fortunate, in our own land and abroad. Let us renew that spirit by seeking always to establish larger communities of brotherhood.
Let us renew that spirit by preparing our souls for the incertitudes ahead--by being always ready to confront crisis with steadfastness and achievement with grace and modesty.
Let us renew that spirit by concerting our energy and our hope with men and women everywhere that the world may move more rapidly toward the time when Thanksgiving may be a day of universal celebration.
Let us renew that spirit by expressing our acceptance of the limitations of human striving and by affirming our duty to strive nonetheless, as Providence may direct us, toward a better world for all mankind.

Proclamation 3511

EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION CENTENNIAL

December 28,1962

By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

W H E R E A S January 1, 1963, marks the centennial of the Proclamation in which President Abraham Lincoln declared all persons held as slaves in States or parts of States still in rebellion to be "then, thenceforward, and forever free"; and

W H E R E A S the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation marked the beginning of the end of the iniquitous institution of slavery in the United States, and a great stride toward the fulfillment of the principle of the Declaration of Independence that "all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness"; and

W H E R E A S the Emancipation Proclamation and the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments to the Constitution of the United States guaranteed to Negro citizens equal rights with all other citizens of the United States and have made possible great progress toward the enjoyment of those rights; and

W H E R E A S the goal of equal rights for all our citizens is still unreached, and the securing of these rights is one of the great unfinished tasks of our democracy:

NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, J O H N F . K E N N E D Y , President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim that the Emancipation Proclamation expresses our Nation's policy, founded on justice and morality, and that it is therefore fitting and proper to commemorate the centennial of the historic Emancipation Proclamation throughout the year 1963.

I call upon the Governors of the States, mayors of cities, and other public officials, as well as private persons, organizations, and groups^ to observe the centennial by appropriate ceremonies.

I request the United States Commission on Civil Rights to plan and participate in appropriate commemorative activities recognizing the centennial of the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation; and I also request the Commission on Civil Rights and other Federal agencies to cooperate fully with State and local governments during 1963 in commemorating these events.

I call upon all citizens of the United States and all officials of the United States and of every State and local government to dedicate themselves to the completion of the task of assuring that every Ameri-

can, regardless of his race, religion, color, or national origin, enjoys all the rights guaranteed by the Constitution and laws of the United States.

The purpose of this proclamation is to carry out a trade agreement supplementary to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,^ of

in the proclamation to carry out the provisions of the schedule. A copy of this agreement is annexed to this proclamation.
(2) Requisite Findings and Determinations and Applicable Procedures Regarding Agreement. Prior to entering into the trade agreement identified in paragraph (1) of this p a r t :
(a) Prior Findings. The President found that certain existing duties or other import restrictions of the United States or of foreign countries which are contracting parties to GATT, including the United Kingdom, were unduly burdening and restricting the foreign trade of the United States, and that the purposes of section 350 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U . S . C 1351), would be promoted by entering into such trade agreement.
(b) Compliance with Procedural Requirements. Eeasonable public notice was given of the intention to conduct trade agreement negotiations under G A T T with the governments of the foreign countries referred to in subparagraph (a) of this paragraph. Views presented by interested persons have been received and considered. Information and advice with respect to such negotiations has been sought from the Departments of State, Agriculture, Commerce, and Defense, and from other sources. Pursuant to section 3 of the Trade Agreements
Exteusiou Act of 1951, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1360), the President transmitted to the United States Tariff Commission for investigation and report lists of all articles imported into the United States to be considered for possible modification of duties and other import restrictions, imposition of additional import restrictions, or continuance of existing customs or excise treatment in trade-agreement negotiations with the governments of the foreign countries referred to in subparagraph (a) of this paragraph. The Tariff Commission made the investigations and reports of its determinations pursuant to section 3 within the time specified therein.
(c) Determination that Certain Rate Decreases Will Sim/plify Computation. The President has made the determination provided for in section 350(a) (3) (D) of the Tariff Act of 1930 that certain modifications of existing duties hereinafter proclaimed in part I I I of this proclamation, which reflect decreases in rates of duty exceeding the decreases specified in section 350(a) (4) (A) or (B), will simplify the computation of the amount of duty imposed with respect to the articles concerned.
(d) DetenminMion Rejecting Ad Valorem Equivalent of Certain Specific Rates. The President has made the determination respecting the ad valorem equivalent of the specific rate of duty (or combination of rates including a specific rate), and respecting the representative period, under the authority of section 350(a) (3) (D) and (4) (A) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, by reference to section 350 ( a ) ( 2 ) ( D ) ( i i ) of that act, in the case of each modification of an existing duty proclaimed in this proclamation for which such a determination was relevant, using, to the maximum extent practicable, the standards of valuation contained in section 402 or 402a of the Tariff Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1401a or 1402).
(3) Determination that Proclamation Required or Ap'^ropriate to Carry out Trade Agreement. I determine that the modifications of existing duties and other import restrictions of the United States, the additional import restrictions, and the continuance of existing customs and excise treatment of articles imported into the United States proclaimed in part I I I of this proclamation will be required or appropriate to carry out the trade agreement identified in paragraph (1) of this part.

Proclamation 3515

LAW DAY, U.S.A.--1963

By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation

January 25, 1963

The story of man's advance from savagery to civilization is the story of reason and morality displacing brutal force. While law is reason systematized, it is more than reason alone. A great justice of our Supreme Court said long ago, "The law is the witness and external deposit of our moral life. I t s history is the history of the moral development of the race."
In a time when all men are properly concerned lest nations, forgetting law, reason, and moral existence, turn to mutual destruction, we have all the more need to work for a day when law may govern nations as it does men within nations; when systematized reason may bring us a confident future; when the moral development of the human race may assure us a peaceful and law-abiding world.

I n 1961 the Congress by joint resolution wisely designated as "Law Day, U.S.A." the first day of each May. Thus, "Law Day, U.S.A." becomes the significant answer to Communism's May Day demonstrations, and calls on our people to rededicate themselves to ideals of equality and justice in their relations with one another and to the same ideals in relations with other nations.

NOW, T H E R E F O K E , I, J O H N F . K E N N E D Y , President of the United States of America, to support and emphasize this congressional resolution, do hereby request the people of our country to observe the first day of May, 1963, with such ceremonies and observances as will suitably signalize this great aspiration. I urge that civic and service organizations, schools, public bodies, and the media of information join in this educational observance, and further call upon all officials to display the nation's flag on public buildings on that day in token of our dedication to government under law.

IN W I T N E S S W H E R E O F , I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.

Proclamation 3523
THE WARSAW GHETTO UPRISING
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Of the more than 400,000 Jews whom the Nazis had previously walled into the Warsaw Ghetto, only about 70,000 remained in April of 1943. With deadly efficiency, most of the other inhabitants had been transported by the Nazis to concentration camps and had there been exterminated. The surviving Jews, suffering from malnutrition and disease, with pitifully few weapons and virtually no hope of assistance from any source, determined to sell their lives as dearly as possible. They engaged the Nazis in battle.
The result was known by the Jews to be foredoomed. Yet, though they lacked both military resources and a military tradition, they were able to conduct their struggle against the overwhelming forces of the Nazi occupiers for more than three weeks, thereby providing a chapter in the annals of human heroism, an inspiration to the peace-loving people of the world and a warning to would-be oppressors which will long be remembered.
NOW, T H E E E F O E E , I, J O H N F . K E N N E D Y , President of the United States of America, in consonance with the joint resolution of Congress approved August 28, 1962 (76 Stat. 407), do hereby invite the people of the United States to observe the twentieth anniversary

By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Dedication, devotion, and loyalty to our country and to the free democratic precepts upon which it was founded has always been a cherished tradition with our people--from our Founding Fathers to our servicemen now serving in the far-flung corners of the world. Understandably, our people avoid ostentatious displays of patriotic fervor. Nevertheless, in these trying times, when international forces are attempting to undermine and destroy our form of free government and our way of life, it is entirely fitting and proper and in the national interest to set aside a special day each year on which to express our unceasing devotion and loyalty to this Nation. To this end, the Congress, by a joint resolution of July 18, 1958 (72 Stat. 369), has designated May 1 of each year as Loyalty Day and has requested the President to issue a proclamation inviting the people of the United States to observe that day with appropriate ceremonies.
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, J O H N F . K E N N E D Y , President of the United States of America do hereby call upon the people of the United States, and upon all patriotic, civic, and educational organizations to observe Wednesday, May 1, 1963, as Loyalty Day, in schools and other suitable places with appropriate ceremonies in which all of our people may join in a reaffirmation of their loyalty to the United States of America.
I also call upon appropriate officials of the Government to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on that day as a manifestation of our loyalty to the Nation which that flag symbolizes.

Proclamation 3546
AMERICAN EDUCATION WEEK, 1963
By the President of fhe United States of America
A Proclamation
W H E R E A S the concept of free, universal education for all young people was, for the first time in the history of the world, translated into reality in this country, and this great advance has contributed immeasurably to the strength and prosperity achieved through American democratic principles; and
W H E R E A S our future progress in promoting peace and good will in the world as well as our future domestic progress in the constantly widening frontiers of medicine, science and the social sciences, industry, and the arts depend upon the fullest possible educational opportunity for all citizens; and
W H E R E A S the ability of our people to promote the domestic tranquility, as essential today as when our Nation was founded, depends in lar^e measure upon their awareness of historical forces and future directions which education imparts; and
W H E R E A S our national objectives require that each American, whether young or adult, have an opportunity to develop his highest potential for intellectual attainment and for full vocational or professional training to the extent his capabilities permit; and
W H E R E A S our educational system today is neither adequately adjusted nor adequately financed to meet present-day needs and thus fails to provide full educa,tional opportunities for all citizens; and
W H E R E A S the urgency and magnitude of the educational task before us make it imperative that every citizen actively support, and participate in, the accomplishment of that task:
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, J O H N F . K E N N E D Y , President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the period from November 10 through November 16, 1963, as American Education Week.
I call upon all Americans to inform themselves as to the quality of education and the opportunities for the individual which our schools, colleges, and universities now afford. I call upon all Americans to inform themselves of the problems which confront these vital institutions and to work toward the resolution of these problems with deep commitment and a sense of urgency. I remind my fellow citizens that the attainment of excellence in education is the responsibility of each one of us; that it is a responsibility to our society today, and an obligation to our citizens of the future.
IN W I T N E S S W H E R E O F , I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.

Proclamation 3547
NATIONAL FARM-CITY WEEK, 1963
gy j ^ g President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
W H E K E A S technology and science on the farm and in the marketing of farm products have made it possible for only eight percent of our civilian labor force to produce a superabundance of food and fiber; and
W H E R E A S , because fewer farm workers and fewer acres are required to feed and clothe a greatly increased population and to meet all export and foreign aid requirements, new economic opportunities are urgently needed for our youth in rural areas; and
W H E R E A S our increasingly urban society urgently needs open space and outdoor recreation; and
W H E R E A S these needs of all citizens can be more fully met through new and multiple uses of land not required for crop production and through wise use of all our soil, water, and forest resources; and
W H E R E A S the revitalization of rural areas and the development of rural resources for the benefit of all citizens are dependent in large part on a healthy rate of national economic growth and a national understanding of the ties that bind urban and rural America:
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, J O H N F . K E N N E D Y , President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week of November 22 through November 28,1963, as National Farm-City Week; and I call upon our citizens throughout the Nation to participate fully in the observance of that week.
I request that the leaders of labor unions, civic associations, business groups, and women's clubs, and all consumers join in this observance, along with farm and other rural people, as evidence of the interdependence and the strong ties that bind rural and urban citizens.
I urge the Department of Agriculture, the land-grant colleges and universities, the cooperative extension services, and all appropriate officials of the Government to initiate, and to cooperate with national. State, and local organizations in preparing and carrying out, programs for the appropriate observance of National Farm-City Week, including public meetings and discussions, exhibits, and press, radio, and television features, with special emphasis on the interdependence of rural and urban families and the opportunities accruing to all citizens through economic development of rural areas, including new and expanded outdoor recreation enterprises on farms, in small watersheds, and on privately owned forest lands.
I further urge that, whenever possible, urban and rural people exchange visits so that each will better understand the other.
IN WITNESS W H E R E O F , I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.

Proclamation 3559
NATIONAL DAY OF PRAYER, 1963
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Our forefathers declared the independence of our Nation "with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence." I n that reliance, they set forth the conviction that all men are created equal and endowed by their Creator with unalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
More than a century and three-quarters after our Nation was dedicated to that proposition, it may truly be reaffirmed that "We are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being." Conscious of the religious character of our people, the Congress of the United States by a joint resolution of April 17, 1952, provided that "The President shall set aside and proclaim a suitable day each year, other than a Sunday, as a National Day of Prayer, on which the people of the United States may turn to God in prayer and meditation, at churches, in groups, and as individuals."
NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I , J O H N F . K E N N E D Y , President of the United States of America, do set aside and proclaim Wednesday, the sixteenth day of October 1963, as the National Day of Prayer.
On this day, let us acknowledge anew our reliance upon the divine Providence which guided our founding fathers. Let each of us, according to his own custom and his own faith, give thanks to his Creator for the divine assistance which has nurtured the noble ideals in which this Nation was conceived.
Most especially, let us humbly acknowledge that we have not yet succeeded in obtaining for all of our people the blessings of liberty to which all are entitled. On this day, in this year, as we concede these shortcomings, let each of us pray that through our failures we may derive the wisdom, the courage, and the strength to secure for every one of our citizens the full measure of dignity, freedom, and brotherhood for which all men are qualified by their common fatherhood under God.

Proclamation 3560
THANKSGIVING DAY, 1963
By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Over three centuries ago, our forefathers in Virginia and in Massachusetts, far from home in a lonely wilderness, set aside a time of thanksgiving. On the appointed day, they gave reverent thanks for their safety, for the health of their children, for the fertility of their fields, for the love which bound them together and for the faith which united them with their God.
So too when the colonies achieved their independence, our first President in the first year of his first Administration proclaimed November 26,1789, as "a day of public thanksgiving and prayer to be observed by acknowledging with grateful hearts the many signal favors of Almighty God" and called upon the people of the new republic to "beseech Him to pardon our national and other transgressions * * * to promote the knowledge and practice of true religion and virtue * * * and generally to grant unto all mankind such a degree of temporal prosperity as He alone knows to be best."
And so too, in the midst of America's tragic civil war, President Lincoln proclaimed the last Thursday of November 1863 as a day to renew our gratitude for America's "fruitful fields," for our "national strength and vigor," and for all our "singular deliverances and blessings."
Much time has passed since the first colonists came to rocky shores and dark forests of an unknown continent, much time since President Washington led a young people into the experience of nationhood, much time since President Lincoln saw the American nation through the ordeal of fraternal war--and in these years our population, our plenty and our power have all grown apace. Today we are a nation of nearly tw^o hundred million souls, stretching from coast to coast, on into the Pacific and north toward the Arctic, a nation enjoying the fruits of an ever-expanding agriculture and industry and achieving standards of living unknown in previous history. W e give our humble thanks for this.
Yet, as our power has grown, so has our peril. Today we give our thanks, most of all, for the ideals of honor and faith we inherit from our forefathers--for the decency of purpose, steadfastness of resolve and strength of will, for the courage and the humility, which they possessed and which we must seek every day to emulate. As we express our gratitude, we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words but to live by them.
Let us therefore proclaim our gratitude to Providence for manifold blessings--let us be humbly thankful for inherited ideals--and let us resolve to share those blessings and those ideals with our fellow human beings throughout the world.
NOW, T H E E E F O R E , I, J O H N F . K E N N E D Y , President of the United States of America, in consonance with the joint resolution of the Congress approved December 26,1941, 55 Stat. 862 (5 U.S.C. 87b), designating the fourth Thursday of November in each year as Thanksgiving Day, do hereby proclaim Thursday, November 28,1963, as a day of national thanksgiving.
On that day let us gather in sanctuaries dedicated to worship and in homes blessed by family affection to express our gratitude for the glorious gifts of God; and let us earnestly and humbly pray that

November 23,1953

A Proclamation

To the People of, the United States:
John Fitzgerald Kennedy, 35th President of the United States, has been taken from us by an act which outrages decent men everywhere.
H e upheld the faith of our fathers, which is freedom for all men. H e broadened the frontiers of that faith, and backed it with the energy and the courage which are the mark of the Nation he led.

A man of wisdom, strength, and peace, he moulded and moved the power of our Nation in the service of a world of growing liberty and order. All who love freedom will mourn his death.

As he did not shrink from his responsibilities, but welcomed them, so he would not have us shrink from carrying on his work beyond this hour of national tragedy.

He said it himself: "The energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light our country and all who serve it-- and the glow from that fire can truly light the world."

Now, therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson, President of the United States of America, do appoint Monday next, November 25, the day of the funeral service of President Kennedy, to be a national day of mourning throughout the United States. I earnestly recommend the people to assemble on that day in their respective places of divine worship, there to bow down in submission to the will of Almighty God, and to pay their homage of love and reverence to the memory of a great and good man. I invite the people of the world who share our grief to join us in this day of mourning and rededication.

W H E R E A S many of the principles embodied in our Bill of Rights--freedom of speech, press, and assembly, freedom of religion and conscience, the right to a fair trial, and prohibition against cruel and unusual punishments--are likewise embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and are hailed by free peoples as the foundation of democratic government and of the rule of law; and

W H E R E A S the past year has seen a great surge of determination in this country to assure the full enjoyment of these rights and freedoms without distinction as to race, sex, creed, or color; and
W H E R E A S the ideals epitomized in the Bill of Rights and in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights were ever foremost in the heart of our gallant thirty-fifth President, John Fitzgerald Kennedy:

NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I , L Y N D O N B. J O H N S O N , President of the United States of Am.erica, do hereby proclaim December 10, 1963, as Human Rights Day and December 15, 1963, as Bill of Rights Day, and call upon the people of the United States to observe the week of December 10-17 as Human Rights Week. Let us set aside time, in our places of worship, in our schools, and in our homes, and at gatherings of civic and patriotic organizations, to examine once again these cherished documents of human rights in order that we may cultivate a greater appreciation of our heritage of individual liberty and responsibility.
Let us rededicate ourselves to the humanitarian precepts enumerated in those documents and let us resolve to devote our full energy to the task of assuring that each human being^regardless of his race, sex, creed, color, or place of national origin--shall be afforded a meaningful opportunity to enjoy fully the rights and benefits embodied in these instruments of liberty and to enjoy fully our heritage of justice under law. I n so doing, we will erect an everlasting and vibrant memorial to our departed President.

IN W I T N E S S W H E R E O F , I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.

A Proclamation

W H E R E A S diseases of the heart and the circulatory system are responsible for over one-half the deaths occurring annually; and

W H E R E A S over one-half of the ten million Americans afflicted by the cardiovascular diseases are stricken during their most productive years, thereby causing a staggering physical and economic loss to the nation; and

W H E R E A S expanded research has contributed improved methods of prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of the cardiovascular diseases; and

W H E R E A S substantial progress in combating those diseases is being made by comprehensive educational and community programs which have brought about swift and wide dissemination and use of such improved methods; and

W H E R E A S these programs of research and education have resulted largely from the teamwork between the American Heart Association, its chapters and affiliates, and the Federal Government, particularly the Publi'C Health Service through the National Heart Institute and the Heart Disease Control Program; and

W H E R E A S the results thus far achieved in combating the cardiovascular diseases give hope that the continuation and expansion of these programs may eventually eliminate these diseases as important causes of death; and

W H E R E A S it is essential to the health and well-being of our nation that our citizens be made aware of the medical, social, and economic aspects of the problem of cardiovascular diseases, and the measures being taken to combat them; and

W H E R E A S the Congress, by joint resolution approved December 30, 1963, has requested the President to issue annually a proclamation Ante, p. 843. designating February as American Heart Month:

UNITED STATES CUSTOMS YEAR

By the President of the United States of America

December 30. i963

A Proclamation

W H E R E A S August 1, 1964, marks the one hundred and seventyfifth anniversary of the signing by President George Washington of legislation establishing the United States Customs Service; and

W H E R E A S the United States Customs Service provided the principal revenues of the early Republic and assured its financial stability in its days of struggle; and

W H E R E A S the controls on imports and exports and on shipping and trade, deemed essential by the founders of the Republic, would have been impossible without implementation by a Customs Service, honest, resourceful, and efficient; and

W H E R E A S the Collector of Customs, the Custom House, and the Customs officer have stood for one hundred and seventy-five years as the symbols of Federal authority in the ports and on the waterfronts; and

W H E R E A S after one hundred and seventy-five years the ever more complex demands of our economy and our civilization require the Customs Service of the Treasury Department to remain alert and ready to perform on short notice a widening variety of tasks; and

W H E R E A S the Congress, by a joint resolution approved December 30,1963, has requested the President to issue a proclamation designating 1964 as the one hundred and seventy-fifth anniversary of the establishment of the United States Customs Service:

Ante. p. 843.

NOW, T H E R E F O R E , I, L Y N D O N B. J O H N S O N , President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the year 1964 as United States Customs Year; and I request the Bureau of Customs to plan and to participate in appropriate activities recognizing the anniversary to the end that it may serve as an occasion to commemorate the contributions of customs to the health and welfare of every citizen, to the national well-being, and to the development of a sound economy capable of leading the free world and assisting emerging nations.

I also call upon appropriate civic and industrial organizations to cooperate with the Customs Service in recognition of a century and three-quarters of mutually beneficial relationships.

I N W I T N E S S W H E R E O F , I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.

EXPLANATION
General.
The following tables are designed to serve as a guide to prior laws and other Federal instruments which are patently amended, repealed, referred to, or otherwise cited by the textual provisions of the public laws contained in this volume. These tables were initiated as a separate pamphlet to accompany Volume 70 of the United States Statutes at Large. Beginning with Volume 71, they are being published as an integral part of each volume.
From time to time the tables will be cumulated and made separately available as a convenience to users. Tables 1-9 of Volumes 70-74 covering the years 1956 through 1960 have been cumulated and published as a separate pamphlet. Coverage and arrangement of the tables are subject to change with a view to improved usefulness.
The arrangement of the tables is outlined above. There are two basic groups: (1) Tables 1-10 cover amendments, repeals, and other actions directly affecting prior laws and other Federal instruments; and (2) Tables 11-19 cover all citations and other references to prior laws and other Federal instruments.
Details of Arrangement.
Tables 1-9 are limited to cases in which prior laws and other Federal instruments are expressly affected.
Table 10 is a catch-all table designed as a finding aid to relationships which are expressed in general terms. Listed in this table are all public laws in this volume which contain such provisions as "notwithstanding any other provision of law," and "all laws in conflict with this law are hereby repealed."

1052

LAWS AFFECTED IN VOLUME 77

Tables 11-19 cover all other cases in which prior laws or other Federal instruments are mentioned in the text of the public laws in this volume, without regard to the purpose underlying such reference.
In each of the basic groups the first and largest table is entitled "General Legislation," and contains listings of all laws affected which have not been codified in the Revised Statutes, the Internal Revenue Codes, or in those titles of the United States Code which have been enacted into positive law. Succeeding tables cover these codified provisions, as well as other instruments such as reorganization plans, veterans' regulations, Executive orders and proclamations, and treaties and international agreements. The numbering of the tables in the two groups is parallel. Thus Table 2 and Table 12 both relate to the Revised Statutes; Table 7 and Table 17 both relate to veterans' regulations.
Table 1 is arranged chronologically. In preparing this table the "basic act" principle has been followed. Under this principle the key listing of amendatory legislation will be found under the basic act affected, rather than under intervening amendments thereto. Furthermore, all laws included are treated as if tables covering prior volumes of the United States Statutes at Large were in existence. Thus, no attempt is made to give an historical picture of a law, and only the latest amendment in the chain will be-reflected. Occasionally, to promote clarity, cross references have been supplied at key points.
Users of Table 1 should, therefore, look under the date, public law number, or statutes volume and page number of the basic act affected, in order to determine whether changes have been made by the public laws contained in this volume. Although a given section of any act may have been added at a later date, the section is carried under the date and statutes citation of the basic act. For this reason the page numbers in the column headed "Statutes volume and page" are the numbers of the page on which each act begins.
All tables are arranged chronologically, except where the existence of a system of codification makes possible a sequential arrangement from the lowest to the highest title or section number. In Tables 1-10 there is a "Comment" column, in which the nature of the affecting action is described. These are editorial comments, intended to reflect what is patent in the laws reviewed, and every effort has been made to avoid interpretations.
In Tables 11-19 the "Comment" column is unnecessary, since in each instance the comment would be "Cited" or "Referred to." In these tables, moreover, the number of columns has been held to a minimum in the interest of brevity. Thus Table 11 contains only three columns listing the date and number of the law referred to, and the page number in this volume at which the reference may be found.
Caveat.
All the tables are editorially compiled and presented as reference guides only. Hence they have no evidentiary status or legal effect. Indirect or implied relationships are not included. These may be found through use of the Subject Index or through research based on the text itself.
The Office of the Federal Register invites criticisms or suggestions with a view to improving the tables wherever possible.
