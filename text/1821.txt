[a) See note to the act of March 3, 1819, for the acts passed relating to the territory of Florida. The decisions of the Supreme Court upon the treaty between the United States and Spain of 22d of February, 1819, by which Florida was ceded to the United States, and upon the act of March 3, 1821,
have been: By the stipulations of a treaty, are to be understood its language and apparent intentions, manifested
in the instrument; with a reference to the contracting parties, the subject matter and persons on whom
it is to operate. United States v. Arredondo et al., 6 Peters, 710. The judiciary is not that department of the government to which the assertion of its interest against
foreign powers is confided; and its duty, commonly, is to decide upon individual rights according to those principles which the political departments of the nation have established. If the course of the nation has been a plain one, its courts would hesitate to pronounce it erroneous. However individual judges might construe the treaty of St. Ildefonso, it is the province of the Supreme Court of the United States to confine its decisions to the will of the legislature, if that will has been clearly expressed. Foster and Elam v. Neilson, 2 Peters, 307. United States v. Arredondo, 6 Peters, 710.
A treaty of cession is a deed of the ceded territory ;the sovereign is the grantor, and the act is his ; so far as relates to the cession the treaty is his act and deed, and all courts must so consider it; and
deeds are construed in equity by the rules of law. Ibid. 738. The Spanish version of the Florida treaty was in the words of the king, and expressed his intention ;
and though the American version showed the intention of the American government to be different, the Supreme Court cannot adopt it to decide what was granted by the king of Spain, what accepted and what reserved : the rules of law are too imperative to be disregarded or mistaken. The true interpretation of the Spanish language of the treaty is, that the grants of lands in Florida, made before the treaty,except those specially excepted, is that these grants remain confirmed.--The proprietors of such grants could bring suits to recover them without any action of Congress; and any question arising would
be purely a judicial question. Ibid. 741. The object of the treaty with Spain, which ceded Florida to the United States, dated 22d May, 1819,
was to invest the commissioners with full power and authority to receive, examine, and decide upon the amount and validity of asserted claims upon Spain, for damages and injuries. Their decision, within the scope of this authority, is conclusive and final, and is not re-examinable. The parties must abide by it, as the decree of a competent tribunal of exclusive jurisdiction. A rejected claim cannot be brought again under review in any judicial tribunal. But it does not naturally follow that this authority extends to adjust all conflicting rights, of different citizens, to the fund so awarded. The commissioners are to look to the original claim for damages and injuries against Spain itself; and it is wholly immaterial, who is the legal or equitable owner of the claim, provided he is an American citizen.
Comegys et al. v. Vasse, 1 Peters, 212. After the validity and amount of the claim has been ascertained by the award of the commissioners,
the rights of the claimant to the fund, which has passed into his hands and those of others, are left to the ordinary course of judicial proceedings, in the established courts of justice. Ibid. 212.
The treaty with Spain recognised an existing right in the aggrieved parties to compensation; and did not, in the most remote degree, turn upon the notion of donation or gratuity. It was demanded by our government as matter of right, and as such was granted by Spain. Ibid. 217.
Even in cases of conquest, it is very unusual for the conqueror to do more than to displace the sovereign and assume dominion over the country. The modern usage of nations, which has become law, would be violated; that sense of justice and of right, which is acknowledged and felt by the whole civilized world, would be outraged, if private property should be generally confiscated, and private rights annulled on a change in the sovereignty of the country, by the Florida treaty. The people change their allegiance, their relation to their ancient sovereign is dissolved ; but their relations to each other and their rights of property remain undisturbed. Had Florida changed its sovereign by an act containing no stipulation respecting the property of individuals, the right of property in all those who became subjects or citizens of the new government would have been unaffected by the change. It would have remained the same as under the ancient sovereign. United States v. Percheman, 7 Peters 51.
The language of the second article of the treaty between the United States and Spain, of 22d February, 1819, by which Florida was ceded to the United States, conforms to this general principle. Ibid.
The eighth article of the treaty must be intended to stipulate expressly for the security to private property, which the laws and usages of nations would, without express stipulation, have conferred. No construction which would impair that security, further than its positive words require, would seem to be admissible. Without it, the titles of individuals would remain as valid under the new government as they were under the old. And those titles, so far at least as they were consummated, might be asserted in the courts of the United States, independently of this article. Ibid.
The treaty was drawn up in the Spanish as well as in the English languages. Both are original,, and were unquestionably intended by the parties to be identical. The Spanish has been translated ; and it is now understood that the article expressed in that language is, that " the grants shall remain ratified and confirmed to the persons in possession of them, to the same extent," &c. ; thus conforming exactly to the universally received law of nations. Ibid.
If the English and Spanish part can, without violence, be made to agree, that construction which establishes this conformity ought to prevail. Ibid.
No violence is done to the language of the treaty by construction which conforms the English and Spanish to each other. Although the words " shill be ratified and confirmed," are properly words of

east and west Florida.
And remove Spanish troops, according to treaty.

United States be, and he is hereby, authorized to take possession of, and occupy, the territories of east and west Florida, and the appendages and appurtenances thereof; and to remove and transport the officers and soldiers of the king of Spain, being there, to the Havanna, agreeably to
the stipulations of the treaty between the United States and Spain, concluded at Washington, on the twenty-second day of February, in the year one thousand eight hundred and nineteen, providing for the cession

contract, stipulating for some future legislation, they are not necessarily so. They may import that  they shall be ratified and confirmed" by force of the instrument itself. When it is observed that in the counterpart of the same treaty, executed at the same time, by the same parties, they are used in
this sense, the construction is proper, if not unavoidable. Ibid. In the case of Foster and Elam v. Neilson, 2 Peters, 253, the Supreme Court considered those words
importing a contract. The Spanish part of the treaty was not then brought into view, and it was then supposed there was no variance between them. It was not supposed that there was even a formal difference of expression in the same instrument, drawn up in the language of each party. Had this circumstance been known, it is believed it would have produced the construction which is now given to
the article. Ibid. By the law of nations, the inhabitants, citizens, or subjects of a conquered or ceded country, ter-
ritory, or province, retain all the rights of property which have not been taken from them by the orders of the conqueror; and this is the rule by which we must test its efficacy according to the act of Congress, which we must consider as of binding authority. United States v. Clarke, 9 Peters, 168.
A treaty of cession is a deed or grant by one sovereign to another, which transferred nothing to which he had no right of property ; and only such right as he owned, and could convey to the grantee. By the treaty with Spain, the United States acquired no lands in Florida to which any person had lawfully obtained such a right, by a perfect or inchoate title, that this court could consider it as property under the second article; or which had, according to the stipulations of the eighth article of the treaty, been granted by the lawful authorities of the king ; which words, grants, or concessions, were to be construed in their broadest sense, so as to comprehend all lawful acts which operated to transfer a right of pro-
perty, perfect or imperfect. Ibid. The effect of the clauses of the confirmation of grants made was, that they confirmed them presently
on the ratification of the treaty, to those in possession of the lands ; which was declared to be, that legal seisin and possession which follows title, is co-extensive with the right, and continues till it is ousted by an actual adverse possession, as contradistinguished from residence and occupation. Ibid.
The United States, by accepting the cession under the terms of the eighth article, and the ratification by the king, with an exception of the three annulled grants to Allegon, Punon Rostro, and Vargas, can make no other exceptions of grants made by the lawful authorities of the king. Ibid.
The meaning of the words lawful authorities, in the eighth article, or competent authorities in the ratification, must be taken to be, " by those persons who exercised the granting power by the authority of the crown." The eighth article expressly recognises the existence of these lawful authorities in the ceded territories, designating the governor or intendant, as the case might be, as invested with such authority : which is to be deemed competent till the contrary is made to appear. Ibid.
By " the laws of Spain" is to be understood the will of the king expressed in his orders, or by his authority, evidenced by the acts themselves ; or by such usage and customs in the province as may be presumed to have emanated from the king, or to have been sanctioned by him, as existing authorized
local laws. Ibid. In addition to the established principles heretofore laid down by this court as the legal effect of an
usage or custom, there is one which is peculiarly appropriate to this case. The act of Congress giving jurisdiction to this court to adjudicate on these causes, contains this clause in reference to grants, &c., " which was protected and secured by the treaty, and which might have been perfected into a complete title, under and in conformity to the laws, usages and customs of the government under which the same originated." This is an express recognition of any known and established usage or custom in the Spanish provinces, in relation to the grants of land, and the title thereto, which brings them within a well established rule of law: that a custom or usage, saved and preserved by a statute, has the force of an express statute, and shall control all affirmative statutes in opposition, though it must yield to the authority of negative ones, which forbid an act authorized by a custom or usage thus saved and protected ; and this is the rule by which its efficacy must be tested, according to the act of Congress,
which must be considered of binding authority. Ibid. By the eighth article of the treaty ceding Florida to the United States, the same time is allowed to
the owners of land granted under the authority of Spain, to fulfil the conditions of their grants, after the date of the treaty as was limited in the grants. It has been decided by this court, in the case of Arredondo, that as to individual rights, the treaty is to be considered as dated at its ratification. United
States v. Sibbald, 10 Peters, 313. It has been decided, in Arredondo's case, that that provision of the treaty as to the performance of
the conditions in grants, is not confined to owners of land by occupancy or residence ; but extends to persons who have a legal seisin and possession of land, in virtue of a grant; and that, in the situation of the province, and the claimants to land at the time of the cession, it was enough that they should show a performance of the condition cy pres. Ibid.
In the construction of the Florida treaty, it is admitted that the United States succeeds to all those equitable obligations which we are to suppose would have influenced his Catholic majesty, to secure their property to his subjects, and which would have been applied by him in the construction of a conditional grant, to make it absolute ; and further, that the United States must maintain the rights of property under it, by applying the laws and customs by which those rights were secured, before Florida
was ceded ; or by which an inchoate right of property would, by those laws and customs, have been
adjudicated by the Spanish authority to have become a perfect right. United States v. Mills' Heirs, 12
Peters, 215.

SIXTEENTH CONGRESS. Sess .II. Res . 2. 1821.
II. Resol uti on providingfor jails in certain cases, for the safe custody ofper-
sons committed under the authority of the United States. (a)
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America, in Congress assembled, That where any state or states,

(a) The resolutions and acts of Congress relating to jails are : Resolution of September 23, 1789, vol. i. 96. Resolution of March 3, 1821. An act for the relief

of persons imprisoned for debt, Jan. 6, 1800, ch. 4. Act of May 19, 1828, ch. 68.

The cases decided within the courts of the United States on the laws of " escapes" are, A discharge from the prison rules, by the insolvent law of Virginia, although obtained by fraud, is a

discharge in due course of law : and upon such discharge, no action can be sustained upon the prison

bound bond for an escape. Simms and Wise v. Slacum, 3 Cranch, 300; 1 Cond. Rep. 539. The obligors in a bond for the prison limits, are not discharged from their liability for an escape, by

the subsequent assent of the plaintiff. Such assent, to have any effect, must be given prior to the

escape. Slocum et al. v. Hathaway, 1 Paine, 290. The condition of a bond, that a prisoner " shall faithfully and absolutely remain within the limits

of the jail, and not departtherefrom," &c. is not broken by the escape of the prisoner, while in a state

of insanity. Hazard v. Hazard et al. 1 Paine, 295. The liability of the sureties in a prison bounds bond, for an escape, is not co-extensive with that of

the sheriff: as it regards the latter, the prisoner on the limits is supposed to be in his immediate cus-

tody, and the escape of an insane prisoner, therefore, is as much a negligent escape as any other; and

he is not allowed to excuse himself, when he might so easily collude, or be imposed upon. But there

is no analogy, in these respects, between a sheriff and the sureties. Ibid. Under the act of Congress of January 6, 1800, ch. 4, the sheriff of a county is bound to take a

bond for the limits, as provided by the state laws, from a prisoner confined on process from the courts

of the United States ; and false imprisonment would lie, on his refusal. Such a bond has, in all

respects, the same incidents, and the like legal effect with a bond taken under the state laws. It is

assignable ; and an assignment discharges the sheriff from liability for a subsequent escape. The United

States v. Noah, 1 Paine, 368. The United States are expressly named in the act, and bound by it; and an assignment of the bond

to them, when they are plaintiffs, is valid. Ibid. The Secretary of the Treasury having accepted such an assignment, will be presumed to be author-

ized ; and the United States are bound by such acceptance. Ibid. The term " process," includes executions as well as mesne process. Ibid.

After a prisoner has been enlarged upon a limit bond, the sheriff can confine him again only on the

bail's becoming insufficient; he cannot accept a surrender of him; at all events, not after the assign-

ment of the bond. Ibid. If a debtor, committed to the state jail under process from the courts of the United States, escape,

the marshal is not liable. Randolphs. Donaldson, 9 Cranch, 76; 3 Cond. Rep. 280. The act of Congress has limited the responsibility of the marshal to his own acts, and the acts of his

deputies. The keeper of a state jail is, neither in fact nor in law, the deputy of the marshal; he is not

appointed by, nor removable at the will of the marshal. When a prisoner is regularly committed

to a state jail by the marshal, he is no longer in the custody of the marshal, or controllable by him.

Ibid. Under the laws of Rhode Island, a discharge according to the act for the relief of poor prisoners for
debt, although obtained by fraud and perjury, is a lawful discharge, and notan escape; and upon such

a discharge, no action can be maintained upon a bond for the liberty of the prison limits. Ammidon v.

Smith et al. 1 Wheat. 447 ; 3 Cond. Rep. 619. At common law, it is not an escape for a jailer to allow prisoners, confined for debt, the liberty of

all the apartments within the jail wall; for confinement within the walls, is salva et arcta custodia.

Steere v. Field, 2 Mason's C. C. R. 486. It is an escape, in the jailer, to make a prisoner for debt, a turnkey; and to intrust him with the

keys of the outer doors, as well as inner doors, at all times by night and by day. Ibid.

If the jailer be committed to his own jail, on execution by the sheriff, and no new keeper is

appointed, it is an escape of the jailer, for which the sheriff is answerable ; but it is not an escape of

the other prisoners, if they are in fact kept in custody, under the authority of the jailer or his agents.

Ibid.

..

In Rhode Island, the doctrine as to escapes is the same as at common law ; and the statutes giving

the liberty of the limits to prisoners, on giving bonds not to escape, &c. have not altered the common

law. In Rhode Island, an action of debt for an escape, is a legal remedy; that action being incorpo-

rated into the laws, by implication, by the adoption of the laws of England. Ibid. Where the conditions of a bond for the jail limits, in Rhode Island, required the party to remain a

true prisoner in the custody of the keeper of the prison, and within the limits of the prison, " until he,

shall be lawfully discharged, without committing any manner of escape or escapes, during the time of

charge under the insolvent laws of the state, obtained from the proper court, in pursuance of a resolu-

tion of the legislature, and discharging the party from all his debts, &c. and " from all imprisonment, arrest, and restraint of his person therefor," was a lawful discharge; and that his going at large under

it, was no breach of the condition of the bond. Mason v. Haile, 12 Wheat. 370 ; 6 Cond. Rep. 535.

After judgment obtained in the circuit court of the United States against the drawer of a. note, a capias

ad satisfaciendum was issued against him by the holder, and he was put in prison. Two justices of the

peace ordered his discharge, claiming to proceed according to the law of Kentucky, in the case of

insolvent debtors ; and the jailer permitted him to leave the prison. The jailer made himself and his

securities liable for an escape, by permitting the prisoner to leave the prison. Bank of the United States

having complied with the recommendation of Congress, in the resolution of the twenty-third day of September, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine, shall have withdrawn, or shall hereafter withdraw, either in whole or in part, the use of their jails for prisoners committed under the authority of the United States, the marshal in such state or states, under the direction of the judge of the district, shall be, and hereby is, authorized and required to hire a convenient place to serve as a temporary jail, and to make the necessary provision for the safe keeping of prisoners committed under the authority of the United States, until permanent provision shall be made by law for that purpose; and the said marshal shall be allowed his reasonable expenses, incurred for the above purposes, to be paid out of the treasury of the United States.

debtors imprisoned on execution issuing from the courts of the United States, are now regulated. The United States v. Knight et al., 3 Sumners' C. C. R. 358.
The act of 1828, ch. 68, has adopted the state laws on the subject of jail liberties then existing in the states, under the words " that writs of execution and other final process issued on judgment and decrees rendered in any of the courts of the United States and the proceedings thereon shall be the same, &c., as are now used in such states," &c. Ibid.
Action on a bond given to the United States for liberty of the jail-yard, in Portland, in the state of Maine. The condition of the bond was that J. K. and B. K. should continue true prisoners, in the custody of the jailer, within the limits of the jail-yard. It was agreed by the counsel of the plaintiff and defendant that J. K. and B. K. had remained' within " the limits of the jail-yard" as established
under the laws of Massachusetts of 1787, then prevailing in Maine, the limits of the jail-yard having, in October, 1798, been extended over the whole county; but had not remained within the limits established on the 28th of May, 1787, and existing when the act of Congress was passed, 4th January, 1800, authorizing persons under process from the United States, to have " the jail limits," as established by the laws of the states. Held, that the act of Congress of May 19, 1828, gives the debtor imprisoned under execution from the courts of the United States, at the suit of the United States, the privilege of the jail limits, in the several states, as they were fixed by laws of the several states at the date of that act. The United States v. Knight et al. 14 Peters, 301.
Whatever might be the liability of the officer who took the bond from the defendants, ifthe jail limits continued to be such as were established under the law of Massachusetts of 1787, the bond not having been taken under that law, and the condition being different from the requirements of those regulations, the parties to the bond, the suit being upon the bond, are bound for nothing whatever, but what is contained in the condition, whether it be or be not conformable to the law. Ibid.
The statute of May 19, 1828, entitled "An act to regulate process in the courts of the United States," which proposes only to regulate the mode of proceeding in civil cases, does not divest the public of any right, does not violate any principle of public policy, but on the contrary makes a provision with the policy which the government has vindicated by many acts of previous legislation, to conform to the laws of the state, in giving to persons imprisoned under execution the privilege of jail limits, embracing executions at the suit of the United States. Ibid.
Action for an escape against the sheriff of Madison, Mississippi, he having received into his custody as a prisoner, the defendant in an action in the circuit court of Mississippi, taken under execution, and having permitted and suffered him to escape. The declaration set out the judgment obtained by the plaintiffs against Scott, the defendant in the circuit court, the execution, the arrest of Scott, and his delivery to Long, the sheriff, who received him into his custody under the execution, and detained him, until, without leave or license of the plaintiffs in the execution, and against their will, he permitted him to escape and go at large, &c., &c. To this declaration the defendant pleaded that he does not owe the sum of money demanded in the declaration " in the manner and form as complained against him," and the jury found that the defendant Long " doth owe the debt in the declaration mentioned as therein alleged," and assessed damages for the detention thereof, at one thousand and sixteen dollars and ninety-six cents, upon which the court gave judgment for six thousand three hundred and fifty-six dollars, and one thousand and sixteen dollars and ninety-six cents damages. Held, that the judgment of the circuit court is correct under the provisions of the statute of Mississippi of 7th June, 1822. The jury were not required in the action to find specially that the prisoner escaped with the consent, and through the negligence ofthe sheriff. The plea alleged that the defendant did not owe the sum of money demanded/4 in the manner and form as the plaintiff complained against him." This plea put in issue every material averment in the declaration; on this issue, on the most strict and rigid construction, the jury have expressly found all that is required to be found by the requirements of the act. Long v. Palmer et al. 16 Peters, 65.
If the sheriff suffers or permits a prisoner to escape, this, both in common parlance, and legal intendment, is an escape with the consent of the sheriff. Ibid.
The object of the act is to make the sheriff liable for a voluntary or negligent escape ; and that this shall be found by the jury; and if this appear from the record by express finding, or by the necessary conclusion of law, it is sufficient. Ibid.

of the constitution, submitted on the part of said State to Congress, shall never be construed to authorize the passage of any law, and that no law shall be passed in conformity thereto, by which any citizen of either of the States of
