ADVERTISEMENT.

In publishing the following Laws, the same plan has been adopted that was prescribed in the Joint Resolution of Congress of March 3, 1845, authorizing a subscription to the edition of all the Laws of the United States published by us. A close examination of this volume will disclose some apparent errors in the Laws as here printed; but as we procure a careful collation with the records at Washington by an experienced reader of the Department of State, and scrupulously follow the original, any seeming errors must be attributed to the Rolls, and not to us. Where anything absolutely necessary to the sense is omitted in the Rolls, it is inserted in the text, enclosed in brackets.

We intend to publish annually, and as soon after the close of each Session of Congress as is possible, the Acts of that Session, in a similar form and with a similar arrangement.

It will be seen, by the following extract from the Act of Congress, August 8th, 1846, and Joint Resolution of September 26, 1850, that our edition has been sanctioned by Congress, and is the Offici al Edi ti on .

"And whereas said edition of the said Law s an d Tre ati es of th e Uni te d Stat es has been carefully collated and compared with the original Rolls in the Archives of the Government, under the inspection and supervision of the AttorneyGeneral of the United States, as duly certified by that officer: therefore, Be it further enacted, that said edition of the Law s an d Trea ti es of th e Uni ted Sta te s , published by Lit tle & Brow n , is hereby declared to be competent evidence of the several Public and Private Acts of Congress, and of the several Treaties therein contained, in all the Courts of Law and Equity and Maritime Jurisdiction, and in all the Tribunals and Public Offices of the United States and of the several States, without any further proof or authentication thereof. Approv ed , August 8, 1846."

" Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the Secretary of State be authorized and directed to contract with Litt le & Brow n to furnish their annual Statutes at Large, printed in conformity with the plan adopted by Congress in eighteen hundred and forty-five, instead of the edition usually issued by his order, under the act of Congress of April twentieth, eighteen hundred and eighteen, and which conforms to an edition of the laws now out of use. -- Approv ed , September 26, 1850."

Wher ea s , by the proclamations of the President of the nineteenth and twenty-seventh of April, eighteen hundred and sixty-one, a blockade of certain ports of the United States was set on foot; but, whereas, the reasons for that
measure have ceased to exist: Now, therefore, be it known, that I, And re w John son , President of the
United States, do hereby declare and proclaim the blockade aforesaid to be
rescinded as to all the ports aforesaid, including that of Galveston and other ports west of the Mississippi River, which ports will be open to foreign commerce on the first of July next, on the terms and conditions set forth in my
Proclamation of the twenty-second of May last. It is to be understood, however, that the blockade thus rescinded was an
international measure for the purpose of protecting the sovereign rights of the United States. The greater or less subversion of civil authority in the region to which it applied, and the impracticability of at once restoring that in due efficiency, may, for a season, make it advisable to employ the army and navy of
the United States towards carrying the laws into effect, wherever such employment may be necessary.

Blockade rescinded.
Ante, p. 757. Purposes of the blockade.

Wher ea s , by the proclamations of the President of the nineteenth and twenty-seventh of April, eighteen hundred and sixty-one, a blockade of certain ports of the United States was set on foot; but, whereas, the reasons for that
measure have ceased to exist: Now, therefore, be it known, that I, And re w John son , President of the
United States, do hereby declare and proclaim the blockade aforesaid to be
rescinded as to all the ports aforesaid, including that of Galveston and other ports west of the Mississippi River, which ports will be open to foreign commerce on the first of July next, on the terms and conditions set forth in my
Proclamation of the twenty-second of May last. It is to be understood, however, that the blockade thus rescinded was an
international measure for the purpose of protecting the sovereign rights of the United States. The greater or less subversion of civil authority in the region to which it applied, and the impracticability of at once restoring that in due efficiency, may, for a season, make it advisable to employ the army and navy of
the United States towards carrying the laws into effect, wherever such employment may be necessary.
In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.

Wher ea s it has been the desire of the general government of the United States to restore unrestricted commercial intercourse between and in the several states, as soon as the same could be safely done in view of resistance to the authority of the United States by combinations of armed insurgents ;
And whereas that desire has been shown in my proclamations of the twentyninth of April,1 one thousand eight hundred and sixty-five, the thirteenth of June, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-five, and the twenty-third of June, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-five ;
And whereas it now seems expedient and proper to remove restrictions upon internal, domestic, and coastwise trade and commercial intercourse between and within the states and territories west of the Mississippi River :
Now, therefore, be it known, that I, And re w Johnson , President of the United States, do 'hereby declare that all restrictions upon internal, domestic, and coastwise intercourse and trade, and upon the purchase and removal of
products of states and parts of states and territories heretofore declared in insurrection, lying west of the Mississippi River (excepting only those relating to property heretofore purchased by the agents, or captured by or surrendered
to the forces of the United States, and to the transportation thereto or therein, on private account, of arms, ammunition, all articles from which ammunition is made, gray uniforms and gray cloth), are annulled; and I do hereby direct
that they be forthwith removed; and also that the commerce of such states, and parts of states, shall be conducted under the supervision of the regularly appointed officers of the customs, [who] shall receive any captured and aban-
doned property that may be turned over to them, under the law, by the military or naval forces of the United States, and dispose of the same in accordance with instructions on the subject, issued by the Secretary of the Treasury.

revolting form, but whose organized and armed forces have now been almost entirely overcome, has, in its revolutionary progress, deprived the people of the
State of South Carolina of all civil government; and whereas it becomes necessary and proper to carry out and enforce the obligations of the United States to

Now, therefore, in obedience to the high and solemn duties imposed upon me by the Constitution of the United States, and for the purpose of enabling the

scribe the qualification of electors, and the eligibility of persons to hold office under the constitution and laws of the state, -- a power the people of the several
states composing the Federal Union have rightfully exercised from the origin
of the government to the present time. And I do hereby direct --
First. That the military commander of the department, and all officers and

abstain from, in any way, hindering, impeding, or discouraging the loyal people from the organization of a state government as herein authorized.

Fifth. That the district judge for the judicial district in which South Carolina is included proceed to hold courts within said state, in accordance with the pro-
visions of the act of congress. The Attorney-General will instruct the proper

Patriotic citizens exhorted to aid in restoring soldiers to their regiments.

And whereas, evil disposed and disloyal persons at sundry places have enticed

and procured soldiers to desert and absent themselves from their regiments,

thereby weakening the strength of the armies and prolonging the war, giving

aid and comfort to the enemy, and cruelly exposing the gallant and faithful

soldiers remaining in the ranks to increased hardships and danger, I do there-

fore call upon all patriotic and faithful citizens to oppose and resist the afore-

mentioned dangerous and treasonable crimes, and to aid in restoring to their

regiments all soldiers absent without leave, and to assist in the execution of the

act of congress for enrolling and calling out the national forces, and for other

purposes, and to support the proper authorities in the prosecution and punish-

ment of offenders against said act, and in suppressing the insurrection and

rebellion.

In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand.

Done at the city of Washington, this tenth day of March, in the year of our

Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, and of the Independence of

the United States the eighty-seventh.

April 4,1865. Preamble.
Rewards for the arrest of felons from foreign countries committing felonies in the United States.

To all whom these presents may concern:
Where as , for some time past, evil-disposed persons have crossed the borders of the United States, or entered their ports by sea from countries where they are tolerated, and have committed capital felonies against the property and life of American citizens, as well in the cities as in the rural districts of the country :
Now, therefore, in the name and by the authority of the President of the United States, I do hereby make known that a reward of one thousand dollars will be paid, at this Department, for the capture of each of such offenders upon his conviction by a civil or military tribunal, to whomsoever shall arrest and deliver such offenders into the custody of the civil or military authorities of the United States. And the like reward will be paid, upon the same terms, for the capture of any such persons so entering the United States, whose offences shall be committed subsequently to the publication of this notice.
A reward of five hundred dollars will be paid, upon conviction, for the arrest of any person who shall have aided and abetted offenders of the class before named within the territory of the United States.
Given under my hand, and the seal of the Department of State, at [L. S.] Washington, this fourth day of April, A. D. 1865.

Such proportion of the expenditure provided for by this article as may be considered expedient to distribute in the form of annuities shall be delivered to said Indians as follows, viz: one third thereof during the spring, and two thirds thereof during the autumn of each year.
For the purpose of determining from time to time the aggregate amount to be expended under the provisions of this article, it is agreed that the number entitled to its beneficial provisions the coming year is two thousand eight hundred, and that an accurate census of the Indians entitled shall be taken at the time of the annuity payment in the spring of each year by their agent or other person designated for that purpose by the Secretary of the Interior, which census shall be the basis on which the amount to be expended the next ensuing year shall be determined.
Art ic le VIII. The Indians parties to this treaty expressly covenant and agree that they will use their utmost endeavors to induce that portion of the respective tribes not now present to unite with them and accede to the provisions of this treaty, which union and accession shall be evidenced and made binding on all parties whenever such absentees shall have participated in the beneficial provisions of this treaty.
Art ic le IX. It is further agreed that all arrears of annuities which have accrued or may accrue under the provisions of former treaties prior to the ratification of this treaty, shall be paid to said Indians as soon as practicable, and that upon such ratification such former treaty shall thenceforth be abrogated and of no binding force or validity.
