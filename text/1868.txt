Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the Leavenworth Coal Company, being the successors and assigns of Samuel Denman, William
H. Russell, and Thomas Ewing, junior, in the lease aforesaid, shall have the right to purchase from the United States twenty acres of land lying in the military reserve at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and described as follows : Beginning at the intersection of the south line of the military reserve and the Missouri River, running northwardly thence along the west line of the said Missouri River, thence westwardly in a line parallel to the south line of the military reserve, thence southwardly in a line at right angles with the south line of the military reserve, thence eastwardly in the said south line of the military reserve to the point of beginning, the said lines to be run so as to make the form of the said twenty acres as nearly square as practicable. The said Leavenworth Coal Company shall pay therefor the sum fixed by the United States district judges of the State of Kansas, the eastern district of Missouri, and of the northern district of Illinois, whose reasonable expenses shall be paid out of any money in the treasury not otherwise appropriated; and said lease is hereby extended sixteen years from the passage of this act.
Sec . 2. And be it further enacted, That, upon the payment of the purchase-money for the same, the Secretary of the Interior is hereby directed to issue to the said Leavenworth Coal Company, and its successors and assigns, a patent for the above-described lands, which

Preamble.
Leavenworth Coal Company may purchase part of military reserve.

Whe re as the Secretary of War, in behalf of the United States and in accordance with the previous practice of the War Department, on the thirteenth day of November, in the year eighteen hundred and sixty, did execute to Samuel Denman, William H. Russell, and Thomas Ewing, junior, and their assigns, a lease of twenty acres of land in the military reserve at Fort Leavenworth, State of Kansas, for the term of sixteen years thereafter, with a preference to them of an extension of the term, and with the exclusive right to mine for coal under the lands of said military reserve; and whereas the said lessees and their assigns accepted the said lease, and upon the faith thereof have prosecuted their mining operations under many difficulties at great expense, and have finally succeeded in striking the deep coal beds of that geological region after having expended their entire capital to the amount of forty thousand dollars ; and whereas it is now discovered that the said lease is invalid because the Secretary of War was unauthorized in law to make the same, by reason of which the said lessees are deprived of their right to proceed, and are threatened with the total loss of their money, and are without redress; and whereas in view of the incalculable benefit to be derived, not alone by the State of Kansas, but by the whole country adjacent thereto, by the development of the coal strata of the region, the Senate and House of Representatives of the State of Kansas, on the eighteenth day of February, eighteen hundred and sixty-eight, did concur in a joint resolution reciting the above, and respectfully requesting this Congress to act in the premises ; and whereas the House of Representatives of the United States have heretofore passed an act directing the sale, in small tracts, of a body of land in said military reserve: Therefore,
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the Leavenworth Coal Company, being the successors and assigns of Samuel Denman, William
H. Russell, and Thomas Ewing, junior, in the lease aforesaid, shall have the right to purchase from the United States twenty acres of land lying in the military reserve at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and described as follows : Beginning at the intersection of the south line of the military reserve and the Missouri River, running northwardly thence along the west line of the said Missouri River, thence westwardly in a line parallel to the south line of the military reserve, thence southwardly in a line at right angles with the south line of the military reserve, thence eastwardly in the said south line of the military reserve to the point of beginning, the said lines to be run so as to make the form of the said twenty acres as nearly square as practicable. The said Leavenworth Coal Company shall pay therefor the sum fixed by the United States district judges of the State of Kansas, the eastern district of Missouri, and of the northern district of Illinois, whose reasonable expenses shall be paid out of any money in the treasury not otherwise appropriated; and said lease is hereby extended sixteen years from the passage of this act.
Sec . 2. And be it further enacted, That, upon the payment of the purchase-money for the same, the Secretary of the Interior is hereby directed to issue to the said Leavenworth Coal Company, and its successors and assigns, a patent for the above-described lands, which

A PROCLAMATION.

Whe re as a treaty concerning the citizenship of emigrants between the United States of America and his Majesty the King of Bavaria, was concluded and signed by their respective plenipotentiaries at Munich, on the twenty-sixth day of May, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-eight, which treaty, being in the English and German languages, is word for word as follows : --

Preamble.

His Majesty the King of Bavaria and the President of the United States of America, led by the wish to regulate the citizenship of those persons who emigrate from Bavaria to the United States of America, and from the United States of America to the territory of the kingdom of Bavaria, have resolved to treat on this subject, and have, for that purpose, appointed plenipotentiaries to conclude a convention ; that is to say: His Majesty the King of Bavaria, Dr. Otto, Baron of Voelderndorff, Councillor of Ministry, and the President of the United States of America, George Bancroft, envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary, who have agreed to and signed the following
articles:

Seine Majestat der Kbnig von Bayern und der President der Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika, von dem Wunsche geleitet, die Staatsangehbrigkeit derjenigen Personen zu regeln, welche aus Bayern in die Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika und aus den Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika in das Gebiet des Kbnigreiches Bayern einwandern, haben beschlossen uber diesen Gegenstand zu unterhandeln, und zu diesem Behufe Bevollmachtigte ernannt, um eine Uebereinkunft abzuschliessen, namlich : Seine Majestat der Kbnig von Bayern, Allerhbchstihren Ministerialrath Dr. Otto, Freiherrn von Volderndorff, und der President der Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika, den ausserordentlichen Gesandten und bevollmachtigten Minister
George Bancroft, welche die folgenden Artikel vereinbart und unterzeichnet haben:

Art ike l II.

Naturalized citizens of either country punishable for cer-
tain offences.

A naturalized citizen of the one party on return to the territory of the other party remains liable to trial and punishment for an action punishable by the laws of his original country, and committed before his emigration, saving always the limitation established by the laws of his original country, or any other remission of liability to punishment.

Ein naturalisirter Angehbriger des einen Theils soll bei etwaiger Ruckkehr in das Gebiet des anderen Theils wegen einer, nach den Geset zen des letzteren mit Strafe bedrohten Handlung, welche er vor seiner Auswanderung verubt hat, zur Untersuchung und Strafe gezogen werden kbnnen, sofern nicht nach den bezuglichen Gesetzen seines urspriinglichen Vaterlandes Verjahrung oder sonstige Straflosigkeit eingetreten ist.

tion of criminals to be in force.

The convention for the mutual
delivery of criminals, fugitives from justice, in certain cases, concluded between the United States, on the one part, and Bavaria, on the other part, the twelfth day of September,
one thousand eight hundred and fifty-three, remains in force without
change.

Der Vertrag zwischen dem Kb-

What to be
held as renouncing naturaliza-
tion.

If a Bavarian, naturalized in America, renews his residence in Bavaria, without the intent to return to America, he shall be held to have renounced his naturalization
in the United States. Reciprocally, if an American, naturalized in Bavaria, renews his residence in the United States, without the intent to return to Bavaria, he shall be held to have renounced his naturalization in Bavaria. The intent not to return may be held to exist when the person naturalized in the one country resides more than two years in the other country.

Wenn ein in Amerika naturalisirter Bayer sich wieder in Bayern niederlasst, ohne die Absicht nach Amerika zuriickzukehren, so soli er als auf seine Naturalisation in den Vereinigten Staaten Verzicht leistend erachtet werden.
Ebenso soil ein in Bayern naturalisirter Amerikaner, wenn er sich wieder in den Vereinigten Staaten niederlasst, ohne die Absicht nach Bayern zuriickzukehren, als auf seine Naturalisation in Bayern Verzicht leistend erachtet werden.
Der Verzicht auf die Riickkehr kann als vorhanden angesehen werden, wenn der Naturalisirte des einen Theils sich liinger als zwei Jahre in dem Gebiete des anderen Theils aufhalt.

Done at Munich, the 26th May, 1868.
The undersigned met to-day to sign the treaty agreed upon in conformity with their respective full powers, relating to the citizenship of those persons who emigrate from Bavaria to the United States of America, and from the United States of America to Bavaria; on which occasion the following observations, more exactly defining and explaining the contents of this treaty, were entered in the following protocol:

" and " is made use of, it follows, of course, that not the naturalization alone, but an additional five years' uninterrupted residence is required, before a person can be regarded as coming within the treaty ; but it is by no means requisite that the five years' residence should take place after the naturalization. It is hereby further understood that if a Bavarian has been discharged from his Bavarian indigenate, or on the other side, if an American has been discharged from his American citizenship in the manner legally prescribed by the government of his original country, and then acquires naturalization in the other country in a rightful and perfectly valid manner, then an additional five years' residence shall no longer be required, but a person so naturalized shall from the moment of his naturalization be held and treated as a Bavarian, and reciprocally as an
American citizen. 2. The words " resided uninter-
ruptedly" are obviously to be understood, not of a continued bodily presence, but in the legal sense, and therefore a transient absence, a journey, or the like, by no means interrupts the period of five years contemplated by the first article.

selbst, dass nicht die Naturalization allein, sondern ein dazu kommender funfjahriger ununterbrochener Auf-
enthalt erforderlich ist, um eine Person als unter den Vertrag fallend ansehen zu konnen, wobei iibrigens keineswegs erforderlich sein soil, dass der funfjahrige Aufenthalt erst nach der Naturalization folgen miisste. Dochwird hierbei anerkannt, dass, wenn ein Bayer des bayerischen Indigenates, oder andererseits ein Amerikaner der amerikanischen Staatsangehorigkeit, in der gesetzlich vorgeschriebenen Weise von der Regierung seines bisherigen Vaterlandes entlassen worden ist, und sodann die Naturalization in dem anderen Staate in rechtlicher Weise und vollkommen giltig erlangt hat, dann ein noch hinzukommender funfjahriger Aufenthalt nicht mehr erforderlich sein soll, sondern ein solcher Naturalisirter vom Momente seiner Naturalization an, als bayerischer, und umgekehrt, amerikanischer Angehbriger erachtet und behandelt werden soll.
2. Die Worte " ununterbrochen zugebracht" sind selbstverstandlich nicht im kbrperlichen sondern im juristischen Sinne zu nehmen, und desshalb unterbricht eine momentane Abwesenheit, eine Reise, oder dergleichen, keineswegs die funf-
jahrige Frist, welche der Artikel I. im Sinne hat.

No punish-
ment for emigration.

II. Rel at in g to th e Seco nd Art ic le of th e Tre aty .
1. It is expressly agreed, that a person who, under the first article, is to be held as an adopted citizen of the other state, on his return to his original country cannot be made punishable for the act of emigration itself, not even though at a later day he should have lost his adopted citizenship.

their laws for protection against resident aliens, whose residence endangers peace and order in the land, are not affected by the treaty. In particular the regulation contained in the second clause of the tenth article of the Bavarian military law of the 30th of January, 1868, according to which Bavarians emigrating from Bavaria before the fulfilment of their military duty cannot be admitted to a permanent residence in the land till they shall have become thirty-two years old, is not affected by the treaty. But yet it is established and agreed, that by the expression " permanent residence " used in the said article, the above described emigrants are not forbidden to undertake a journey to Bavaria for a less period of time and for definite purposes, and the royal Bavarian government moreover cheerfully declares itself ready, in all cases in which the emigration has plainly taken place in good faith, to allow a mild rule in practice to be adopted.
2. It is hereby agreed that when a Bavarian naturalized in America and reciprocally an American naturalized in Bavaria takes up his abode once more in his original country without the intention of return to the country of his adoption, he does by no means thereby recover his former citizenship ; on the contrary, in so far as it relates to Bavaria, it depends on his Majesty, the King, whether he will, or will not in that event grant the Bavarian citizenship anew.
The article fourth shall accordingly have only this meaning, that the adopted country of the emigrant cannot prevent him from acquiring once more his former citizenship;
but not that the state to which the emigrant originally belonged is bound to restore him at once to his original relation.
On the contrary, the citizen naturalized abroad must first apply to be received back into his original country in the manner prescribed by its laws and regulations, and must acquire citizenship anew, exactly like any other alien.
But yet it is left to his own free

Sicherungsmassregeln gegen solche in ihrem Territorium sich aufhaltende Fremde, deren Aufenthalt die Ruhe und Ordnung im Lande gefahrdet, durch den Vertrag nicht beriihrt werden ; insbesondere wird die im bayerischen Wehrgesetze vom 30ten Januar, 1868, Artikel 10, Absatz 2, enthaltene Bestimmung, wonach denjenigen Bayern, welche vor Erfiillung ihrer Militarpflicht aus Bayern ausgewandert sind, der standige Aufenthalt im Lande bis zum vollendeten 32ten. Lebensjahre untersagt ist, durch den Vertrag nicht beriihrt, doch wird constatirt, dass durch den im Artikel 10 gebrauchten Ausdruck : " der standige Aufenthalt" ohnehin schon derartig Ausgewanderten eine kiirzere und zu bestimmten Zwecken unternommene voriibergehende Reise nach Bayern nicht untersagt ist, und erklarte sich die Kbniglich Bayerische Staatsregierung iiberdiess gern bereit, in solchen Fallen, in welchen die Auswanderung offenbar bona fide geschehen ist, eine milde Praxis eintreten zu lassen.
2. Es wird anerkannt, dass ein in Amerika naturalisirter Bayer und uragekehrt ein in Bayern naturalisirter Amerikaner, wenn er sich ohne die Absicht, in sein new erworbenes Vaterland zuriickzukehren in seinem fruheren Vaterlande wieder niedergelassen hat, keineswegs hierdurch allein schon die friihere Staatsangehbrigkeit wieder erlangt, vielmehr hangt es, was Bayern anbetrifft, von Seiner Majestat dem Konige ab, ob er in diesem Falle die Bayerische Staatsangehorigkeit wieder verleihen will oder nicht.
Der Artikel IV. soll demnach nur die Bedeutung haben, dass derjenige Staat, in welchem der Ausgewanderte die neue Staatsangehbrigkeit erworben hat, diesen nicht hindern kann, die friihere Staatsangehbrigkeit wieder zuriickzuerwerben; nicht aber, dass der Staat, welchem der Ausgewanderte friiher angehbrt hat, denselben auch sofort wieder zuriicknehmen miisse. Es hat viehnehr der im anderen Staate Naturalisirte nach den bestehenden Gesetzen und Vorschriften sich um Wiederaufnahme in sein friiheres

TO ALL AND SINGULAR TO WHOM THESE PRESENTS SHALL COME, GREETING :

Whe rea s to the treaty of the ninth of June, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, between the United States and the Nez Perce tribe of Indians, an amendatory treaty was concluded at the city of Washington, in the District of Columbia, on the thirteenth day of August, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-eight, by and between Nathaniel G. Taylor, commissioner, on the part of the United States, and Lawyer, head chief, and Timothy and Jason, chiefs, of the Nez Perce tribe of Indians, on the part of said tribe of Indians, and duly authorized thereto by them, which amendatory treaty is in the words and figures following, to wit:
Whereas certain amendments are desired by the Nez Perce tribe of Indians to their treaty concluded at the Council Ground in the valley of the Lapwai, in the Territory of Washington, on the ninth day of June, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three; and whereas the United States are willing to assent to said amendments; it is therefore agreed by and between Nathaniel G. Taylor, commissioner, on the part of the United States, thereunto duly authorized, and Lawyer, Timothy, and Jason, chiefs of said tribe, also being thereunto duly authorized, in manner and form following, that is to say:
Art ic le I.

none of the same shall be cut or removed without the consent of the

head chief of the tribe, together with the consent of the agent and Superintendent of Indian Affairs, first being given in writing, which writ-

States, the interest on the same to be paid to said tribe annually for the

No. 6. July 4, 1868. BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:

A PROCLAMATION.

Preamble. Vol. xiii. pp. 737, 741, 758. Ante, p. 699.
Full pardon

Whe rea s in the month of July, anno Domini 1861, in accepting the con-
dition of civil war, which was brought about by insurrection and rebellion in several of the States which constitute the United States, the two Houses of Congress did solemnly declare that that war was not waged on the part of the Government in any spirit of oppression, nor for any purpose of conquest or subjugation, nor for any purpose of overthrowing or interfering with the rights or established institutions of the States, but only to defend and maintain the supremacy of the Constitution of the United States, and to preserve the Union with all the dignity, equality, and rights of the several States unimpaired, and that so soon as those objects should be accomplished, the war on the part of the Government should cease;
And whereas the President of the United States has heretofore, in the spirit of that declaration, and with the view of securing for it ultimate and complete effect, set forth several proclamations, offering amnesty and pardon to persons who had been or were concerned in the aforenamed rebellion, which proclamations, however, were attended with prudential reservations and exceptions, then deemed necessary and proper, and which proclamations were respectively issued on the eighth day of December, one thousand eight hundred and sixtythree, on the twenty-sixth day of March, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-four, on the twenty-ninth day of May, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-five, and on the seventh day of September, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-seven;
And whereas the said lamentable civil war has long since altogether ceased, with an acknowledgment by all the States of the supremacy of the Federal Constitution and of the Government thereunder, and there no longer exists any reasonable ground to apprehend a renewal of the said civil war, or any foreign interference, or any unlawful resistance by any portion of the people of any of the States to the Constitution and laws of the United States;
And whereas it is desirable to reduce the standing army, and to bring to a speedy termination military occupation, martial law, military tribunals, abridgment of the freedom of speech and of the press, and suspension of the privilege of habeas corpus, and of the right of trial by jury, -- such encroachments upon our free institutions in time of peace being dangerous to public liberty, incom-
patible with the individual rights of the citizen, contrary to the genius and spirit of our republican form of Government, and exhaustive of the national resources;
And whereas it is believed that amnesty and pardon will tend to secure a complete and universal establishment and prevalence of municipal law and order, in conformity with the Constitution of the United States, and to remove all appearances or presumptions of a retaliatory or vindictive policy on the part of the Government, attended by unnecessary disqualifications, pains, penalties,
confiscations, and disfranchisements, and, on the contrary, to promote and procure complete fraternal reconciliation among the whole people, with due submission to the Constitution and laws:
Now, therefore, be it known that I, And rew Joh nso n , President of the

United States, do, by virtue of the Constitution and in the name of the people of the United States, hereby proclaim and declare, unconditionally and without reservation, to all and to every person who directly or indirectly participated in the late insurrection or rebellion, excepting such person or persons as may be under presentment or indictment in any court of the United States having competent jurisdiction, upon a charge of treason or other felony, a full pardon and amnesty for the offence of treason against the United States, or of adhering to their enemies during the late civil war, with restoration of all rights of property, except as to slaves, and except also as to any property of which any person may have been legally divested under the laws of the United States.
In testimony whereof I have signed these presents with my hand, and have caused the seal of the United States to be hereunto affixed.
Done at the city of Washington, the fourth day of July, in the year of our [SEAL.] Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the ninety-third. ANDREW JOHNSON.

SECRETARY OF STATE OF THZ UNITED STATES,
TO ALL TO WHOM THESE PRESENTS MAY COME, GREETING:

Preamble-

Whe rea s the Congress of the United States, on or about the sixteenth of June, in the year one thousand eight hundred and sixty-six, passed a resolution which is in the words and figures following, to wit: --

Vol. xiv. p. 358.

"JOINT RESOLUTION PROPOSING AN AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES,

" Be it resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, (two thirds of both Houses concurring), That the following article be proposed to the legislatures of the several States as an amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which when ratified by three fourths of said legislatures, shall be valid as part of the Constitution,

namely: --

"ARTICLE XIV.

" Sec ti on 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law, nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.
" Sec tio n 2. Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed. But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice-President of the United States, Representatives in Congress, the executive and judicial officers of a State, or the members of the legislature thereof, is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one years of age, and citizens of the United States, or in any way abridged, except for participation in rebellion or other crime, the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State.
" Sec ti on 3. No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may, by a vote of two thirds of each House, remove such disability.
" Secti on 4. The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned. But neither the United States nor any State shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States, or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave; but all such debts, obligations, and claims shall be held illegal and void.
" Sec ti on 5. The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.
"SCHUYLER COLFAX, " Speaker of the House of Representatives.
"LA FAYETTE S. FOSTER, " President of the Senate pro tempore.
" Attest: " Edwd . Mc Phe rso n , " Clerk of the House of Representatives. "J. W. For ne y , " Secretary of the Senate."

APPENDIX.

707

And whereas by the second section of the act of Congress, approved the twen-

tieth of April, one thousand eight hundred and eighteen, entitled " An act to pro-

vide for the publication of the laws of the United States, and for other purposes,"

it is made the duty of the Secretary of State forthwith to cause any amend-

ment to the Constitution of the United States, which has been adopted accord-

ing to the provisions of the said Constitution, to be published in the newspapers

authorized to promulgate the laws, with his certificate specifying the States by

which the same may have been adopted, and that the same has become valid, to

all intents and purposes, as a part of the Constitution of the United States;

And whereas neither the act just quoted from, nor any other law, expressly

or by conclusive implication, authorizes the Secretary of State to determine

and "decide doubtful questions as to the authenticity of the organization of

Srate legislatures, or as to the power of any State legislature to recall a

previous act or resolution of ratification of any amendment proposed to the

Constitution ;

And whereas it appears from official documents on file in this Department

that the amendment to the Constitution of the United States, proposed as aforesaid, has been ratified by the legislatures of the States of Connecticut,

New Hampshire, Tennessee, New Jersey, Oregon, Vermont, New York, Ohio,

Illinois, West Virginia, Kansas,' Maine, Nevada, Missouri, Indiana, Minnesota,

Rhode Island, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Massachusetts, Nebraska,

and Iowa; And whereas it further appears from documents on file in this Department

that the amendment to the Constitution of the United States, proposed as afore-

said, has also been ratified by newly constituted and newly established bodies

avowing themselves to be and acting as the legislatures, respectively, of the States of Arkansas, Florida, North Carolina, Louisiana, South Carolina, and

Alabama ;

And whereas it further appears from official documents on file in this De-

partment that the legislatures of two of the States first above enumerated, to

wit, Ohio and New Jersey, have since passed resolutions respectively withdraw-

ing the consent of each of said States to the aforesaid amendment; and whereas

it is deemed a matter of doubt and uncertainty whether such resolutions are

not irregular, invalid, and therefore ineffectual for withdrawing the consent of

the said two States, or of either of them, to the aforesaid amendment;

And whereas the whole number of States in the United States is thirty-seven,

to wit: New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York,

New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina,

South Carolina, Georgia, Vermont, Kentucky, Tennessee, Ohio, Louisiana, In-

diana, Mississippi, Illinois, Alabama, Maine, Missouri, Arkansas, Michigan, Flor-

ida, Texas, Iowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota, California, Oregon, Kansas, West

Virginia, Nevada, and Nebraska;

And whereas the twenty-three States first hereinbefore named, whose legis-

latures have ratified the said proposed amendment, and the six States next

thereafter named, as having ratified the said proposed amendment by newly

constituted and established legislative bodies, together constitute three fourths

of the whole number of States in the United States:
Now, therefore, be it known that I, Wil li am H. Sew ar d , Secretary of

State of the United States, by virtue and in pursuance of the second section of

the act of Congress, approved the twentieth of April, eighteen hundred and

eighteen, hereinbefore cited, do hereby certify that if the resolutions of the legis-

latures of Ohio and New Jersey ratifying the aforesaid amendment are to be

deemed as remaining of full force and effect, notwithstanding the subsequent

resolutions of the legislatures of those States, which purport to withdraw the

consent of said States from such ratification, then the aforesaid amendment has

been ratified in the manner hereinbefore mentioned, and so has become valid,

to all intents and purposes, as a part of the Constitution of the United States.

In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of

the Department of State to be affixed.

A PROCLAMATION.

In the year which is now drawing to its end, the art, the skill, and the labor
of the people of the United States have been employed with greater diligence and vigor, and on broader fields than ever before, and the fruits of the earth have been gathered into the granary and the storehouse in marvellous abundance. Our highways have been lengthened, and new and prolific regions have been occupied. We are permitted to hope that long protracted political and sectional dissensions are at no distant day to give place to returning harmony and fraternal affection throughout the Republic. Many foreign states have entered into liberal agreements with us, while nations which are far off, and which heretofore have been unsocial and exclusive, have become our friends.
The annual period of rest, which we have reached in health and tranquillity, and which is crowned with so many blessings, is by universal consent a convenient and suitable one for cultivating personal piety and practising public devotion.
I therefore recommend that Thursday, the twenty-sixth day of November next, be set apart, and observed by all the people of the United states, as a day for public praise, thanksgiving, and prayer to the Almighty Creator and Divine Ruler of the Universe, by whose ever-watchful, merciful, and gracious providence alone, states and nations, no less than families and individual men, do
live and move and have their being. In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of the
United States to be affixed. Done at the city of Washington, this twelfth day of October, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-eight, and of the In[L. s.] dependence of the United States the ninety-third. ANDREW JOHNSON.

A PROCLAMATION.

In the year which is now drawing to its end, the art, the skill, and the labor
of the people of the United States have been employed with greater diligence and vigor, and on broader fields than ever before, and the fruits of the earth have been gathered into the granary and the storehouse in marvellous abundance. Our highways have been lengthened, and new and prolific regions have been occupied. We are permitted to hope that long protracted political and sectional dissensions are at no distant day to give place to returning harmony and fraternal affection throughout the Republic. Many foreign states have entered into liberal agreements with us, while nations which are far off, and which heretofore have been unsocial and exclusive, have become our friends.
The annual period of rest, which we have reached in health and tranquillity, and which is crowned with so many blessings, is by universal consent a convenient and suitable one for cultivating personal piety and practising public devotion.
I therefore recommend that Thursday, the twenty-sixth day of November next, be set apart, and observed by all the people of the United states, as a day for public praise, thanksgiving, and prayer to the Almighty Creator and Divine Ruler of the Universe, by whose ever-watchful, merciful, and gracious providence alone, states and nations, no less than families and individual men, do
live and move and have their being. In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of the
United States to be affixed. Done at the city of Washington, this twelfth day of October, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-eight, and of the In[L. s.] dependence of the United States the ninety-third. ANDREW JOHNSON.

of the United States, which proclamations were severally issued on the eighth

day of December, 1863, on the twenty-sixth day of March, 1864, on the twenty-

ninth day of May, 1865, on the seventh day of September, 1867, and on the

fourth day of July, in the present year;

And whereas, the authority of the Federal Government having been re-es-

tablished in all the States and Territories within the jurisdiction of the United

States, it is believed that such prudential reservations and exceptions as at the

dates of said several proclamations were deemed necessary and proper may now

be wisely and justly relinquished, and that a universal amnesty and pardon for

participation in said rebellion extended to all who have borne any part therein

will tend to secure permanent peace, order, and prosperity throughout the land,

and to renew and fully restore confidence and fraternal feeling among the whole

people, and their respect for and attachment to the National Government, de-

signed by its patriotic founders for the general good:

Now, therefore, be it known that I, And re w John son , President of the

United States, by virtue of the power and authority in me vested by the Con-

stitution, and in the name of the sovereign people of the United States, do

hereby proclaim and declare unconditionally, and without reservation, to all

and to every person who directly or indirectly participated in the late insur-

rection or rebellion, a full pardon and amnesty for the offence of treason against

the United States, or of adhering to their enemies during the late civil war,

with restoration of all rights, privileges, and immunities under the Constitution

and the laws which have been made in pursuance thereof.

In testimony whereof, I have signed these presents with my hand, and have

caused the seal of the United States to be hereunto affixed.

the following article be proposed to the legislatures of the several States as an amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which, when ratified by three fourths of said legislatures, shall be valid as part of the Constitution, namely: --
"ARTICLE XIV.
" Sec ti on 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and
subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law, nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.
" Sec ti on 2. Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States
according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed. But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice-President of the United States, Representatives in Congress, the executive and judicial officers of a State, or the members of the legislature thereof, is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one years of age, and citizens of the United States, or in any way abridged, except for participation in rebellion or other crime, the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State.

or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may, by a vote of two thirds of each House, remove such disability.
" Sect io n 4. The validity of the public debt of the United States, author-
ized by law, including debts incurred tor payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned. But neither the United States nor any State shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States, or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave; but all such debts, obligations, and claims shall be held illegal and void.
" Sec ti on 5. The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate
legislation, the provisions of this article. "SCHUYLER COLFAX,

In the year which is now drawing to its end, the art, the skill, and the labor
of the people of the United States have been employed with greater diligence and vigor, and on broader fields than ever before, and the fruits of the earth have been gathered into the granary and the storehouse in marvellous abundance. Our highways have been lengthened, and new and prolific regions have been occupied. We are permitted to hope that long protracted political and sectional dissensions are at no distant day to give place to returning harmony and fraternal affection throughout the Republic.

BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: August 1, 1868.

A PROCLAMATION.

Whe re as a convention concerning the citizenship of emigrants between the United States of America and the Grand Duchy of Hesse, was concluded and signed by their respective plenipotentiaries at Darmstadt, on the first day of August, one thousand eight hundred and sixtyeight, which convention, being in the English and German languages, is word for word as follows : --

Preamble.

Whereas an agreement was made on the 22d of February, 1868, between the United States of America and the North German Confederation, to regulate the citizenship of those persons who emigrate from the United States of America to the territory of the North German Confederation and from the North German Confederation to the United States of America, and whereas this agreement by publication in the bulletin of the laws of that Confederation has obtained binding force in the parts of the Grand Duchy of Hesse belonging to the North German Confederation, it has seemed proper in like manner to establish regulations respecting the citizenship of such persons as emigrate from the United States of America to the parts of the Grand Duchy of Hesse not belonging to the North German Confederation, and from the above-described parts of Hesse to the United States of America.
The President of the United States of America and his Royal Highness the Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine have therefore resolved to treat on this subject, and for that purpose have appointed plenipotentiaries to conclude a convention, that is to say, the President of the United States of America, George Bancroft, envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary, and his Royal Highness the Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine, &c., Dr. Frederick Baron von Lindelof, president of his council of state,

Wher eas a convention between the United States of America and the republic of Peru, providing for the adjustment of claims of citizens of either country against the other, was concluded and signed by their respective plenipotentiaries at the city of Lima, on the fourth day of December, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-eight, which convention, being in the English and Spanish languages, is word for' word as follows : --

Preamble.

Whereas claims may have, at various times since the signature of the decisions of the mixed commission which met in Lima in July, 1863, been made on the government of the United States of America, by citizens of Peru, and have been made by citizens of the United States of America on the government of Peru, and whereas some of such claims are still pending, the President of the United States of America and the President of Peru, being of opinion that a speedy and equitable settlement of all such claims will contribute much to the maintenance of the friendly feelings which 'subsist between the two countries, have resolved to make arrangements for that purpose by means of a convention, and have named as their plenipotentiaries to confer and agree thereupon, that is
to say: The President of the United
States names Alvin P.

To that end, the consuls of the United States in Belgium may apply to any of the competent authorities; and the consuls of Belgium in the United States may apply in writing to either the federal, State, or municipal courts or authorities, and make a request in writing for the deserters, supporting it by the exhibition of the register of the vessel and list of the crew, or by other official documents, to show that the persons claimed belong to the said crew.
