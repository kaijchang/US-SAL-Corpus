"(c) Each Comptroller General, or retired Comptroller General,

making an election to receive survivorship benefits, shall deposit with

the General Accounting Office for covering into the general fund of

the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts a sum equal to 3 per centum

of his salary and retirement pay received by him as Comptroller Gen-

" Q ) if such Comptroller General or retired Comptroller General is survived by a widow but not by a dependent child, there shall be paid to such widow an annuity be^mning with the day of his death or following the widow's attainment of the age of fifty years, whichever is the later, in an amount computed as provided in subsection (n) of this section; or

"(3) if such Comptroller General or retired Comptroller General leaves no surviving widow but leaves a surviving dependent child or children, there shall be paid to or on behalf of each such child an immediate annuity equal to the amount of the annuity to which such widow would have been entitled under paragraph (2) of this subsection had she survived, but not to exceed $480 per year. "(f) The annuity payable to the widow hereunder shall be terminable upon her death or remarriage.

JOINT RESOLUTION Providing for the designation of the third week of July as "Captive Nations
Week".

we^k"*^^* Nations

Whereas the greatness of the United States is in large part attributable to its having been able, through the democratic process, to achieve a harmonious national unity of its people, even though they stem from the most diverse of racial, religious, and ethnic backgrounds; and
Whereas this harmonious unification of the diverse elements of our free society has led the people of the United States to possess a warm understanding and sympathy for the aspirations of peoples everyw^here and to recognize the natural interdependency of the peoples and nations of the world; and
Whereas the enslavement of a substantial part of the world's population by Communist imperialism makes a mockery of the idea of peaceful coexistence between nations and constitutes a detriment to the natural bonds of understanding between the people of the United States and other peoples; and
Whereas since 1918 the imperialistic and aggressive policies of Russian communism have resulted in the creation of a vast empire which poses a dire threat to the security of the United States and of all the free peoples of the w^orld; and
Whereas the imperialistic policies of Communist Russia have led,, through direct and indirect aggression, to the subjugation of the national independence of Poland, Hungary, Lithuania, Ukraine, Czechoslovakia, Latvia, Estonia, White Ruthenia, Rumania, East Germany, Bulgaria, mainland China, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, North Korea, Albania, Idel-Ural, Tibet, Cossackia, Turkestan, North Viet-Nam, and others; and
Whereas these submerged nations look to the United States, as the citadel of human freedom, for leadership in bringing about their liberation and independence and in restoring to them the enjoyment of their Christian, Jewish, Moslem, Buddhist, or other religious freedoms, and of their individual liberties; and
Whereas it is vital to the national security of the United States that the desire for liberty and independence on the part of the peoples of these conquered nations should be steadfastly kept alive; and
Whereas the desire for liberty and independence by the overwhelming majority of the people of these submerged nations constitutes a powerful deterrent to w^ar and one of the best hopes for a just and lasting peace; and
Whereas it is fitting that we clearly manifest to such peoples through an appropriate and official means the historic fact that the people of the United States share with them their aspirations for the recovery of their freedom and independence: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved by the Senate arid House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the President of the United States is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation designating the third week in July 1959 as "Captive Nations Week" and inviting the people of the United States to observe such week with appropriate ceremonies and activities. The President is further authorized and requested to issue a similar proclamation each year until such time as freedom and independence shall have been achieved for all the captive nations of the world.

70 Stat. 555. 22 u s e 1750.

STATEMENT OF POLICY
SEC. 2. Section 2 of the Mutual Security Act of 1954, as amended, which is a statement of policj^, is amended to read as follows:
"SEC. 2. STATEMENT OF POLICY.-- (a) I t is the sense of the Congress that peace in the world increasingly depends on wider recognition, both m principle and practice, of the dignity and interdependence of men; and that the survival of free institutions in the United States can best be assured in a world wide atmosphere of expanded freedom.
" (b) Through programs of assistance authorized by this Act and its predecessors, the United States has helped thwart Communist intimidation in many countries of the world, has helped Europe recover from the wounds of World W a r I I , has supported defensive military preparations of nations alerted by Communist aggression, and has soundly begun to help peoples of economically underdeveloped areas to develop their resources and improve their living standards.
" (c) Programs authorized by this Act continue to serve the following principal purposes:
"(1) The Congress recognizes the basic identity of interest which exists between the people of the United States and the peoples of other lands who are striving to establish and develop politically independent and economically viable units, and to produce more goods and services, and to improve ways of living by methods which reflect the popular will, and to realize aspirations for justice, for education, and for dignity and respect as individual human beings, and to establish responsible governments which will cooperate with other likeminded governments. The Congress declares it to be a primary objective and need of the United States, and one consistent with its tradition and ideals, to share these strivings by providing assistance, with due regard for our other obligations, to peoples willing to work energetically toward these ends.
"(2) The Congress recognizes that the peace of the world and the security of the United States are endangered so long as international communism and the nations it controls continue by threat of military action, by the use of economic pressure, and by internal subversion, or other means to attempt to bring under their domination peoples now free and independent and continue to deny the rights of freedom and self-government to peoples and nations once free but now subject to such domination. The Congress declares it to be the policy of the United States to continue so long as such danger to the peace of the Avorld and to the security of the United States persists, to make available to other free nations and peoples upon request assistance of such

247

nature and in such amounts as the United States deems advisable compatible with its own stability, strength,^ and other obligations, and^as may be needed and effectively used by such free nations and peoples to help them maintain their freedom.
" ( d ) I t is the sense of the Congress that inasmuch as-- "(1) the United States, through mutual security programs, has
made substantial contributions to the economic recovery and rehabilitation of the nations of Western Europe; and
" (2) due in part to those programs, it has been possible for such nations to achieve complete economic recovery and to regain their military strength; *and
"(3) certain other friendly nations of the world remain in need of assistance in order that they may defend themselves against aggression and contribute to the security of the free world; those nations which have been assisted in their recovery should, in the future, share with the United States to a greater extent the financial burden of providing aid to those countries which are still in need of assistance of the type provided under this Act. "(e) I t is the sense of the Congress that assistance provided under this Act shall be administered so as to assist other peoples in their efforts to achieve self-government or independence under circumstances which will enable them to assume an equal station among the free nations of the world and to fulfill their responsibilities for self-government or independence. To this end, assistance shall be rendered where appropriate and feasible in such a way as to promote the emergence of political units which are economically viable, either alone or in cooperation with neighboring units."

Any payments made by an employer-garnishee in conformity with this subsection shall be a discharge of the liability of the employer to the judgment debtor to the extent of such payment. Under this subsection the employergarnishee shall not withhold or pay over more than 10 per centum of the gross wages payable to the judgment debtor for any pay period ending in any calendar month until the total amount of gross wages

"SEC. 15d. (a) The Corporation is authorized to issue and sell bouds, uotes, and other evidences of indebtedness (hereinafter coUectively referred to as 'bonds') in an amount not exceeding $750,000,000
outstanding at any one time to assist in financing its power program and to refund such bonds.

Unless otherwise specifically authorized by Act of Congress the Corporation shall make no contracts for the sale or delivery of power which would have the effect of making the Corporation or its distributors, directly or indirectly, a source of power supply outside the area for which the Corporation or its distributors were the primary source of power supply on July 1,1957,

"Nothing in this subsection shall prevent the Corporation or its distributors from supplying electric power to any customer within any area in which the Corporation or its distributors had generally established electric service on July 1,1957, and to which electric service was not being supplied from any other source on the effective date of this Act.
"Nothing in this subsection shall prevent the Corporation, when economically feasible, from making exchange power arrangements with other power-generating organizations with which the Corporation had such arrangements on July 1, 1957, nor prevent the Corporation from continuing to supply power to Dyersburg, Tennessee, and Covington, Tennessee, or from entering into contracts to supply or from supplying power to the cities of Paducah, Kentucky; Princeton, Kentucky; Glasgow, Kentucky; Fulton, Kentucky; Monticello, Kentucky; Hickman, Kentucky; Chickamauga, Georgia; Kinggold, Georgia; Oak Ridge, Tennessee; and South Fulton, Tennessee; or agencies thereof; or from entering into contracts to supply or from supplying power for the Naval Auxiliary Air Station in Lauderdale and Kemper Counties, Mississippi, through the facilities of the East Mississippi Electric Power Association: Provided further^ That nothing herein contained shall prevent the transmission of TVA power to the Atomic Energy Commission or the Department of Defense or any agency thereof, on certification by the President of the United States that an emergency defense need for such power exists. Nothing in this Act shall affect the present rights of the parties in any existing lawsuits involving efforts of towns in the same general area where TVA power is supplied to obtain TVA power.

I n order to protect the investment of holders of the Corporation's securities and the appropriation investment as defined in subsection (e) hereof, the Corporation, during each successive five-year period beginning with the five-year period which commences on July 1 of the first full fiscal year after the effective date of this section, shall apply net power proceeds either in reduction (directly or through payments into reserve or sinking funds) of its capital obligations, including bonds and the appropriation investment, or to reinvestment in power assets, at least to the extent of the combined amount of the aggregate of the depreciation accruals and other charges representing the amortization of capital expenditures applicable to its power properties plus the net proceeds realized from any disposition of power facilities in said period.

acreage allotment for such farm, the entire acreage allotment for such

farm (excluding any allotment released from the farm or reappor-

tioned to the farm and any allotment provided for the farm pursuant

to subsection (f) (7) (A) of section 344) shall, except as provided Putc*i3^4^^.'

herein, be considered for the purpose of establishing future State,

county and farm acreage allotments to have been plstnted to such

commodity in such year on such farm, but the 1956 acreage allotment

of any commodity shall be regarded as planted under this section only

if the owner or operator on such farm notified the county committee

prior to the sixtieth day preceding the beginning of the marketing

year for such commodity of his desire to preserve such allotment:

Provided, That beginning with the 1960 crop, except for federally

owned land, the current farm acreage allotment established for a

commodity shall not be preserved as history acreage pursuant to the

provisions of this section unless for the current year or either of the

two preceding years an acreage equal to 75 per centum or more of the

farm acreage allotment for such year was actually planted or devoted

to the commodity on the farm (or was regarded as planted under

provisions of the Soil Bank Act or the Great Plains program) : Pro- 70 stat. iss.

and (6) of this subsection, the Secretary shall, if allotments were in

effect the preceding year, provide for the county acreage allotment

under paragraph (3) of this subsection, to be apportioned to farms

on which cotton has been planted in any one of the three years

immediately preceding the year for which such allotment is deter-

mined, on the basis of the farm acreage allotment for the year imme-

diately preceding the year for which such apportionment is made,

adjusted as may be necessary (i) for any change in the acreage of

cropland available for the production of cotton, or (ii) to meet the

requirements of any provision (other than those contained in para-

(or regarded as planted under the Soil Bank Act, the Great Plains program, and the release and reapportionment provisions of subsection (m) (2) of this section) to cotton on the farm in the preceding year was less than 75 per centum of the farm allotment for such year, in lieu of using such allotment as the farm base as provided in this paragraph, the base shall be the average of (1) the cotton acreage tor the farm for the preceding year as determined for purposes of this proviso and (2) the allotment established for the farm pursuant to the provisions of this subsection (f) for such preceding year; and the 1958 allotment used for establishing the minimum farm allotment under paragraph (1) of this subsection (f) shall be adjusted to the average acreage so determined. The base for a farm shall not be adjusted as provided in this paragraph if the county committee determines that failure to plant at least 75 per centum of the farm allotment was due to conditions beyond the control of producers on the farm. The Secretary shall establish limitations to prevent allocations of allotment to farms not affected by the foregoing proviso, which would be excessive on the basis of the cropland, past cotton acreage, allotments for other commodities, and good soil conservation practices on such farms."
(2) Paragraph (3) of subsection (g) is hereby repealed. (3) Subsection (i) is amended by adding the following at the end thereof: "Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, beginning with the 1960 crop the planting of cotton on a farm in any of the immediately preceding three years that allotments were in effect but no allotment was established for such farm for any year of such threeyear period shall not make the farm eligible for an allotment as an old farm under subsection (f) of this section: Provided^ however^ That by reason of such planting the farm need not be considered as ineligible for a new farm allotment under subsection (f) (3) of this section."
(4) Paragraph (2) of subsection (m) is changed to read as follows: "(2) Any part of any farm cotton acreage allotment on which
cotton will not be planted and which is voluntarily surrendered to the county committee shall be deducted from the allotment to such farm and may be reapportioned by the county committee to other farms in the same county receiving allotments in amounts determined by the county committee to be fair and reasonable on the basis of past acreage of cotton, land, labor, equipment available for the production of cotton, crop rotation practices, and soil and other physical facilities affecting the production of cotton. If all of the allotted acreage voluntarily surrendered is not needed in the county, the county committee may surrender the excess acreage to the State committee to be used for the same purposes as the State acreage reserve under subsection (e) of this section. Any allotment released under this provision shall be regarded for the purposes of establishing future allotments as having been planted on the farm and in the county where the release was made rather than on the farm and in the county to which the allotment was transferred, except that this shall not operate to make the farm from which the allotment was transferred eligible for an allotment as having cotton planted thereon during the three-year base period: Provided, That notwithstanding any other provisions of law, any p a r t of any farm acreage allotment may be permanently released in writing to the county committee by the owner and operator of the farm, and reapportioned as provided herein. Acreage released under this paragraph shall be credited to the State in determining future allotments. The provisions of this paragraph shall apply also to extra long staple cotton covered by section 347 of this Act (7 U.S.C. 1344(m)).^

SHORT TITLE
SECTION 1. This Act may be cited as the "Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959".

DECLARATION OF FINDINGS, PURPOSES, A N D POLICY
SEC. 2. (a) The Congress finds that, in the public interest, it continues to be the responsibility of the Federal Government to protect employees' rights to organize, choose their own representatives, bargain collectively, and otherwise engage in concerted activities for their mutual aid or protection; that the relations between employers and labor organizations and the millions of workers they represent have a substantial impact on the commerce of the Nation; and that in order to accomplish the objective of a free flow of commerce it is essential that labor organizations, employers, and their officials adhere to the highest standards of responsibility and ethical conduct in administering the affairs of their organizations, particularly as they affect labor-management relations.
(b) The Congress further finds, from recent investigations in the labor and management fields, that there have been a number of instances of breach of trust, corruption, disregard of the rights of individual employees, and other failures to observe high standards of responsibility and ethical conduct which require further and supplementary legislation that will afford necessary protection of the rights and interests of employees and the public generally as they relate to the activities of labor organizations, employers, labor relations consultants, and their officers and representatives.
(c) The Congress, therefore, further finds and declares that the enactment of this Act is necessary to eliminate or prevent improper practices on the part of labor organizations, employers, labor relations consultants, and their officers and representatives which distort and defeat the policies of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, as amended, and the Railway Labor Act, as amended, and have the tendency or necessary effect of burdening or obstructing commerce by (1) impairing the efficiency, safety, or operation of the instrumentalities of commerce; (2) occurring in the current of commerce; (3) materially affecting, restraining, or controlling the flow of raw materials or manufactured or processed goods into or from the channels of commerce, or the prices of such materials or goods in commerce; or (4) causing diminution of employment and wages in such volume as substantially to impair or disrupt the market for goods flowing into or from the channels of commerce.

(b) When any officer, agent, shop steward, or representative of any labor organization is alleged to have violated the duties declared in subsection (a) and the labor organization or its governing board or officers refuse or fail to sue or recover damages or secure an accounting or other appropriate relief within a reasonable time after being requested to do so by any member of the labor organization, such member may sue such officer, agent, shop steward, or representative in any district court of the United States or in any State court of competent jurisdiction to recover damages or secure an accounting or other appropriate relief for the benefit of the labor organization. No such proceeding shall be brought except upon leave of the court obtained upon verified application and for good cause shown, which application may be made ex parte. The trial judge may allot a reasonable part of the recovery in any action under this subsection to pay the fees of counsel prosecuting the suit at the instance of the memoer of the labor organization and to compensate such member for any expenses necessarily paid or incurred by him in connection with the litigation.

New York and the State of New .Jersey for the creation of the New YorkNew Jersey Transportation Agency.

September ;il, 1959 [H. j . Res. 403]

Whereas the State of New York and the State of New Jersey have entered into a certain compact known as the New York-New Jersey Transportation Agency Compact, by means of concurrent legislation to that end, being chapter 420 of the Laws of New York of 1959, and chapter 13 of the Laws of New Jersey of 1959 as amended by chapter 24 of the Laws of New Jersey of 1959, for the development and execution of interim plans and the preparation of a long-range plan to deal with problems of mass transit systems for the transportation by common carrier of passengers to or across the Hudson River, or both, with respect to those phases with which either of the States, acting alone, cannot deal effectively: Therefore be it

Resolved hy the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled^ That the consent of Congress, subject to the provisions and conditions of section 2 of this joint resolution, is hereby given to the States of New York and New Jersey for the New York-New Jersey Transportation Agency Compact, and to each and every part and article thereof: Provided,^ That nothing contained in said compact shall be construed as impairing or in any manner affecting any right or jurisdiction of the United States in and over the region which forms the subject of the compact or the power of Congress, pursuant to the United States Constitution, over interstate or foreign commerce. Such compact reads as follows:

"NEW YORK-NEW JERSEY TRANSPORTATION AGENCY COMPACT

"ARTICLE 1
"LEGISLATIVE DECLARATION
"1.1 Findings and policy. The legislatures of the State of New York and the State of New Jersey, respectively, hereby find and declare that:
" ( a ) Provision for efficient and proper transportation of commuters and other persons by public mass transit inethpds within and

576

PUBLIC LAW 86-302-SEPT. 21, 1959

[73 STAT.

between the states of New York and New Jersey is essential to the commerce, defense, and general welfare of the two states, and is in the public interest.
" ( b ) Recent trends toward decay of existing mass transit systems, particularly in respect to those carrying passengers to or across the Hudson river or both, have created a condition of impending emergency requiring prompt action for the establishment on an interim basis of an operating system or systems designed to make the most effective use of existing facilities and services with the least financial hardship upon the operators thereof consistent with public needs.
"(c) The present and future transit needs of the two states call for prompt development of an interim plan for the coordinated and integrated use of existing transit facilities and services, as well as for preparation of a long-range plan for a more permanent resolution of these problems. Present uncertainties as to the nature and extent of any acceptable and feasible long-range plan, as well as to the capital and operating costs of such a plan, require that such questions be inquired into upon the basis of experience accumulated in the operation of an interim plan.
" ( d ) I t is therefore the policy of the two states to provide a method for the common handling and disposition by a single agency of the two states of those phases of the development and execution of an interim plan and the preparation of a long-range plan with which either of the states, acting alone, cannot deal effectively.
"(e) The development and execution of an interim plan, as well as the preparation of a general plan, can and should be accomplished by a bi-state agency, to serve as an agency of the states and to have the full assistance and cooperation by all persons and agencies, private and public, of either or both of the states within the proper limits of its own functions and duties.
"1.2. Means to be employed. The legislatures of the states of New York and New Jersey, respectively, further find and declare that the common aspects of the transportation requirements of the two states require concurrent action of the two states to create a bi-state agency, vesting with such power and duties as are necessary and proper for its initial functions, and providing for such additional powers and duties on its part as subsequent concurrent legislation may provide.

"ARTICLE 2
((GENERAL PROVISIONS
"2.1. Definitions. For the purposes of this compact, and of concurrent legislation enacted in furtherance thereof, unless and until the context plainly requires a different meaning:
"(a) 'Transportation agency' means the New York-New Jersey transportation agency established by and pursuant to this compact.
"(b) 'Concurrent legislation' means a statute adopted by one of the states party to this compact which is concurred in by the other state party to this compact in the form of a like enactment.
"(c) 'Facility' or 'transit facility' means any real or personal property, including equipment, and any interest therein, to be used, constructed, acquired, or otherwise provided in connection with the providing of transit services.
"(d) 'Transit', 'transit service', 'mass transit service' or any like term means those activities in the two states that are directed primarily to the transportation of commuters interstate by common carriers and secondarily to such transportation of commuters intrastate and of all other persons interstate and intrastate.

"2.2. Interpretation of the compact. The states of New York and New Jersey intend by this compact to exercise the powers reserved to the states under the constitution of the United States with regard to transit services by whatever facilities or combination thereof are found necessary and proper. This compact shall be liberally construed to effectuate such intention. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed in any way to limit or restrict the power of either state by law or otherwise to deal independently within its own boundaries as to any matter within the scope of this compact so long as any action taken is not in conflict with any plan approved by concurrent legislation.
"ARTICLE 3
"NEW YORK-NEW JERSEY TRANSPORTATION AGENCY
"3.1. Transportation agency created. There is hereby created an agency, which shall be an interstate body, both corporate and politic, to serve as a public agency of the states of New York and New Jersey in dealing with matters affecting public mass transit within and between the two states.

The territorial jurisdiction of the transportation agency may be enlarged or reduced by concurrent legislation hereafter enacted.
"3.4. Administrative orgamzation. (a) The transportation agency shall be composed of two members, one of whom shall be designated by the governor of each of the states with the advice and consent of the senate of such state unless otherwise provided by the law of the state for which such member is designated. Each member of the transportation agency shall be a person who is an official of the State for which he is designated and whose official duties within the state include the duty of dealing with transportation problems.

All such negotiations shall be directed to the execution of operating and facility agreements which shall contain provisions rendering the same binding upon the parties thereto on condition that all related agreements therein specified shall be entered into and that all of such agreements be approved by concurrent legislation.
" ( b ) Upon the basis of such negotiations and agreements, the transportation agency shall prepare for submission to the governors and legislatures of the two states an interim plan or plans for the most efficient use of existing transit facilities and services, and of such additional transit facilities and services as may be provided in such agreements, all by the present operators thereof whenever possible, for the approval thereof by concurrent legislation. In the preparation of any such interim plan, the transportation agency shall have the assistance and cooperation of any governmental agency or agencies of either or both of the states which may have information, data, personnel, or experience of value to the transportation agency for the better performance of its duties. All such agencies are directed to extend full assistance and cooperation to the transportation agency in furtherance thereof. Any such interim plan so submitted shall have annexed to it

"The Secretary may effect the deferments hereunder subject to such conditions and provisions relating to the operation and maintenance of the project involved as he deems to be in the interest of the United States. If, however, any deferments would affect installments to accrue more than twelve months after the action of deferment, they shall be effected only by a formal supplemental contract.

The Secretary shall report to the Congress all deferments granted under this subsection."

Any member of the Agua Caliente Band (hereinafter called the "band") who is living on the date of the enactment of this Act and who has not received an allotment of land shall be given an allotment in accordance with the provisions of law existing prior to this Act. No further allotments of land shall thereafter be made to any other or future born members of the band, or to their heirs or devisees, except for the purpose of equalization. This prohibition against further allotments shall not be construed as a closing of the band's membership rolls.
SEC. 3. (a) The Secretary shall determine on the basis of the contract appraisals that were made in 1957 and 1958 (1) the value of all unallotted tribal land, and (2) the value of the allotment of each allottee who is living on the date of this Act, excluding the value of any improvements thereon.

Such unallotted tribal land shall then be allotted to those members who have received allotments with a value that is less than the equalization figure deemed feasible in accordance with procedures prescribed by the Secretary. No selection of an allotment pursuant to such procedures shall create a vested right in the land until all selections authorized by this Act have been made, included in one schedule, and approved by the Secretary. Allotments thereafter made shall be subject to the same laws and regulations that apply to other trust allotments on the Agua Caliente Reservation. (d) The unallotted portions of section 18, township 4 south, range 5 east, and section 12, township 4 south, range 4 east, that are in the municipal airport for the city of Palm Springs shall be subject to allotment as a part of the equalization program, subject to the following qualifications: If within thirty days after the date of this Act a majority of the adult members of the band who are eligible to vote agree, the Secretary may offer to sell such land to the city for its

commodities and the products thereof produced in the United States

to assist the economic development of friendly nations by providing

long-term credit for purchases of surplus agricultural commodities

for domestic consumption during periods of economic development so

that the resources and manpower of such nations may be utilized more

effectively for industrial and other domestic economic development

without jeopardizing meanwhile adequate supplies of agricultural

commodities for domestic use.

"SEC. 402. I n furtherance of this purpose, the President is author-

ized to enter into agreements with friendly nations under which the

United States shall undertake to provide for delivery annually of

certain quantities of such surplus agricultural commodities for periods

of not to exceed ten years, pursuant to the terms and conditions set

out in this title, providing such commodities are in surplus at the" time

delivery is to be made.

"SEC. 403. Payment for such commodities shall be in dollars with

interest at such rate as the Secretary may determine but not more than

the cost of the funds to the United States Treasury as determined by

the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current

average market yields on outstanding marketable obligations of the

United States having maturity comparable to the maturities of loans

made by the President under this section. Payment may be made in

approximately equal annual amounts over periods of not to exceed

twenty years from the date of the last delivery of commodities in each

calendar year under the agreement and interest shall be computed

from the date of such last delivery.

"SEC. 404. In carrying out the provisions of this title, the Secretary

of Agriculture shall endeavor to maximize the sale of United States

agricultural commodities taking such reasonable precautions as he

determines necessary to avoid replacing any sales which the Secretary

finds and determines would otherwise be made for cash dollars.

"SEC. 405. In entering into such agreements, the Secretary shall

endeavor to reach agreement with other exporting nations of such

commodities for their participation in the supply and assistance pro-

gram herein authorized on a proportionate and equitable basis.

"(2) EXCHANGES OF TRANSFERABLE OBLIGATIONS ISSUED AT NOT
LESS THAN PAR.--In any case in which subsection (a) (or so much of section 1031 (b) or (c) as relates to subsection (a) of this section) has applied to the exchange of a transferable obligation which was issued at not less than par for another transferable obligation, the issue price of the obligation received fix>m the Government in the exchange shall be considered for purposes of api)lying section 1232 to be the same as the issue price of the obligation surrendered to the Government in the exchange, increased by the amount of other consideration (if any) paid to the United States as a p a r t of the exchange.
"(c) CROSS EEFERENCES.--
"(1) For rules relating to the recognition of gain or loss in a case where subsection (a) would apply except for the fact that the exchange was not made solely for other obligations of the United States, see subsections (b) and (c) of section 1031.
"(2) For rules relating to the basis of obligations of the United States acquired in an exchange for other obligations described in subsection (a), see subsection (d) of section 1031."

Upon approval of such organization certificate by the Director it shall be the charter of the corporation, and one of the originals thereof shall be delivered to the corporation after the payment of the fee required therefor. Upon such approval the Federal credit union shall be a body corporate and as such, subject to the limitations herein contained, shall be vested with all of the powers and charged with all of the liabilities conferred and imposed by this Act upon corporations organized hereunder.

"(c) The Commissioner may accept any mortgage for insurance under this section without regard to any requirement in any other section of this Act that the property or project be economically sound.
"(d) The Commissioner shall require each project covered by a mortgage insured under this section to be held for rental for a period of not less than five years after the project or dwelling is made available for initial occupancy or until advised by the Secretary of Defense or his designee that the housing may be released from such rental condition. The Commissioner shall prescribe such procedures as in his judgment are necessary to secure reasonable preference or priority in the sale or rental of dwellings covered by a mortgage insured under this section for military personnel and essential civilian employees of the armed services, and employees of contractors for the armed services, as evidenced by certification issued by the Secretary of Defense or his designee. Such certificate shall be conclusive evidence to the Commissioner of the employment status of the person requiring housing and of such person's need for the housing.
"(e) F o r the purpose of providing multifamily rental housing projects or housing projects consisting of individual single-family dwellings for sale, the Commissioner is authorized to insure mortgages (including advances on such mortgages during construction) which cover property held by a private corporation, association, cooperative society, or trust. Any such mortgagor shall possess powers necessary therefor and incidental thereto and shall until the termination of all obligations of the Commissioner under such insurance be regulated or restricted as to rents or sales, charges, capital structure, rate of return, and methods of operation to such extent and in such manner as to provide reasonable rentals to tenants and a reasonable return on the investment. The Commissioner may make such contracts with, and acquire for not to exceed $100 such stock or interest in, any such corporation, association, cooperative society, or trust as he may deem necessary to render effective such restriction or regulation. Such stock or interest shall be paid for out of the Armed Services Housing Mortgage Insurance Fund, and shall be redeemed by the corporation, association, cooperative society, or trust at par upon the termination of all obligations of the Commissioner under the insurance.
"(f) To be eligible for insurance under this section, a mortgage on any multifamily rental property or project shall involve a principal obligation in an amount (1) not to exceed $5,000,000 or (2) not to exceed, for such part of such property or project as may be attributable to dwelling use, $2,500 per room (or $9,000 per family unit if the number of rooms in such property or project is less than four per family unit), and not to exceed 90 per centum of the estimated value of the property or project when the proposed physical improvements are completed. The Commissioner may increase any of the foregoing dollar amount limitations per room contained in this paragraph by not to exceed $1,000 per room in any geographical area where he finds that cost levels so require.
"(g) To be eligible for insurance under this section a mortgage on any property or project constructed for eventual sale of single-family dwellings shall involve a principal obligation in an amount not to exceed $5,000,000 and not to exceed a sum computed on the basis of a separate mortgage for each single-family dwelling (irrespective of whether such dwelling has a party wall or is otherwise physically con-

"(h) Any mortgage insured under this section shall provide for complete amortization by periodic payments within such terms as the Commissioner may prescribe but not to exceed the maximum term applicable to mortgages under section 207 of this Act and shall bear interest (exclusive of premium charges for insurance) at not to exceed the rate applicable to mortgages insured under section 207, except that individual mortgages of the character described in subsection (g) covering the individual dwellings in the project may have a term not in excess of the maximum term applicable to mortgages insured under section 203 of this Act or the unexpired term of the project mortgage at the time of the release of the mortgaged property from such project mortgage, whichever is the greater, and shall bear interest at not to exceed the rate applicable to mortgages insured under section 203. The Commissioner may consent to the release of a part or parts of the mortgaged property from the lien of the mortgage upon such terms and conditions as he may prescribe and the mortgage may provide for such release, and a mortgage of the character described in subsection (g) of this section may provide that, at any time after the release of the project from the rental period prescribed by subsection (d), such mortgage may be replaced, in whole or in part, by individual^ mortgages covering each individual dwelling in the project in amounts not to exceed the unpaid balance of the blanket mortgage allocable to the individual property. Each such individual mortgage may be insured under this section. Property covered by a mortgage insured under this section msij include eight or more family units and may include such commercial and community facilities as the Commissioner deems adequate to serve the occupants.
"(i) The aggregate number of dwelling units (including all units in multifamily projects or individual dwellings) covered by outstanding commitments to insure and mortgages insured under this section shall at no time exceed five thousand dwelling units.
"(j) The provisions of subsections ( d ) , (e), ( g ) , ( h ) , ( i ) , ( j ) , (k), (1), ( m ) , ( n ) , and (p) of section 207 of this title shall be applicable to mortgages insured under this section except individual mortgages of the character described in subsection (g) of this section covering the individual dwellings in the project, and as to such individual mortgages the provisions of subsections ( a ) , (c), ( d ) , (e), (f)» (g)) ( h ) , ( j ) , and (k) of section 204 shall be applicable: Provided. That wherever the words 'Fund', 'Mutual Mortgage Insurance F u n d , or 'Housing Insurance Fund' appear in section 204 or 207, such reference shall refer to the Armed Services Housing Mortgage Insurance Fund with respect to mortgages insured under this section,
" ( k ) The provisions of sections 801, 802, 803(c), 803(i), 803(j), 804(a), 804(b), and 807 and the provisions of section 803(a) relating to the aggregate amount of all mortgages insured and the expiration date of the Commissioner's authority to insure under this title shall be applicable to mortgages insured under this section.
"(1) If the Commissioner determines that insurance of mortgages on any housing of the type described in this section is not an acceptable risk, he may require the Secretary of Defense to guarantee the Armed Services Housing Mortgage Insurance Fund from loss with respect to mortgages insured pursuant to this section. There are hereby authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to provide for payment to meet losses arising from such guaranty."

CONCURRENT RESOLUTIONS-SEPT. 10, 1959 [73 S T A T .

Whereas mining and the extraction of minerals from Federal, State, and privately owned lands situated within the United States and its Territories and possessions are basic industries upon which the transporting, processing, and distributing industries and the consumers of the Nation depend; and
Whereas the interests of national security have brought about Government programs for the establishment and maintenance of national stockpiles of strategically important metals and minerals and for the development of mine and plant capacities for the production thereof; and
Whereas the administration of these and related programs, through Government purchases, contracts, loans, grants, technical assistance, barter, and other means, has resulted in the abnormal and artificial stimulation of foreign metal and mineral exploration and development and the expansion of foreign capacities for the production of metals and minerals; and
Whereas increased foreign production of certain metals and minerals, together with downward revision of national stockpile requirements, has resulted in depressed domestic prices for these materials, drastic curtailment of domestic production, economic disaster to individual firms, hardships for dependent industries, extensive unemployment, and severe contraction of business in the affected communities; and
Whereas an emergency exists since further delays in the recovery of the domestic mining and mineral industries would cause irreparable damage to mining and mineral properties, wastage of human and natural resources, and loss of productive capacity, and would have a depressing effect upon the national economy and threaten national security; and
Whereas all governmental efforts to date have not been effective in alleviating these detrimental effects: Now, therefore, be it
Resolved hy the House of Representatives {the Senate concurring)^ That the President is requested--
(a) to have reviews made at once of the existing programs of the departments and agencies of the executive branch with the purpose of using them more effectively to provide for increased production and employment in critically depressed domestic mining and mineral industries;
(b) to advise the Congress at the earliest possible date as to the actions taken or proposed to be taken to this end; and
(c) to submit any reorganization plans or recommendations for legislation that may be necessary to accomplish this objective. SEC. 2. I t is the sense of the Congress that it is in the national interest to foster and encourage (a) the maintenance and development of a sound and stable domestic mining and minerals industry; (b) the orderly discovery and development of domestic mineral resources and reserves on Federal, State, and privately owned lands; and (c) mining, mineral, metallurgical, and marketing research to promote the wise and efficient uses of domestic metal and mineral resources. SEC. 3. I t is the sense of the Congress that the maintenance and development of a sound and stable domestic mining and minerals industry, without critical dependence upon foreign sources, is essential to national security and the welfare of the consuming public, and that this objective is independent of and cannot be accomplished by the maintenance of national stockpiles for planned defense needs in a single emergency or the existence of productive capacity based upon the importation of foreign materials.

September 22 1958 [No. 3257]

1. W H E R E A S , pursuant to the authority vested in him by the Constitution and the statutes, including section 350 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1351), the President, on October 30, 1947, entered into a trade agreement with foreign countries, which consists of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the related Protocol of Provisional Application thereof, together with the Final Act Adopted at the Conclusion of the Second Session of the Preparatory Committee of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Employment (61 Stat. (Parts 5 and 6) A 7, A 11, and A 2051), and, by Proclamation No. 2761A of December 16, 1947 (61 Stat. (Part 2) 1103), proclaimed such modifications of existing duties and other import restrictions of the United States and such continuance of existing customs or excise treatment of articles imported into the United States as were then found to be required or appropriate to carry out that agreement on and after January 1, 1948;
2. WHEREAS, pursuant to the said authority, the President, on April 21, 1951, entered into a trade agreement consisting of the Torquay Protocol to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, including the annexes thereto (3 UST (Part 1) 588), and, by Proclamation No. 2929 of June 2, 1951 (3 CFR, 1951 Supp., p. 27), proclaimed such modification of existing duties and other import restrictions of the United States and such continuance of existing customs
or excise treatment of articles imported into the United States as were then found to be required or appropriate to carry out that agreement on and after June 6, 1951, which proclamation has been supplemented by several notifications of the President to the Secretary of the Treasury, including a notification dated June 2, 1951 (3 CFR, 1951 Supp., p. 530);

5. W H E R E A S , in accordance with Articles I I and X I of the said

^61 Stat. (pt. 5) A14, General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the United States customs

treatment reflecting the concessions granted in the said trade agree-

ments with respect to the articles described in the items reproduced

in the third and fourth recitals of this proclamation has been the

application of the respective rates of duty specified in such items,

without quantitative limitation;

6. WHEREAS the United States Tariff Commission has sub-

mitted to me a report of its Investigation No. 65 under section 7 of

the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1951, as amended (19 U.S.C.

1364), as a result of which the Commission has found that the articles

described in the said items (except Babbitt metal, solder, and zinc

dust) are, as a result in part of the customs treatment specified in the

fifth recital of this proclamation, being imported into the United

States in such increased quantities, both actual and relative, as to

cause serious injury to the domestic industries producing like or

directly competitive products;

7. W H E R E A S I find that the modifications of the concessions

granted in the said agreements with respect to such articles to permit

the application to such articles of the customs treatment hereinafter

proclaimed is necessary to remedy the serious injury to the domestic

industries producing like or directly competitive products;

or appropriate to carry out any foreign trade agreement that the

President has entered into under the said section 350; and

9. W H E R E A S , upon modification of the said concessions as here-

inafter proclaimed, it will be appropriate, to carry out the General

Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, to apply to the said articles the

customs treatment hereinafter proclaimed:

W H E R E A S I find and declare that adjustments must be made in the imports of crude oil, unfinished oils, and finished products, so that such imports will not so threaten to impair the national security; and

W H E R E A S I find and declare that the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico largely depends upon imported crude oil, unfinished oils, and finished products and that any system for the adjustment of imports of such commodities should permit imports into Puerto Rico adequate for the purposes of local consumption, export to foreign areas, and limited shipment of finished products to the continental United States:
NOW, THEREFORE, I, DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER, President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 2 of the act of July 1, 1954, as amended, do hereby proclaim as follows:
SEC 1. (a) In Districts I-IV, District V, and in Puerto Rico, on and after March 11, 1959, no crude oil or unfinished oils may be entered for consumption or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, and on and after April 1, 1959, no finished products may be entered for consumption or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, except (1) by or for the account of a person to whom a license has been issued by the Secretary of the Interior pursuant to an allocation made to such person by the Secretary in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary, and such entries and withdrawals may be made only in accordance with the terms of such license, or (2) as authorized by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, or (3) as to finished products, by or for the account of a department, establishment, or agency of the United States, which shall not be required to have such a license but which shall be subject to the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section.
(b) Until the Secretary of the Interior is able to make allocations and issue licenses, he may, subject to such conditions as he may deem appropriate, temporarily authorize such entries and withdrawals without licenses and the quantities so entered or withdrawn shall be deducted from any allocation subsequently made by the Secretary to any person who has made any such entry or withdrawal.
(c) In Districts I-IV, District V, and in Puerto Rico, on and after April 1, 1959, no department, establishment, or agency of the United States shall import finished products in excess of the respective allocations made to them by the Secretary of the Interior. Such allocations shall be within the maximum levels of imports established in section 2 of this proclamation.
SEC. 2. (a) (1) In Districts I - I V the maximum level of imports of crude oil, unfinished oils, and finished products, except residual fuel oil to be used as fuel, shall be approximately 9 % of total demand in these districts, as estimated by the Bureau of Mines for periods fixed by the Secretary of the Interior. Within this maximum level, imports of finished products, exclusive of residual fuel oil to be used as fuel, shall not exceed the level of imports of such products into these districts during the calendar year 1957 and imports of unfinished oils shall not exceed 10% of the permissible imports of crude oil and unfinished oils.
(2) In Districts I - I V the imports of residual fuel oil to be used as fuel shall not exceed the level of imports of that product into these districts during the calendar year 1957.
(b) In District V the maximum level of imports of crude oil, unfinished oils, and finished products shall be an amount which, together with domestic production and supply, will approximate total demand in this district as estimated by the Bureau of Mines for periods fixed by the Secretary. Within this maximum level imports of finished products shall not exceed the level of imports of such products

into this district during the calendar year 1957 and imports of unfinished oils shall not exceed 10% of the permissible imports of crude oil and unfinished oils.
(c) Such additional imports of crude oil may be permitted in addition to the maximum levels established in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section as are necessary to meet the minimum requirements of refiners, and pipeline companies using crude oil directly as fuel, which are not able to obtain sufficient quantities of domestic crude oil by ordinary and continuous means, such as by barges, pipelines, or tankers.
(d) The maximum level of imports of crude oil, unfinished oils, and finished products into Puerto Rico shall be approximately the level of imports into Puerto Rico during all or part of the calendar year 1958, as determined by the Secretary of the Interior to be consonant with the purposes of this proclamation, or such lower or higher levels as the Secretary jnaj subsequently determine are required to meet increases or decreases in local demand in Puerto Rico or demand for export to foreign areas.
(e) The Secretary of the Interior shall keep under review the imports into Districts I - I V and into District V of residual fuel oil to be used as fuel and the Secretary may make, on a monthly basis if required, such adjustments in the maximum level of such imports as he may determine to be consonant with the objectives of this proclamation.
(f) The levels established, and the total demand referred to, in this section do not include free withdrawals bv persons pursuant to section 309 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1309), or petroleum supplies for vessels or aircraft operated by the United States between points referred to in said section 309 (as to vessels or aircraft, respectively) or between any point in the United States or its possessions and any point in a foreign country.
SEC. 3. (a) The Secretary of the Interior is hereby authorized to issue regulations for the purpose of implementing this proclamation. Such regulations shall be consistent with the levels established in this proclamation for imports of crude oil, unfinished oils, and finished products into Districts I-IV, into District V, and into Puerto Rico, and shall provide for a system of allocation of the authorized imports of such crude oil, unfinished oils and finished products and for the issuance of licenses pursuant to such system, with such restrictions upon the transfer of allocations and licenses as may be deemed appropriate to further the purposes of this proclamation.
(b) (1) With respect to the allocations of imports of crude oil and unfinished oils into Districts I-IV, and into District V, such regulations shall provide, to the extent possible, for a fair and equitable distribution among persons having refinery capacity in these districts in relation to refinery inputs during an appropriate period or periods selected by the Secretary and may provide for distribution in such manner as to avoid drastic reductions below the last allocations under the Voluntary Oil Import Program. Such regulations also shall provide for allocations of crude oil to persons having operating refinery capacity or having pipeline facilities using crude oil directly as fuel who show inability to obtain sufficient quantities of domestic crude oil by ordinary and continuous means, such as barges, pipelines, or tankers.
(2) Such regulations shall provide for the allocation of imports of crude oil and unfinished oils into Puerto Rico among persons having refinery capacity in Puerto Rico in relation to refinery inputs during all or a part of the calendar year 1958 as the Secretary may determine.

However, persons receiving allocations of crude oil on the basis of inability to obtain sufficient domestic crude by ordinary and continuous means shall not be permitted to make exchanges.
(4) With respect to the allocations of imports of finished products into Districts I-IV, District V, and Puerto Rico, such regulations shall, to the extent possible, result in a fair and equitable distribution of such products among persons who have been importers of finished products during the respective base periods specified in section 2 of this proclamation.
(c) Such regulations may provide for the revocation or suspension by the Secretary of any allocation or license on grounds relating to the national security, or the violation of the terms of this proclamation, or of any regulation or license issued pursuant to this proclamation.

Such representatives shall be of the rank of Deputy Assistant Secretary or higher. The Appeal Board may be empowered, on grounds of hardship, error, or other relevant special consideration, but within the limits of the maximum levels of imports established in section 2 of this proclamation (1) to modify any allocation made to any person under the regulations issued pursuant to section 3 of this proclamation, (2) to grant allocations of crude oil and unfinished oils in special circumstances to persons with importing histories who do not qualify for allocations under such regulations; and (3) to review the revocation or suspension of any allocation or license. The Secretary may provide that such decisions by the Appeal Board shall be final.
SEC. 5. Persons who apply for allocations of crude oil, unfinished oils, or finished products and persons to whom such allocations have been made shall furnish to the Secretary of the Interior such information and shall make such reports as he may require, by regulation or otherwise, in the discharge of his responsibilities under this proclamation.
SEC. 6. (a) The Director of the Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization shall maintain a constant surveillance of imports of petroleum and its primary derivatives in respect of the national security and, after consultation with the Secretaries of State, Defense, Treasury, the Interior, Commerce, and Labor, he shall inform the President of any circumstances which, in the Director's opinion might indicate the need for further Presidential action under section 2 of the act of July 1, 1954, as amended. In the event prices of crude oil or its products or derivatives should be increased after the effective date of this proclamation, such surveillance shall include a determination as to whether such increase or increases are necessary to accomplish the national security objectives of the act of July 1, 1954, as amended, and of this proclamation.

A PROCLAMATION
WHEREAS history records that our Nation was born in struggle and turbulence; that it has survived recurring crises which have tried the souls of men; and t h a t the maintenance of our freedom has required constant vigilance, unified strength, and the willingness of our people to make all necessary sacrifices; and
W H E R E A S we are accustomed to join together on one day of each year in grateful tribute to our forebears and to our fellow citizens who have given their lives for us on the field of battle; and
WHEREAS, since we must seek to know, to accept, and to accomplish the will of Almighty God, and since we believe it to be His will that peace on earth shall some day prevail, it is fitting that we pray for Divine help in building a world in which the families of men may prosper together in justice and in honor; and
WHEREAS the Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 11, 1950 (64 Stat. 158), authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to observe May 30 of each year, which is Memorial Day, by praying, each in accordance with his own religious faith, for permanent peace:
NOW, THEREFORE, I, DWIGHT D.

I call upon the newspapers, radio, television, and other media of information to assist in this observance. And I urge the people of the United States to join with one another in asking our Creator to bestow His benediction upon our fallen heroes, and in beseeching Him to give us the strength to go forward in confidence with what we have come to think we know--and in the right God gives us to see.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.

IMPOSING QUOTAS ON IMPORTS OF R Y E , R Y E FLOUR, AND R Y E M E A L BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

August 4,1959 [No. 3306]

A PROCLAMATION

W H E R E A S , pursuant to section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment ^ g^^^ ^^, ^^ g^^^ Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 624), the Secretary of Agriculture advised 75; 67 stat. 472. me that there was reason to believe that rye, rye flour, and rye meal are practically certain to be imported into the United States under such conditions and in such quantities as to render or tend to render ineffective, or materially interfere with, the price-support program undertaken by the Department of Agriculture with respect to rye ggg^.^^ ^053 pursuant to sections 301 and 401 of the Agricultural Act of 1949, 7 use 1447,1421. as amended, or to reduce substantially the amount of products processed in the United States from domestic rye with respect to which such program of the Department of Agriculture is being undertaken; and
WHEREAS, on June 23, 1959, I caused the United States Tariff Commission to make an investigation under section 22 with respect to this matter; and
WHEREAS the Tariff Commission has made such investigation and has reported to me its findings and recommendations made in connection therewith; and
W H E R E A S , on the basis of the investigation and report of the Tariff Commission, I find that rye, rye flour, and rye meal, in the aggregate, are practically certain to be imported into the United States under such conditions and in such quantities as to interfere materially with, and to tend to render ineffective, the price-support program with respect to rye, and to reduce substantially the amount of products processed in the United States from domestic rye with respect to which the price-support program is being undertaken; and
W H E R E A S I find and declare that the imposition of the quantitative limitations hereinafter proclaimed is shown by such investigation of the Tariff Commission to be necessary in order that the entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption of rye, rye flour, and rye meal will not render ineffective, or materially interfere with, such price-support program; and
W H E R E A S I find that the quantitative limitations hereinafter proclaimed will not reduce the permissible total quantity of rye,

EXPLANATION
General. The following tables are designed to serve as a guide to prior laws and other Federal instruments which are patently amended, repealed, referred to, or otherwise cited by the textual provisions of the public laws contained in this volume. These tables were initiated as a separate pamphlet to accompany Volume 70 of the United States Statutes at Large. Beginning with Volume 71, they are being published as an integral part of each volume. From time to time the tables will be cumulated and made separately available as a convenience to users. Coverage and arrangement are subject to change with a view to improved usefulness. The arrangement of the tables is outlined above. There are two basic groups: (1) Tables 1-10 cover amendments, repeals, and other actions directly affecting prior laws and other Federal instruments; and (2) Tables 11-19 cover all citations and other references to prior laws and other Federal instruments.
Details of Arrangement.
Tables 1-9 are limited to cases in which prior laws and other Federal instruments are expressly affected.
Table 10 is a catch-all table designed as a finding aid to relationships which are expressed in general terms. Listed in this table are all public laws in this volume which contain such provisions as "notwithstanding any other provision of law," and "all laws in conflict with this law are hereby repealed."
Dl

D2

LAWS AFFECTED IN VOLUME 73

Tables 11-19 cover all other cases in which prior laws or other Federal instruments are mentioned in the text of the public laws in this volume, without regard to the purpose underlying such reference.
In each of the basic groups the first and largest table is entitled "General Legislation," and contains listings of all laws affected which have not been codified in the Revised Statutes, the Internal Revenue Codes, or in those titles of the United States Code which have been enacted into positive law. Succeeding tables cover these codified provisions, as well as other instruments such as reorganization plans, veterans' regulations, Executive orders and proclamations, and treaties and international agreements. The numbering of the tables in the two groups is parallel. Thus Table 2 and Table 12 both relate to the Revised Statutes; Table 7 and Table 17 both relate to veterans' regulations.
Table 1 is arranged chronologically. In preparing this table the "basic act"
fegislation will be found under the basic act affected, rather than under intervening )rinciple has been followed. Under this principle the key listing of amendatory
amendments thereto. Furthermore, all laws included are treated as if tables covering prior volumes of the United States Statutes at Large were in existence. Thus, no attempt is made to give an historical picture of a law, and only the latest amendment in the chain will be reflected. Occasionally, to promote clarity, cross references have been supplied at key points.
Users of Table 1 should, therefore, look under the date or statutes volume and
Eage number of the basic act affected, in order to determine whether changes have een made by the public laws contained in this volume. Although a given section of any act may have been added at a later date, the section is carried under the date and statutes citation of the basic act. For this reason the page numbers in the column headed "Statutes volume and page" are the numbers of the page on which each act begins.
All tables are arranged chronologically, except where the existence of a system of codification makes possible a sequential arrangement from the lowest to the highest title or section number. In Tables 1-10 there is a "Comment" column, in which the nature of the affecting action is described. These are editorial comments, intended to reflect what is patent in the laws reviewed, and every effort has been made to avoid interpretations.
In Tables 11-19 the "Comment" column is unnecessary, since in each instance the comment would be "Cited" or "Referred to." In these tables, moreover, the number of columns has been held to a minimum in the interest of brevity. Thus Table 11 contains only three columns listing the date and number of the law referred to, and the page number in this volume at which the reference may be found.
Caveat.
All the tables are editorially compiled and presented as reference guides onlyHence they have no evidentiary status or legal effect. Indirect or implied relationships are not included. These may be found through use of the Subject Index or throij^h research based on the text itself.
The Office of the Federal Register invites criticisms or suggestions with a view to improving the tables wherever possible.
